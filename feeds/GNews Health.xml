							&lt;p&gt;My 72-year-old neighbor just helped me move a couch up three flights of stairs. Afterwards, while I caught my breath, she mentioned she'd already done her morning swim. "I'm slowing down," she said, genuinely believing it. That's when I realized: the people aging best often have no idea they're exceptional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We obsess over wrinkles and gray hair while missing what actually matters. The real markers of healthy aging aren't visible in bathroom mirrors—they're revealed in grocery stores, conversations, and the thousand small negotiations of daily life. These signs have nothing to do with looking younger and everything to do with staying fully alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. You can get up from the floor without using your hands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it: sit cross-legged on the floor, then stand up. No hands, no knees, no furniture assists. Just rise. This simple move, called the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250404-sit-to-stand-the-simple-test-that-reveals-how-youre-ageing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sit-rise test&lt;/a&gt;, predicts longevity better than most medical exams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not about flexibility or strength alone—it's about coordination, balance, and something researchers call "functional reserve." People who can do this past 50 have maintained the complex integration of systems that most lose gradually, then suddenly. It means your body still works as a unit, not a collection of failing parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. You still change your mind about big things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When did your parents last admit they were wrong about something important? Real cognitive flexibility—not just learning new phone apps but actually revising core beliefs—is one of the strongest predictors of healthy brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aging brain's default is to crystallize, to defend positions rather than examine them. If you've changed your stance on something significant in the past year—politics, relationships, career priorities—your brain is maintaining its plasticity. You're not just learning; you're still capable of unlearning, which is infinitely harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Your friends span multiple decades&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at who you spend time with. If your social circle includes people 20 years younger and older, you're defeating one of aging's sneakiest threats: generational isolation. Most people unconsciously age-sort themselves, sliding into demographic bubbles that reinforce their obsolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intergenerational friendships keep you culturally bilingual. You're not trying to be young or accepting being old—you're just being present across the full spectrum of life. The 30-year-old who seeks your advice and the 80-year-old who makes you laugh are both keeping you alive in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. You're still bad at things (on purpose)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When did you last feel like a complete beginner? Not frustrated by technology, but actively choosing to be terrible at something new—pottery, languages, pickleball. The willingness to be publicly incompetent is a superpower that most people surrender by 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557811/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Neuroplasticity research&lt;/a&gt; shows that novel challenges create new neural pathways at any age. But here's the kicker: the benefit comes from the struggle, not the mastery. Your brain needs the humiliation of being bad at things. Those who age best never stop volunteering for beginner status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. You sleep through the night without medication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every night, but most nights. No Ambien, no 3 AM anxiety spirals, no revenge bedtime procrastination. Just sleep, the kind that actually repairs your brain and body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't about virtue—it's about system integrity. Good sleep past 50 means your &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aah4968" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;circadian rhythms&lt;/a&gt;, hormone levels, and stress responses are still synchronized. While peers pop melatonin and scroll through WebMD at 2 AM, you're getting the cellular renovation that keeps everything else functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. You can hear conversations in restaurants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not perfectly, but you can track dialogue in a noisy room without exhaustion. This isn't just about ear health—it's about something called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8784007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cognitive spare capacity&lt;/a&gt;. Your brain can still filter, process, and comprehend complex audio environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don't realize how much aging happens in the spaces between our senses and our processing. When restaurant conversation becomes work, social life shrinks. Those who can still engage in chaotic sound environments maintain connection to the loud, messy, vital world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. You're planning something for five years from now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not dreaming, not hoping—actually planning. A trip, a project, a move. Something that assumes you'll be capable and interested in the future. This psychological time horizon, what researchers call "&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0197455624000558#:~:text=Future%20time%20perspective%20is%20a,that%20are%20difficult%20to%20discuss." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;future time perspective&lt;/a&gt;,"separates thriving from surviving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people unconsciously shrink their temporal horizons with age, planning months ahead instead of years. But those aging best still plant trees they'll sit under, start books series they'll finish, make plans that assume future vitality. They're not in denial about mortality—they just refuse to rehearse for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret about aging well: it's not defeating time but staying interested in it. Every marker above shares this—engagement over withdrawal, curiosity over certainty, connection over isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stair-climbing neighbor doesn't do yoga or drink green juice. She does something more radical: she assumes tomorrow will require her full presence, so she maintains capacity for it. She keeps functional not from vanity but from practical optimism—believing life will keep asking things of her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real healthy aging isn't measured by how young you look but how far forward you're still reaching. It's maintaining what gerontologists call "openness to experience"—the opposite of the slow closing that marks decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're aging well when the future feels worth preparing for, when your body remains a vehicle rather than a betrayal, when you can still surprise yourself with your own opinions. These aren't just luck or genetics—they're choices, accumulated daily, to stay in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mirror lies. These signs don't. And perhaps the biggest sign you're aging well is this: you're more interested in what you're becoming than what you're losing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I remember, not so long ago, when every young guy in the gym would come and ask me, “How do I get bigger &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/fitness/walking/calves-shins-walking/"&gt;calves&lt;/a&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As my client base has gradually become older, this doesn’t tend to happen so often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But should we all actually be thinking about this often-forgotten muscle as we get older?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those of us with larger calves are less likely to &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/bones-joints/osteoporosis-ageing-bones/"&gt;fall and break bones&lt;/a&gt;. But we’re also more likely to have better &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/three-easy-ways-stabilise-blood-sugar-levels/"&gt;blood sugar management&lt;/a&gt;, better &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/10/16/standing-desks-sydney-university-circulation-thrombosis/"&gt;circulation&lt;/a&gt; and better &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/ageing/habits-to-keep-brain-young-superagers/"&gt;cognition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So targeting our calf muscles in midlife and beyond makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The benefits of strong calf muscles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Better heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The calf is made up of two key muscles, the gastrocnemius and the soleus, which lies beneath it. The soleus muscle is often referred to as the “second heart” because of the huge pump effect it has at returning deoxygenated blood back up towards the heart. The stronger our lower limb muscles, the greater this pump effect and the better our circulation. This then has a massive impact on &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/heart-health/how-to-prevent-a-heart-attack/"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s no surprise, then, that research shows a link between higher calf strength and improved cardiovascular health, including lower blood pressure and a lower risk of heart failure after a &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/heart-health/warning-signs-of-heart-disease-attack-symptoms/"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Brain health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may seem odd, but strong calf muscles are also associated with better brain health, with researchers suggesting a calf size of at least 33cm for women and 34 cm for men as protective. Why might this be? Clearly, a strong calf muscle does not by itself lead to better brain function. However, as we’ve already noted, strong leg muscles lead to greater blood flow, and we know that more oxygenated blood to the brain reduces cognitive decline. In addition, those of us with strong calves are more likely to be speedy walkers or to play sports. Studies show that people who &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/fitness/walking/health-benefits-of-walking/"&gt;walk&lt;/a&gt; faster have slower cognitive decline, and the same goes for those who play racquet sports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do strong calves make healthy brains? No, but strong lower bodies make for active people, and active people are more sociable, and greater sociability keeps us young in every way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Fall prevention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong calves, combined with strong feet and strong shin muscles, play a major role in not only our &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/ageing/exercises-to-avoid-falls-like-elton-john/"&gt;balance&lt;/a&gt; and ability to correct our footing but also our postural alignment. The firmer our footing floor and the stronger the muscles in our lower limbs and feet, the less strain there is on the knees and the hips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How to strengthen your calf muscles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So which muscles do we need to target?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we start with the calf muscles, we can split this muscle group into two major muscles, the gastrocnemius and the soleus. The gastrocnemius is the big muscle that forms the main big belly of the calf as it runs from the femur under the back of the knee to the lower leg. The soleus is the deeper muscle that sits under the gastrocnemius and goes from under the knee and converges on the Achilles tendon at the back of the heel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These muscle groups are responsible for pointing your toes and bending the knee and are used for propulsion movements such as walking, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/fitness/running/how-to-start-running-at-40/"&gt;running&lt;/a&gt; and jumping. If we want to walk faster or for longer or run faster or jump higher, these muscles need to be strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong calves are incredibly important to the strength of the lower limb, working in tandem with our shin muscles and feet&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern shoes and trainers are, on the whole, not designed to benefit our foot strength or shape.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;I see it in the gym when we do squats or lunges with a new client, and you can see the lack of control from the toes and the inability to create a wide balance and contact point with the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should all spend more time with our shoes and socks off and I would suggest doing these calf exercises, or actually any lower body exercises, barefoot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong calves and strong feet is most definitely the ideal combination for anti-ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The best exercises for strong calves&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Single leg hopping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This plyometric exercise targets the calf muscles by requiring explosive power and control during each hop. The repeated push-off and landing motion engages the calves intensely, helping to build strength, endurance and stability.&lt;/p&gt;

Bubblegum. Cherry Cola. They might sound like sweets, but these artificial flavours are part of a chemical cocktail inhaled deep into the lungs by people who vape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Britons are now vaping in unprecedented numbers – around one in ten adults (9.8 per cent) in 2023, rising to 15.8 per cent among 16 to 24-year-olds, according to the Office for National Statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while vapes are generally considered safer than cigarettes, and seen as a useful tool for quitting smoking, experts are warning the effects of the chemicals, solvents, sweeteners and flavourings found in e-cigarettes can have significant health risks, including lung damage – and these are still emerging as it’s a relatively new area of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The potential dangers were spelt out in a 2023 study which found people who vaped had DNA damage in mouth cells at similar levels to cigarette smokers, reported the journal Nicotine &amp;amp; Tobacco Research – the highest levels were seen in people using the pod-style devices now standard in Britain (different from a disposable vape, this has a battery and heating coil, and a replaceable pod containing the liquid).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another study last year found that people who smoke and vape are four times more likely to develop lung &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-4a5a3ca0-921d-11f0-960c-491e20504623"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; than those who just smoke, the Journal of Oncology Research and Therapy reported. The researchers, from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/ohio/index.html" id="mol-4a62ef30-921d-11f0-960c-491e20504623"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; State University, speculated this was due to the amount of chemicals in vapes that may be carcinogenic (cancer-causing) in their own right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s not just the lungs that could be affected: chronic vaping was linked to impaired blood vessel function, which is an early warning sign for heart disease, according to 2024 study in the journal Tobacco Induced Disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vapes contain nicotine, which is a vasoconstrictor, meaning it narrows blood vessels, so it could contribute to cardiovascular problems in people who already have underlying heart disease, explains Lion Shahab, a professor of health psychology at University College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Britons are now vaping in unprecedented numbers – around one in ten adults (9.8 per cent) in 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He adds nicotine may also impair the body’s ability to regulate blood sugar, which could increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, though evidence for this remains inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As Cancer Research UK points out, vaping is much less harmful than smoking. But it is not risk-free, and experts stress children, teenagers and non-smokers should not vape at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts fear exposure during adolescence, when lungs are still developing, could increase the risk of lasting respiratory problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-3be362f0-921d-11f0-960c-491e20504623" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15099583/hidden-vaping-effects-quit-good-guide-addictive.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;DID YOU KNOW? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A black-market ‘thousands-of-puffs’ disposable vape can cost between £5 to £10 from market stalls or via social media, while a legal kit from a supermarket costs around £7 to £13, and about £5 for a 10ml refill. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Indeed, the journal BMC Medicine reported in May last year teenagers in England and North America were more likely to suffer breathing problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Concerned, in February 2025, the UK Government launched a ten-year study that will follow 100,000 children and teenagers aged eight to 18 to track how vaping affects their health over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We are exposing children to an experimental risk,’ Andrew Grigg, a professor of paediatric respiratory medicine at Queen Mary University of London, told Good Health.‘We now have a generation of young people hooked on nicotine and they are inhaling not just nicotine, but a mixture of flavourings and chemicals into developing lungs, substances we know very little about when inhaled’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Grigg explains in lab studies these chemicals reduce key cell functions in the airway and may increase the risk of bacterial infections such as bronchitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We’re already seeing more bronchitis symptoms in children who vape,’ he adds, referring to persistent cough, wheezing and airway inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vaping isn’t the only potential cause, however front line doctors are seeing more under-18s hooked on nicotine vapes turning up with chest tightness, wheeze, persistent cough, palpitations, nausea, headaches and anxiety, it was reported in earlier this year by researchers from Alder Hey Children’s Hospital, and other institutes, who called for dedicated NHS services for children addicted to vaping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This is not a harmless habit,’ says Professor Grigg, ‘and the long-term risks are unknown’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Andrew Grigg, a professor of paediatric respiratory medicine at Queen Mary University of London&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So what exactly is in vapes that makes them potentially so dangerous? Good Health spoke to leading scientists and clinicians...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;WHY YOU CAN’T STOP PUFFING&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The main ingredient in vapes is nicotine, the same addictive substance found in cigarettes. It is added to satisfy cravings and help smokers switch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both legal and illegal vapes usually contain it, although some liquids are nicotine-free. The difference is illegal versions often carry far higher levels than laws allow – tests have found some packed with up to triple the legal limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The nicotine is usually delivered in one of two forms: ‘freebase’ nicotine, a purer chemical version that produces a harsher throat hit, or nicotine salts, which are smoother and easier to inhale at higher concentrations (legal vapes tend to contain the salts).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A typical cigarette gives a smoker around 1 to 2mg of nicotine. By law, UK-approved vapes are capped at 20mg per millilitre of liquid; roughly 2 per cent strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In practice modern devices are designed to hit like a cigarette, often delivering a similar nicotine hit in a single session pf 10 to 15 puffs, though the exact dose depends on the gadget and how it is used. Nicotine salts allow delivery that is closer to that from cigarettes and so they are likely to be better at helping smokers quit,’ says Peter Hajek, a professor of clinical psychology and Director of the Tobacco Dependence Research Unit at Queen Mary University of London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once inhaled, the nicotine in the e-liquid rapidly enters your bloodstream, causing the body to release adrenaline, which in turn raises your blood pressure, pulse and breathing rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;CONCERNS ABOUT OTHER INGREDIENTS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vapes heat e-liquid, turning it into an aerosol that can be inhaled – as a result ultra-fine particles and dissolved chemicals can reach deep into the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They can stick and slip into cells. The liquid is propylene glycol (PG) and vegetable glycerin (VG), which hold the nicotine and flavourings. Both compounds are used in foods and medicine, but their safety when inhaled is less certain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As Professor Shahab, a leading expert on vaping, explains: ‘PG and VG are considered safe in drink or food form. However, some lab and animal research suggests that VG in particular may affect cell health when inhaled.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lion Shahab, a professor of health psychology at University College London&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For instance, a 2018 lab-based study in Frontiers in Physiology found vegetable glycerin, especially when combined with certain flavourings, can weaken the protective cells that line the lungs and reduce their ability to repair themselves or fight infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vapers inhale an aerosol, but if the heating coil gets too hot – which can happen particularly in ‘dry puff’ conditions, i.e. when there isn’t enough liquid left to heat – PG and VG can break down into chemicals such as formaldehyde (a known carcinogen) and acrolein (a potent irritant).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both can irritate the airways, according to the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment, an official UK expert advisory group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;AND THE ENTICING FLAVOURS...&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The different flavours in vapes come from a wide range of chemicals, many also used in food products, including vanilla, ethyl maltol (sweet) and menthol (mint). But inhaling them is different from swallowing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘In lab and animal studies some flavours, such as vanilla, menthol and cherry-type flavourings, may affect cell viability,’ says Professor Shahab. In other words, cells may work less effectively – for instance in the lungs that can translate into irritation, inflammation and weaker defences against infection. Cinnamon flavour, which contains cinnamaldehyde, and cherry-type flavourings that use benzaldehyde have been repeatedly highlighted in lab studies as among the most irritating and potentially toxic to airway cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, a 2018 study in Scientific Reports found both chemicals damaged lung cells exposed to e-cigarette vapour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Laboratory work has shown cinnamon-flavoured liquids containing cinnamaldehyde suppress the tiny hair-like cilia that clear the airways and also blunt immune cell function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reviews in journals such as Tobacco Control in 2020 have warned a wide range of flavourings can be toxic to airway cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vape packs must include an ingredients list, but flavouring chemicals are usually grouped together simply as ‘flavourings’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The full list is provided to the UK regulator, the MHRA, but not always shown to consumers. The UK bans additives known to be risky such as diacetyl, a buttery-tasting chemical linked with a rare lung condition, bronchiolitis obliterans, or ‘popcorn lung’, named this because it was first seen in staff working in a microwave popcorn factory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘None of the flavourings allowed in UK-regulated vapes is linked with actual disease’ adds Professor Shahab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But studies show diacetyl and other additives still appear in vapes sold in other countries outside of Europe, often without restrictions. It’s also been found in illegal vapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;THE METAL IN THE DEVICE ITSELF&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Red flags for illegal and unsafe vapes are super-strength devices with oversized tanks. They can feature cartoon-style branding, and are sold via social media or market stalls&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have found that metals from the heating coil, including nickel, chromium and lead, can leach into the vapour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2018 study in Environmental Health Perspectives detected these metals in e-cigarette aerosols from popular brands. A 2020 review in Environmental Research confirmed while levels are generally lower than in cigarette smoke, they still raise health concerns over time, adds Professor Shahab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;HOW CAN I TELL IF A VAPE IS ILLEGAL?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Illegal vapes are flooding into the UK: trading standards officers say they are seizing millions of devices each year from corner shops, market stalls and even high street chains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023/24 they confiscated 1.19million illicit vapes, a 59 per cent rise on the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Border Force reported an even sharper rise at entry points, with seizures soaring from less than a million in 2022 to around 4.5million between January and October 2023. A further 1.14million were seized in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Disposables, which fuelled much of the vaping craze, are now banned in Britain as of June 1, 2025. With refillable devices, cost is one clue to whether it’s an illegal product or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Legal vapes also follow strict rules. A legitimate UK product will always be reusable or refillable, with a tank or pod capacity no greater than 2ml. E-liquids must be sold in 10ml bottles, with nicotine content capped at 20mg/ml (2 per cent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Packaging should be child-resistant and tamper-evident, with a batch number and UK contact details on the box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every product must carry a prominent nicotine warning covering 30 per cent of the front and back. Branding should never be cartoonish or designed to appeal to children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exact product will also appear on the MHRA’s public list of notified products, check on gov.uk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is not a stamp of approval in the way a medicine is licensed, but it does mean the device meets strict standards on nicotine strength, tank size, packaging and labelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Red flags for illegal and unsafe vapes are super-strength devices with oversized tanks, with claims of ‘3,000 to 10,000 puffs’, extra-strong liquid such as ‘5 per cent or 50mg’; they might have no warnings, or the warnings are in a foreign language; they can feature cartoon-style branding, and are sold via social media or market stalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Any vape advertised as containing THC, ‘spice’ or other psychoactive substances should be avoided outright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Products may sometimes be sold as containing the black-market drug THC (the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis), but in fact can contain spice, a cheaper synthetic chemical that’s far more unpredictable and harmful than cannabis – and highly addictive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent University of Bath study revealed around one in six vapes confiscated in secondary schools in England tested positive for spice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;HOW THEY COMPARE TO CIGARETTES&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Cigarette smoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals, including over 70 known carcinogens, and is uniquely harmful and kills more than one out of every two lifelong smokers,’ says Professor Shahab. ‘By comparison, e-cigarette vapour is far simpler, mainly consisting of relatively harmless ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘So it is likely the impact of vapes on health is magnitudes of order lower than smoking cigarettes.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine in 2017, led by Professor Shahab, found that people who vaped exclusively for at least six months had dramatically lower levels of toxic and carcinogenic markers than those who smoked cigarettes or used both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some cases, the reduction was as high as 97 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Shabab uses the analogy of smoking as base-jumping and vaping as running: ‘Base-jumping is known to be quite risky, and marathon running can also carry risks but at a much lower rate.’ Vaping should not be a new habit for non-smokers but a stepping stone to quitting for those already addicted to cigarettes, he emphasises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;THE WAYS YOU CAN VAPE SAFELY&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you’re going to vape, choose a refillable product from a reputable UK retailer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nicotine should be used at the lowest strength that still controls cravings, with the aim of tapering down over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Do not use devices to chase a ‘buzz’, suggest experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Avoid unpleasant and possibly harmful ‘dry puffs’ by keeping the tank topped up, and don’t run devices at excessive power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Never mix your own liquids, and never use products that may contain THC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you experience chest pain, tightness, breathlessness or a persistent cough, stop vaping and seek medical advice immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Battery safety is also key: only use the supplied charger, avoid charging overnight, and never carry loose batteries in a pocket with coins or keys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;AND IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING TO QUIT VAPES...&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vast majority of the UK’s 5.5 million vapers are ex-smokers or current smokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while experts generally agree vapes are less harmful than cigarettes, vaping is by no means risk free – potential harms include a risk of collapsed lungs, heart damage and possibly memory loss and leaky gut, while the e-liquids in vapes can contain toxic chemicals, including arsenic, lead and formaldehyde.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So ultimately, experts would prefer it we didn’t smoke or vape at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet quitting vapes can be difficult, as the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-573b6d10-921b-11f0-960c-491e20504623" class=""&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; in the US says: ‘Quitting vaping is likely similar to quitting smoking because both involve nicotine addiction and quitting may lead to withdrawal symptoms.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some vapers may be unknowingly inhaling more nicotine daily than a cigarette smoker with a 20-a-day habit. The amount of nicotine in each draw depends on the vape make but as a general rule, manufacturers advise that ten puffs on your vape are about the same as ten puffs on a cigarette.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Vaping is by no means risk free – potential harms include a risk of collapsed lungs, heart damage and possibly memory loss and leaky gut&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A standard 20mg/ml vape, which allows for 600-800 puffs, with 40mg of nicotine is equivalent to smoking one or two packs of 20 cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And illegal vapes, which are cheaper and unregulated, may contain more nicotine, warns Dr Gareth Nye, a lecturer in biomedical sciences at the University of Salford. ‘Vaping generally is harder to quit simply due to the level of nicotine involved in most products. Most vapes will contain significantly higher levels than traditional cigarettes – as nicotine is the primary addictive agent, this is the problem in quitting.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exacerbating this ‘is the fact that users report higher number of puffs compared with cigarettes and the habits can be tricky to break’, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;(Nicotine-free vapes are available, but these are a very small proportion of the total, according to the government’s Creating a Smokefree Generation consultation.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There may also be psychological issues to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There is the illusion that vaping is safe to continue and therefore people are less likely to stop,’ says Dr Nye. ‘Although vaping is safer, it isn’t without its risks and vaping products are always intended to be stepping stone to being completely free of nicotine products.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He adds NHS resources are focused on smoking cessation but ‘there are a few clinics opening that offer vaping cessation support’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The charity Asthma + Lung UK has recently suggested all stop-smoking schemes should also cover e-cigarettes. So what tools are available now to help you quit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-medium mol-style-bold"&gt;TEXT MESSAGE SUPPORT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regular texts to support your efforts is one approach that’s been proven to work – in teens, at least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When 13 to 17-year-old vapers in the US were enrolled on a text message-based quit-vaping programme, after seven months they were 35 per cent more likely to succeed compared to teenagers who weren’t on the programme, reported the Journal of the American Medical Association last year. Those on the programme received daily ‘timely and compelling messages’, full of tips and advice from real people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, a recent review by the authoritative Cochrane group found that text message programmes may be effective for those aged 13 to 24. ‘The text message interventions were only tested in younger people, but our findings don’t mean that they wouldn’t also be successful in older people,’ says Dr Nicola Lindson, an associate professor at the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are free programmes that offer motivational text messages (e.g. via stopsmokinglondon.com).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-medium mol-style-bold"&gt;VARENICLINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This drug (brand name Champix) works by blocking nicotine receptors in the brain, making smoking and vaping less rewarding and reducing cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the latest Cochrane review, varenicline appeared to double the chances of quitting vaping compared with people receiving no medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s not yet licensed in the UK for vaping, but can be prescribed on private prescription on an off-label basis for reducing nicotine cravings, whatever causes them,’ says pharmacist Sultan Dajani. ‘Common side-effects can include chest discomfort, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, as well as headache and weight gain.’ The usual course is 12 weeks of a twice-daily pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-medium mol-style-bold"&gt;NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY (NRT)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;NRT has long been the go-to method for quitting smoking, but there’s growing evidence that it may help vapers quit, too. It’s available over-the-counter (and on NHS prescription for smoking).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sultan Dajani suggests the mouth sprays are potentially most effective for vapers. ‘They’re easy to use, safe and fast acting – and mimick the habit of taking puffs.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-medium mol-style-bold"&gt;REDUCE THE STRENGTH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cutting down on nicotine vaping gradually ‘can make stopping much easier...it allows the body time to adjust to lower nicotine levels’, according to the National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its suggestions include increasing the time between vaping and lowering the strength of nicotine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sultan Dajani advises: ‘Check your e-liquid’s nicotine content and gradually reduce it over time. If you find yourself vaping more at this lower level, it may be a sign that you’ve reduced your nicotine intake too quickly.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Spacing out puffs can also help. ‘If you vape every 20 minutes, try to extend that to once every 40 minutes instead. Over time, this will reduce your cravings’ he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;Additional reporting by Thea Jourdan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 11:02:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxNT0QtM3JXRHRRN3lvbmwzanV3LWJ1ZThWLXIxbG9qUUFhdDc3RGpPWThMbU5tOEh1ZTVCZy1qWjhBUFVWNGptRW5VMnZqdUFMVUNNLVFwVXpQN1hnNTFGY2dZZnN3eGtDUWtpZWtTeDhXOEw0MGt0VUZPTHRKMXJtSnlVRE53TnhsRVZxVEprTWpGQ1FPZnVyLVVFb19NU05sV1NrZC1IMA</guid></item><item><title>是时候停止食用塑料了。首先，清理这7件充满微塑料的物品- CNET</title><link>https://www.cnet.com/health/its-time-to-stop-eating-plastic-start-by-trashing-these-7-items-full-of-microplastics/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p1"&gt;It's a strange thought, but you're probably consuming tiny bits of plastic with your meals every day. They're called &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/microplastics-are-everywhere-heres-how-to-avoid-them-in-8-common-foods/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;microplastics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and these invisible particles are practically everywhere-in our food, our water, and even the air. For a long time, no one was sure what that meant, but we're now learning this constant exposure might be a real problem for our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;For example, a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03453-1" target="_self"&gt;February 2025 study&lt;/a&gt; found that these plastic bits aren't just passing through our systems. They can actually build up inside our bodies. That discovery has obviously raised serious questions about what this could mean long-term, especially as scientists look into potential links to major health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So where is all this plastic coming from? A huge source is a place you'd least expect: your own kitchen. Between food wrap, containers, and even some cookware, the plastics add up. The good news is, you can lower your exposure with a few easy changes. Let's start by looking at where they're most likely hiding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=cnet.com" target="_self"&gt;Don't miss any of CNET's unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are microplastics harmful?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics have become a serious problem for pollution, and now scientists worry about their potential health effects. An estimated &lt;a href="https://www.ciel.org/breathing-plastic-the-health-impacts-of-invisible-plastics-in-the-air/" target="_self"&gt;22 million micro and nanoplastics&lt;/a&gt; are inhaled by humans each year, and that is largely because they are so hard to avoid. You're exposed to microplastics in &lt;a href="https://hsc.unm.edu/news/2024/08/hsc-newsroom-post-minimizing-microplastics.html" target="_self"&gt;three ways&lt;/a&gt;: inhalation, ingestion or touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822?query=featured_home" target="_self"&gt;have been shown&lt;/a&gt; to cause a number of issues in the human body. Microplastics and nanoplastics found in blood vessels &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/whats-lurking-in-your-body-mayo-researchers-probing-health-risks-of-tiny-plastic-particles/" target="_self"&gt;have been linked&lt;/a&gt; to an increased risk of heart attack, stroke and, in severe cases, even death. Tissue inflammation, cell death and lung and liver impacts &lt;a href="https://magazine.hms.harvard.edu/articles/microplastics-everywhere" target="_self"&gt;have all been noted&lt;/a&gt;. In animals and marine life, they can also cause oxidative and DNA damage, as well as cancer. Mice were shown to have reduced sperm count, ovarian scarring and hereditary metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much is still unknown about the exact effects of microplastics, but studies so far have been sobering. They've inspired many home chefs to reconsider what they use in the kitchen and put in their bodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics are plastic particles smaller than 5 millimeters. Nanoplastics are much smaller and invisible to the naked eye, ranging from 1 to 1,000 nanometers -- a fraction of the width of a human hair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Svetlozar Hristov/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Where microplastics hide in your kitchen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics are more common than you think. These are some places they may be hiding in your kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Nonstick cookware&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study found that plastic and nonstick cookware &lt;a href="https://pml.ac.uk/news/new-study-shows-plastic-and-non-stick-cookware-is/" target="_self"&gt;released microplastics&lt;/a&gt; into food during cooking, heightening one's exposure to these potentially harmful pollutants. Australian researchers &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004896972205392X" target="_self"&gt;estimate&lt;/a&gt; that Teflon-coated cookware contains thousands, maybe millions, of microplastic particles, while a simple crack or fracture in your pan &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004896972205392X" target="_self"&gt;could mean&lt;/a&gt; exposure to over two million microplastic particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Plastic food containers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your Uber delivery could inadvertently be damaging your health, and it has nothing to do with what you order. With the rise of home delivery services, plastic containers are more common than ever, but these containers &lt;a href="https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/2023/11/safer-storage-avoiding-microplastic-concerns-while-managing-holiday" target="_self"&gt;can easily add&lt;/a&gt; microplastics to your food when heated or washed. One study found that all reusable plastic takeout containers typically used by restaurants contain microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Plastic utensils&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic utensils can leach microplastics into your food when exposed to high heat levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Kinga Krzeminska/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies also show that plastic utensils &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016041202400326X" target="_self"&gt;release microplastics&lt;/a&gt; into your food, especially when used with hotter foods. When you ingest the food, you also ingest microplastics that settle into your body and bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Tea bags&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may come as a surprise, but microplastics could be hiding in your tea bags. When you brew tea, the bag is exposed to extremely high temperatures that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10389239/" target="_self"&gt;can release&lt;/a&gt; its microplastics. This comes from polypropylene, a key component in the manufacturing of tea bags. Researchers at Spain's Autonomous University of Barcelona found that billions of microplastic and nanoplastic particles &lt;a href="https://www.uab.cat/web/newsroom/news-detail/-1345830290613.html?detid=1345940427095" target="_self"&gt;are released&lt;/a&gt; from a single tea bag for every millimeter of water it is submerged in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that a single plastic tea bag can release billions of microplastic fragments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Zarina Lukash/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Certain spices&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on how it is packaged, that bottle of paprika could be full of microplastics. Many spices today use plastic packaging, which is concerning because one recent study found microplastics in all plastic containers tested. This can result in food contamination, which &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0269749122019613" target="_self"&gt;has increased&lt;/a&gt; in recent decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Plastic straws&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic straws are especially concerning because &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772416623000992" target="_self"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt; that they release microplastics and nanoplastics, which can then be directly inhaled. Unfortunately, plastic straws are extremely prevalent, with about eight million metric tons of plastic &lt;a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/single-use-plastics-101" target="_self"&gt;found in waterways&lt;/a&gt; each year. Once these straws and other plastics are in the water, they can affect not just the water but also the soil and animals found in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. Canned food linings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;BPA was a controversial &lt;a href="https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/bpa-update-tracking-canned-food-phaseout" target="_self"&gt;material used&lt;/a&gt; in the manufacturing of canned food linings that could cause serious health effects. Today, non-BPA acrylic or polyester epoxies are more commonly used, but these are not proven safe either, as they too contain microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kitchen material swaps to reduce microplastics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, you have alternatives. Before putting on your apron, consider adding these items to your kitchen to lower your risk of exposure to microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Wooden or stainless spatulas&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are alternatives to plastic spatulas. Consider trying out a &lt;a href="https://www.earlywooddesigns.com/products/wooden-kitchen-utensil-set" target="_self"&gt;wooden utensil set&lt;/a&gt; or one made from stainless steel. This can significantly reduce your exposure to microplastics while upgrading your used utensils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Wooden or stainless steel utensils&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of plastic utensils, try to use stainless steel utensils that can be better for the body and also the environment. Wooden utensils can also be a great substitute, working as a more eco-friendly option for your kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Glass or stainless steel food containers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can't do much about how restaurants choose to package their food, but you can avoid using them in the future. At home, try to stick to glass, ceramic and stainless steel containers to skip the microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Loose tea leaves and strainers or infusers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tea bags can be filled with plastic, but a safer alternative could be loose tea leaves. Many companies nowadays offer loose tea leaves that can be used with a stainless steel strainer or infuser, which works the same as a tea bag but can be much healthier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Spices in bulk or glass containers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid potential contamination from your spices, switch to glass or ceramic packaging instead. This allows your spices to remain on your shelf without being infused with potentially harmful microplastics that can seep into your food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reusable metal or bamboo straws&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic straws take a toll on both the environment and your body, causing serious issues for both. A better alternative would be metal or bamboo straws that can be washed and reused. Even paper straws are a better alternative than plastic ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-original c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reusable metal or bamboo straws are great alternatives to plastic ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Luliia Bondar/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fresh produce or frozen produce&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic linings in canned food can hold microplastics, so to eliminate your exposure, look for foods that are packaged in glass instead.

The new cases come as the U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/as-rfk-steers-us-away-from-vaccines-ny-weighs-setting-its-own-policies" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;advocated for policies that reduce access to vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, including the one for measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="bja89"&gt;Still, city health department spokesperson Chantal Gomez said the vaccination rate for measles is so high in New York City that the five boroughs have herd immunity to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7jrk5"&gt;Gomez said the two new cases serve as reminders to parents to get their children vaccinated after they turn 1 year old, despite the shifting federal guidelines under the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="4ri3o"&gt;Local health department data shows that 93% of the city’s 2-year-olds are vaccinated for measles. CDC data shows that the city’s kindergartners are 98% vaccinated against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="di1dc"&gt;CUNY epidemiology professor Denis Nash said the push to get more than 90% of children vaccinated against measles took decades of convincing parents the shots were safe. He said misinformation from the federal government against vaccinations could directly harm New Yorkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="87o10"&gt;“I have great concerns,” said Nash. “This kind of messaging will at best confuse people, at worst mislead them about what they need to be doing, staying up to date with routine vaccines that help protect children, older adults and entire populations from bad outcomes of infections like measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="ei89l"&gt;Kennedy, earlier this year, abruptly fired every member of a top Centers for Disease Control and Prevention committee that decides how vaccines are administered in the U.S., sparking outrage from the nation’s top health experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="2ma96"&gt;New York City last saw a major measles outbreak in 2019, when hundreds of people in Brooklyn's Orthodox Jewish communities caught the disease. The outbreak prompted former Mayor Bill de Blasio to &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/city-declares-public-health-emergency-as-measles-cases-spike-in-ultra-orthodox-neighborhoods" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;declare a public health emergency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dop4l"&gt;Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine said it was important for local officials to inform New Yorkers about the safety of the vaccines while Kennedy and other federal officials under Trump question whether they do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6ei5e"&gt;“I’m really worried about what Robert F Kennedy Jr.’s attack on public health institutions is doing here in New York to confidence in this vaccine,” he said. “There are still pockets of resistance to childhood vaccination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="35d63"&gt;Earlier this month, Gov.

Published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/02698811251360745" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Journal of Psychopharmacology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the research used advanced neuroimaging to compare how these cannabis-derived compounds alter patterns of communication and blood flow in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis contains a wide range of bioactive compounds, but two of its most studied constituents are THC and CBD. THC is primarily responsible for the euphoric high associated with cannabis use and exerts its effects through the cannabinoid type 1 receptor, found throughout the brain. It is also approved for medical use in treating symptoms such as nausea in chemotherapy patients, spasticity in multiple sclerosis, and chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, CBD does not produce a high and has a very different pharmacological profile. It interacts with multiple systems in the body but does not strongly bind to cannabinoid receptors. Instead, it has shown promise as a treatment for conditions like epilepsy, anxiety, and psychosis. A pharmaceutical-grade form of CBD, known as Epidiolex, is already approved for certain seizure disorders. Research also suggests CBD may reduce neuroinflammation and protect brain cells in neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is growing interest in how THC and CBD interact when used together. Products like nabiximols, which contain THC and CBD in roughly equal amounts, are already used to treat multiple sclerosis symptoms. These combination treatments are thought to allow for higher THC doses while limiting unwanted side effects, but the mechanisms behind these interactions remain unclear. The new study sought to shed light on this by examining how THC, CBD, and their combination affect brain connectivity and blood flow using non-invasive imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were interested in directly comparing the effects of the two best-known cannabis constituents: cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),” said study author Diana Cash, an associate professor at King’s College London and director of &lt;a href="https://brain-imaging.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Brain Centre&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CBD, which is non-psychoactive, is often promoted as a treatment for a wide range of issues—from inflammation to stress and insomnia—although the scientific evidence does not always support these claims. THC, on the other hand, is often stigmatized because it is the psychoactive component of cannabis, the one responsible for the ‘high,’ yet it also has recognized therapeutic benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to investigate how these compounds act alone and in combination, as in ‘nabiximols,’ a licensed medication used to treat pain and spasticity in multiple sclerosis. We used rats as an experimental model but applied clinically relevant brain imaging techniques to measure neural connectivity and blood flow. These kinds of controlled studies are difficult to perform in humans due to ethical and practical challenges, such as prior recreational drug use, but of course, animal research also comes with limitations when translating findings to people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used 48 adult male Sprague Dawley rats divided into four groups. Each group received a single dose of either THC, CBD, a THC:CBD combination, or a placebo. The THC dose was 10 milligrams per kilogram, the CBD dose was 150 milligrams per kilogram, and the combination contained both THC and CBD in a ratio similar to that used in nabiximols. About two hours after administration, the rats were scanned using magnetic resonance imaging to assess two key brain functions: resting-state functional connectivity and cerebral blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functional connectivity refers to the level of synchrony in activity across different brain regions. It is measured by analyzing patterns in blood oxygenation over time and provides insight into how different parts of the brain communicate. Cerebral blood flow, on the other hand, is a measure of how much blood is reaching different brain areas, serving as a proxy for neural activity and metabolic demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The imaging data were analyzed using a combination of graph theory and statistical modeling. This allowed the researchers to examine both overall brain-wide changes and effects within specific neural networks. They also analyzed tissue samples to measure the concentrations of THC, CBD, and their metabolites in the brain and plasma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most pronounced effects were seen in the THC group. Rats given THC showed widespread increases in functional connectivity across the brain, especially between cortical regions and between the cortex and the hippocampus and striatum. Graph theory analysis revealed that THC increased both the strength and clustering of connections, suggesting more tightly knit communication within and between brain networks. Cerebral blood flow was also significantly elevated in many regions, including the thalamus, striatum, and cingulate cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rats given CBD, in contrast, showed a general reduction in functional connectivity. This reduction was not localized to a specific area but was more diffuse across the brain. Unlike THC, CBD did not produce any significant changes in cerebral blood flow. These results suggest that CBD may have a dampening or calming effect on neural synchrony, which aligns with its potential use in treating anxiety and seizure disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were somewhat surprised that CBD reduced brain connectivity,” Cash told PsyPost. “However, this is not necessarily a negative outcome—it’s possible that THC-induced hyperconnectivity reflects an overstimulated state, whereas CBD may allow the brain to “reset” or relax. This interpretation is speculative, especially since our work was conducted in rats rather than humans, but it is an intriguing possibility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When THC and CBD were given together, the effects were intermediate. Functional connectivity and cerebral blood flow were both elevated compared to the placebo group, but not to the same degree as with THC alone. Seed-based analyses showed that the combined treatment produced some of the same patterns as THC, such as increased connectivity between the striatum and sensorimotor cortex, but the effects were less robust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the researchers observed that CBD seemed to moderate some of THC’s impact on brain activity. This was evident in both the graph theory metrics and the regional analyses. Increases in connectivity and blood flow were smaller in the combination group than in the THC-only group, even though THC levels in the brain were actually higher in the combination condition. This finding supports the idea that CBD can alter THC’s effects, not just by reducing its absorption or metabolism but by actively influencing brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also used a multivariate statistical approach to identify distinct neural signatures associated with each treatment. This analysis revealed that THC, CBD, and the combination treatment each produced unique patterns across connectivity and blood flow measures. These signatures were consistent enough to differentiate the drug groups and could be useful in future efforts to classify how other cannabis-based compounds affect the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that THC strongly increased both brain connectivity and blood flow, while CBD had no effect on blood flow but significantly reduced connectivity,” Cash explained. “The combination produced an effect somewhat similar to THC, but much weaker—suggesting that CBD can dampen or modulate the effects of THC. This could help explain why traditional cannabis, which contains both compounds, is often reported to produce milder effects compared to newer strains bred for very high THC content.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results are broadly consistent with several previous studies in both animals and humans, though the literature is quite mixed. One striking aspect we noticed is just how heterogeneous the findings in this field are—likely reflecting differences in methods, models, and populations studied.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings offer insight into how cannabis compounds affect brain function, there are limitations to consider. The study was conducted in healthy, anesthetized male rats, which means the results may not fully translate to human users or to individuals with medical conditions. The use of anesthesia, although necessary for high-quality imaging, may interact with cannabinoid signaling and affect brain activity in ways that do not occur in awake brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the study only examined the short-term effects of a single dose. Longer-term studies are needed to understand how repeated use of THC, CBD, or their combination might reshape brain networks over time. There is also a need to study female animals and include disease models to better assess the therapeutic potential of these compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research may build on these findings by incorporating additional brain imaging techniques, testing different doses and delivery methods, or examining how other cannabinoids and non-cannabinoid components of cannabis influence brain activity. The researchers note that they are working toward creating a comprehensive database of brain imaging profiles for different drugs. Such a resource could aid in drug development by linking specific brain signatures to therapeutic or side effect profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The biggest limitation is that our experiments were conducted in animals, and the rats were lightly sedated during imaging to minimize stress,” Cash said. “These factors limit direct generalization to humans. Still, one of our main goals was to establish a framework for comparing the brain effects of different compounds, including synthetic cannabinoids and other psychoactive drugs. In that sense, the study provides a valuable blueprint for future work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are currently extending this work by profiling a range of drugs that affect the brain. Ultimately, we aim to build a database of brain signatures using advanced imaging techniques, combined with AI and machine learning, to support drug discovery and the development of new therapeutics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We would like to emphasize the importance of using comparable brain imaging approaches in both animal and human studies, to make results more directly translatable,” Cash added. “Standardization of imaging analysis methods across research groups would also help the field move forward more effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/02698811251360745" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Acute cannabidiol (CBD), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and their mixture (THC:CBD) exert differential effects on brain activity and blood flow in rats: A translational neuroimaging study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Eilidh MacNicol, Michelle Kokkinou, Maria Elisa Serrano Navacerrada, Donna-Michelle Smith, Jennifer Li, Camilla Simmons, Eugene Kim, Michel Mesquita, Loreto Rojo Gonzalez, Tierney Andrews, Sally Loomis, Royston A Gray, Volker Knappertz, Benjamin J Whalley, Andrew C McCreary, Steven CR Williams, David Virley, and Diana Cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 10:06:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxOanoxTFkyRkJjQS00WVpFcGp3NWhIcFdESGMzSFNBSjk3UXU5X1hGYTJhTE1kSWRocFl5LUVDM3htRWEweTZPY3pCbnNmVDcxblNDVFhVOE84cDhjU3RaOUtxeE9VbldCTEhLRHk4NEZWa3pkOXRDSmlJUERRUjRzVTZWdTZucUlkUEdObHpjQkU4NVVobXFTLTBnSmxrcEdPQjNjSVZibFlVczlNMTZaeXpLcmU</guid></item><item><title>加利福尼亚州表示，它不能再信任华盛顿接种新冠疫苗。一场重大战役迫在眉睫-《洛杉矶时报》</title><link>https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-09-15/california-covid-surge-is-peaking-but-the-battle-over-vaccine-access-is-just-beginning</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-element="story-body" class="ct-rich-text-children font-cms-font-brand-text font-normal text-lg leading-7.75 [&amp;amp;_&amp;gt;p]:text-cms-story-body-color-text clearfix mb-10 md:max-w-170 md:mx-auto" data-subscriber-content&gt; &lt;p&gt;California’s late summer COVID surge is showing signs of peaking, but the state’s war with the Trump administration over vaccines is just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus levels in California’s wastewater remain “&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html" target="_blank"&gt;very high&lt;/a&gt;,” according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as they are in much of the country. But some other COVID-19  indicators are starting to fall in the Golden State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift comes as California state officials and mainstream medical organizations are breaking from the Trump administration’s recent revisions to federal vaccine guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes, made under the leadership of  vaccine-skeptic Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have been so dramatic that a number of medical experts and officials now express little to no confidence in two key agencies within that department — the CDC and Food and Drug Administration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key turning point came in June, when Kennedy &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-06-09/rfk-jr-ousts-entire-cdc-vaccine-advisory-committee"&gt;ousted everyone on the&lt;/a&gt; CDC’s respected Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which issues recommendations on who should receive various types of vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their replacements — some of whom have criticized vaccines and spread misinformation, according to the Associated Press — have led officials and other experts in some states to doubt or dismiss the latest CDC guidance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s immunization committee “is no longer a trusted source for vaccine guidance,” Dr. Matt Willis, the former public health officer for Marin County, &lt;a class="link" href="https://yourlocalepidemiologistca.substack.com/p/measles-death-covid-hospitalizations" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; on the blog Your Local Epidemiologist in California. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, medical and scientific groups were confident in the CDC’s data analysis and trusted the agency’s vaccine guidelines. And so that guidance informed key matters including which vaccines should be covered by insurance, and professional medical societies were aligned on immunization recommendations, according to Dr. Erica Pan, the director of the California Department of Public Health and state health officer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now what we’re seeing is a divergence,” Pan &lt;a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/JfEbRVAvIys?si=xcamtcNPvT-TMlyG&amp;amp;t=107" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; during a webinar Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California is moving away from the CDC’s guidance and toward recommendations issued by medical groups, such as professional organizations of pediatricians, family physicians, obstetricians and gynecologists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ll be aligning our immunization recommendations with trusted national medical professional organizations,” rather than the CDC, Pan said, “given the termination of the vaccine experts with that subject matter expertise.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of local health departments, including from Los Angeles, Orange and San Francisco counties, are endorsing the California Department of Public Health’s vaccine guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Reuters/Ipsos poll &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/just-1-4-americans-believe-100430636.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly90LmNvLw&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALKrBUlF4BDB4HTa-L-cnjgk279exuLAe0t27Sqi9YjUc7W8QlV8sHi9WmZtttthgPp_ZJfKrn90MGtnJciVKP4pLmi7E5JGb66svGPuCQTrsH8lkIpzdxoPM62yJd9iBPIae3eaS8wL6oKjaECYYWEab6VxR-geePp_mny7HAaD" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that just 1 in 4 Americans believe that the recommendations for fewer vaccines from the Trump administration were based on scientific evidence and facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California, Washington, Oregon and Hawaii have also united to establish the West Coast Health Alliance, which is intended to provide science-based immunization guidance. Pan said the alliance isn’t intended to be a competitor to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, but to evaluate guidance from other professional medical groups “to make recommendations for our states and for our insurers.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already, compared with the CDC, the California Department of Public Health has far more expansive recommendations on who should get the now-available updated COVID vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Covid19Vaccines.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;It recommends&lt;/a&gt; that all adults get vaccinated, as the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.aafp.org/news/media-center/statements/aafp-announces-fall-immunization-recommendations-reaffirming-commitment-to-vaccine-safety-and-public-health.html" target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Family Physicians&lt;/a&gt; recently endorsed; that those who are pregnant get vaccinated, as endorsed by the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/08/acog-releases-updated-maternal-immunization-guidance-covid-influenza-rsv" target="_blank"&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt;; and that the youngest children — ages 6 months to 23 months — get vaccinated, as endorsed by the &lt;a class="link" href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32836" target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California and the pediatricians group also recommend all children with underlying health conditions get vaccinated. They also say any child should be able to get the vaccine if their parents wish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA, on the other hand, has approved COVID-19 vaccines only for those ages 65 and older, as well as younger individuals with underlying medical conditions. That means non-senior-age adults may need to either talk with a medical provider before they can get vaccinated or “attest” to a pharmacy that they have an underlying medical condition that makes them eligible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC also recently said that it now has “no guidance” on whether pregnant women should get the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts have noted that the guidance is contradictory, given that the CDC also says people who are at risk of severe illness if they get COVID-19 should get vaccinated — and pregnant women are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some states, pharmacy chains are being forced to ask people to bring in a prescription authorizing them to get the COVID-19 vaccine, at least for another week. As of Friday, CVS said that was the case in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, North Carolina, Oregon, Utah and West Virginia, as well as the District of Columbia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC could be poised to make getting a vaccine even more difficult for some Americans. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is weighing a plan to recommend the COVID-19 vaccine only for those ages 75 and older, and instruct younger people to speak with a healthcare provider before they get the vaccine, the Washington Post &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/12/covid-vaccine-child-death-cdc/" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; Friday. That could mean an additional hurdle for even younger seniors to get the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is expected to meet  Thursday and Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is some indication that vaccine providers are taking an expansive view of who can be inoculated, however. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaiser Permanente unveiled a &lt;a class="link" href="https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/health-wellness/coronavirus-information/vaccine-appointments?kp_shortcut_referrer=kp.org/covidvaccine" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; announcing that its members ages 6 months and older can get the updated COVID vaccine at its facilities at no cost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vaccination remains one of the safest and most effective ways to help protect against severe illness. This includes children and families whose health would be at risk if they got COVID-19,” Kaiser says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On its site for California members, Kaiser said people don’t need to provide additional documentation to get the vaccine, nor do they need an individual prescription. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official CDC &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/underlying-conditions.html" target="_blank"&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of conditions that could justify getting the vaccine is also extensive, including risk factors like being overweight, physically inactive or having ever smoked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Times reporter visiting a large retail pharmacy was also told that a qualifying reason for a person under the age of 65 to get the COVID-19 vaccine was if they had a family member who was at risk of severe illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Californians were subjected to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-09-06/vaccine-chaos-even-some-vulnerable-seniors-cant-get-covid-shots-amid-spiking-cases"&gt;tough&lt;/a&gt; eligibility questions in the first days the shots were available. But Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco infectious diseases expert, said  that everybody he’s talked to recently “seem to have been getting it without problems, which is reassuring to me, because I want to get one, too.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Legislature is also taking action. State lawmakers on Friday &lt;a class="link" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260AB144" target="_blank"&gt;passed&lt;/a&gt; Assembly Bill 144, which would &lt;a class="link" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billAnalysisClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260AB144" target="_blank"&gt;allow&lt;/a&gt; the California Department of Public Health to not just rely on the federal government to outline what kinds of vaccines insurance providers are required to cover, but also take into account guidance from professional medical societies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At a time when misinformation is fueling fear and mistrust, we must safeguard the proven standards that keep families and communities healthy,” California Medical Assn. President Dr. Shannon Udovic-Constant said in a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cmadocs.org/newsroom/news/view/ArticleId/50978/CMA-introduces-legislation-to-safeguard-vaccine-access-in-California" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; supporting the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pan &lt;a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/JfEbRVAvIys?si=SyMOd7Mo91uvJtpG&amp;amp;t=313" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; she expects COVID-19 cases to decline statewide by October. Flu and respiratory syncytial virus are expected to begin ramping up by early October, and the combined respiratory viral season is expected to peak at the end of December and the start of January in California. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the changes to vaccine recommendations this year is &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2023-05-03/us-approves-1st-vaccine-for-rsv-after-decades-of-attempts"&gt;that the RSV vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is now recommended for adults as young as 50 who are at increased risk of severe illness, Pan said. Previously, the recommendation was for adults ages 60 to 74 at increased risk for severe illness. All adults ages 75 and older are also recommended to get the RSV vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another disease to watch out for is pertussis, also known as whooping cough. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who is also a physician, &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/1966252751400341809" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; on social media Thursday that his state is suffering its worst whooping cough outbreak in 35 years, with 368 cases this year, including two infants who died. “Most hospitalized were not up-to-date on vaccines,” Cassidy wrote. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1AFBVV95cUxOU1I2WmdCeFo5QnUybDFmZVhpdE44YmUxbnhwVUU0Z2E1RmY4akV6ZmpLVlNfZTFyZzBtOFJ3dkppZm1lRFBBU3V4Y3lJcGVvV1NJcktqWXY3VXQ3eGhvbkoteWVoajg0bFk0V2o3Sk13WkZJZE42VEFkVUJUZG5KeVFXc0xDZ2RMUWZiamZFNUhUbE5VQ1pDa0xzTXUydDlCUnNYcGZwQURiRDduX0t6TXc3TTVrVUszUzRsanRWczM3eWxxYWx3a2d6aFZmWjZXMkg1Wg</guid></item><item><title>罗奇博士：了解他汀类药物与胆固醇的风险降低-底特律新闻</title><link>https://www.detroitnews.com/story/life/advice/2025/09/15/dr-roach-understanding-the-risk-reduction-of-statins-with-cholesterol/86080015007/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_by"&gt;Dr. Keith Roach&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; A cardiologist recently suggested that I should consider taking a statin because of my "borderline" cholesterol level. So, I took a dive into the details of statin therapy. I learned that although statins are thought to reduce the chance of a cardiovascular event by up to 50%, the actual reduction is very small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I presented this information to the cardiologist and decided to forego statin therapy, which he endorsed. A better understanding of this difference would be very valuable to your readers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— T.G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear T.G.:&lt;/strong&gt; The amount of absolute risk reduction from a statin in a person without known heart disease depends mostly on a person's absolute risk of heart disease. This depends on the person's risk factors such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol level, smoking status, family history, and other risk factors. (When a person already has known heart disease, then the benefits of a statin are so large that this kind of analysis isn't generally done.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The relative risk reduction from a statin depends on the potency and dose of a statin, but a typically used number is about a relative risk reduction of 20%. (A 50% relative risk reduction isn't achievable with the current medication.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I normally go through this analysis with every patient when considering a statin, and it starts with estimating their absolute risk prior to treatment. There are several calculators to give an estimate; I usually use tinyurl.com/PREVENTCalc and adjust it for any risk factors that are not considered by the calculator. (I should add that some people just have difficulty understanding these numbers and simply ask me about my opinion, which is fine, but I prefer to work collegially.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For example, a 75-year-old man who has a cholesterol of 220 mg/dL and an HDL of 45 mg/dL with a blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg (all of which might be considered "borderline"), the calculator gives an estimated absolute risk of 19.4%. This is the risk of this person developing any kind of obstructive heart disease, including a heart attack or death, during the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;With a statin, a reasonable guess would be a drop of about 20% of the absolute risk (19.4% in this case), meaning a drop to 15.5%. The relative risk reduction is 20%, but the absolute risk reduction for this person is 3.9%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;A second example is a 50-year-old woman with the exact same numbers who has an absolute risk of 3.6%. She would get the same 20% reduction, but this is only a 0.72% drop for a new absolute risk of 2.88%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Clinicians and epidemiologists use another number called the "number needed to treat" (NNT), which is a function of the absolute risk reduction. In the examples above, about 26 75-year-old men would need to be treated for 10 years to prevent a case of heart attack or death, while 139 50-year-old women would need to be treated to prevent one case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The benefit of a statin or any other treatment to reduce heart disease depends on how much risk a person has to begin with. Whether this benefit is "worth it" to any given person depends not only on the absolute benefit, but also on their aversion to medicine and their level of worry about heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The cost of a statin ($5 or $10 a month) isn't a big consideration for most. Serious side effects to statins are rare, but if they occur, there are alternatives.&lt;em&gt;Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 09:02:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1gFBVV95cUxOOWdobmFnd016dTRmRE0tUThxRnhqNDRUY3gxYnhBd0lTNFQyTnJISHlKU2xaVkdDV3V0RS1YLV9hRHFZdmExeU9sLThPUjRXb0RSSzdzZ2lWWU1DbEJBMUMxUDFOOGlWcTZzOFJzS1NmUGVjUEwtN1JJZVpuaHVrdDZfWEFKQjhPUEhidkl0QnZlOE13VzZFQ2Z5dTVna21vMmZCOXZXdC0xaFFOSEFCQlN4bWpjU2RZWUNrVHVFcXAxTjJaVFBkZkN3Q2FOeUxuOGZQTUZ3</guid></item><item><title>当简单的游泳会带来危险疾病的风险时--《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/15/health/schistosomiasis-children.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 09:00:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE1KbWFBQTNLX1pldGx2Q3dWa3ZtODhKZTNmQXdZVHUwV1pJcTRlaUM2a05rRkJaZlp3WU1ldXRuYjZTZHJpbkljVExHSHFkNzFkSUZqd1h0RmNFaW5hYXNvSDUtQjhVX0lha3I2SERRMS1uU2RScTdlczJYaw</guid></item><item><title>是镁还是按摩？关于睡眠用镁乳的事实- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2025/09/15/nx-s1-5529375/magnesium-lotion-massage-sleep</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The latest health craze to hit social media: magnesium lotion.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Magnesium is an essential mineral that the body uses for a number of functions. It has long been thought to help with sleep when taken as an oral supplement, though there is &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/08/05/nx-s1-5060416/sleep-magnesium-supplements" target="_blank"&gt;little scientific evidence&lt;/a&gt; to back up that claim. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Influencers now promote magnesium in lotion form as an elixir for improving sleep as well as for addressing a wide range of problems, including cortisol and insulin imbalance, muscle soreness, fibromyalgia and arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Did you know rubbing magnesium cream on your child's feet can help with sleep?" asks one woman on TikTok who goes by cottagecalderon and who promises that it can help with growing pains and improving mood.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"No midnight leg cramps," says a man on the account tap.the.orange.cart. "It works for me and my wife."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Y'all," says another TikTokker, well over 40ish, "this magnesium lotion and spray is magic in the bottle."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The claim &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Enthusiasts claim that magnesium lotion — specifically applied to feet — can improve sleep. Many also argue it can be applied all over the body to remedy a variety of other health ailments.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People are buying the idea, literally. &lt;a href="https://growthmarketreports.com/report/topical-magnesium-creams-market" target="_blank"&gt;One market research group&lt;/a&gt; estimated the market in 2024 for topical magnesium was more than $400 million.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The evidence &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There is little proof that magnesium can be absorbed through the skin.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The problem with this is that the skin is a barrier, not a sponge," says &lt;a href="https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/162855" target="_blank"&gt;Nicholas Theodosakis&lt;/a&gt;, a dermatologist and researcher at Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most medications are best delivered orally, which allows for quick absorption into the bloodstream. A few kinds of substances are well suited to absorption through the skin, he says. Often, transdermal patches are used for medications that need to be slowly absorbed over time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's no evidence that magnesium is in this category.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Theodosakis theorizes that any benefits realized from magnesium lotion are likely from the massage used to apply it or the lotion's moisturizing ingredients. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;" You apply a cream or a lotion or an ointment that contains some active ingredient and, yeah, your skin looks better than maybe some place you didn't apply it," says Theodosakis. "But that's because the cream itself promotes skin health. Anything that comes in like a cream base or an ointment base is just automatically gonna be good for the skin."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The nuance&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of evidence, at least one doctor says if magnesium lotion is working for you — go for it. "I think the risks of applying magnesium to your skin are probably extremely small," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://sleep.hms.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/john-winkelman" target="_blank"&gt;John Winkelman&lt;/a&gt;, a sleep expert at Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says he had at least one patient report using "magnesium butter," for sleep. (" I thought you put that on toast, but no, in fact, you rub it on your legs," says Winkelman.) "She did say magnesium butter was helping."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Winkelman says in matters of sleep especially, placebo can be powerful — and he's not one to discourage whatever safe remedies work for his patients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That said, Winkelman is not planning to recommend it anytime soon. Supplements and related products are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, which leaves consumers vulnerable to buying the lotion without knowing exactly what's in it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For some of the sleep conditions that magnesium lotion supposedly treats, says Winkelman, there are medically proven treatments. Restless legs syndrome, for example — something some influencers say is eased with an application of magnesium lotion — has actual tested medical therapies. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I really don't feel that it's fair to recommend things that I really don't think have been substantiated as effective," says Winkelman. "I'm a big believer in scientific evidence."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Though there is no proof that magnesium lotion promotes sleep or addresses medical problems, experts, including dermatologist Nicholas Theodosakis, agree that magnesium lotion likely won't hurt, except, he says, "in the pocketbook."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;He notes that as a dermatologist, he sees many health fads. "I think it's just the nature of skin," he notes. "It's highly linked to emotional well-being and psychology and culture. Also, you just have quite a lot of it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NPR</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxNaUMycDFmR2NUSXNFNjJjRUxjVUcwNFQtcWhWQ3JJQjZJOUdDRVlPaTRDeHl0UnR6Qm9yQjhWRXdnRkVkNXpYX2VZX2QxODlseGpSTDZteFgwaWl6NUFDMHBxMmRPSzNGYmdhOHdmdXlKbjVOcmxzOW9YVkIwZ3ViNg</guid></item><item><title>特朗普政府残酷解散儿科脑肿瘤联盟- statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/15/pediatric-brain-tumor-consortium-disbanding-funding-trump/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight days before my 12-year-old son Aryeh died from a rare form of brain cancer on March 23, 2023, he slipped into unconsciousness. The following afternoon, my husband and I had a long conversation about end-of-life steps with his dedicated pediatric oncologist at Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem. I almost slipped off my chair from exhaustion. Later, I climbed into bed with my son and napped with him for two hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To our immense surprise, Aryeh woke up that evening after almost 24 hours of unconsciousness. Maybe he was faintly aware of my presence by his side. He lived another week, and during those days he was his inimitable self, chatty and smiley, although he was very weak and sometimes in pain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our last Sabbath together in the hospital was almost peaceful. On Friday night, we made the Sabbath blessing over a cup of grape juice together, and during the day, I read him “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_William_(book_series)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Just William&lt;/a&gt;” stories when he was awake. If I brought him a cup of water, I called it a “goblet” and addressed him as “m’lud,” and he replied, “thank you, milady.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, that “extra” week with Aryeh almost felt like an unexpected gift. In that time, we were able to talk together, laugh, hug each other, and discuss important questions. A medical clown named Zaza &lt;a href="https://momentmag.com/israeli-medical-clowns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;took him to the Jerusalem aquarium&lt;/a&gt; in her “clownbulance.” Our daughter, Aryeh’s twin sister, played foosball with him and with other children in the pediatric department at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think a lot about that “gift” of an extra week of Aryeh’s life, and I think about it now, when I read in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/28/well/pediatric-brain-cancer-trial-group.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the New York Times&lt;/a&gt; that the U.S. federal government is halting $4 million per year in funding to &lt;a href="https://www.pbtc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium&lt;/a&gt; (PBTC), an association of 15 academic centers and children’s hospitals founded in 1999. A &lt;a href="https://dctd.cancer.gov/research/networks/pediatric" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;notice on the website of the National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt; announced that the PBTC, which is dedicated to trials of novel treatments for pediatric brain cancer, will not be able to apply for another five-year funding award to continue its funding beyond March 2026.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;According to the Times, the PBTC currently has six active trials; five are related to treatment. &lt;a href="https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/cancer-biology/john-prensner-md-phd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;John Prensner&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatric neuro-oncologist at the University of Michigan quoted in the story, said that “these are early phase trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of novel therapies for pediatric brain cancers — mostly ‘the very highest-risk types’ of these cancers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My son had been diagnosed with a very rare, malignant, and aggressive type of brain cancer, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-36107-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;APXA&lt;/a&gt; (anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma). From his diagnosis on March 10, 2022, he lived slightly more than a year. During that time, he endured three brain surgeries, multiple bouts of brain and spinal irradiation, several rounds of experimental medication, and numerous hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After each treatment, Aryeh said that he would bounce back: “I always do.” Tragically, no targeted medication exists for this type of tumor, because it is so rare and resistant to standard treatments. And so his ability to “bounce back” ended.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is why early-phase trials conducted by the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium are so crucial for children with rare cancers. The PBTC’s &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2877373/#:~:text=The%20PBTC%20was%20created%20in,Group%20to%20conduct%20definitive%20trials." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; is to “develop and carry out novel phase I, phase II, and pilot trials” of new therapies and “novel treatment delivery technologies,” in children aged up to 21 years with primary tumors of the central nervous system. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Times notes that after two years of rigorous review, a trial was about to begin “for a neurosurgical procedure that would use tiny lasers to deliver heat and destroy tumors in the brain,” led by &lt;a href="https://weillcornell.org/mmsouweidane" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Mark Souweidane&lt;/a&gt;, director of pediatric neurosurgery at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. In speaking to the New York Times, Souweidane decried the loss of the PBTC, in which collaboration between researchers from different disciplines can lead to the cross-fertilization of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because of the disbanding of the PBTC, children with rare brain cancers may be denied the chance to participate in trials of new and promising treatments, such as CAR-T cell therapy, a type of immunotherapy that “&lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/dual-target-car-t-cell-therapy-slows-growth-aggressive-brain-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;shows promise&lt;/a&gt;” for slowing tumor growth in glioblastoma, an aggressive and fast-growing brain cancer. Several patients lived 12 months or longer after receiving the experimental therapy; the median survival rate for recurrent glioblastoma ranges from six to 10 months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2024/11/car-t-brain-cancer.html#:~:text=CAR%2DT%20cells%2C%20or%20chimeric,see%20clear%20evidence%20of%20reversibility.%22" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one clinical trial at Stanford Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, 11 patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, or &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/brain/patient/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;DIPG&lt;/a&gt;, were treated with CAR-T cells. This rare brain cancer, in which malignant cells mix with healthy cells in key neurological structures, cannot be removed with surgery, and no effective chemotherapy options exist. Four of the patients in the Stanford trial saw their tumors shrink by half; one participant, named Drew, saw his tumor disappear from brain scans. Drew is still alive four years after his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/neuro-oncology/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/neuonc/noaf039/8024036?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;amp;login=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a study published in February&lt;/a&gt; led by Souweidane, researchers announced “&lt;a href="https://www.mskcc.org/news/drug-delivery-approach-shows-promise-treating-deadly-brain-tumor-children#:~:text=The%20convection%2Denhanced%20delivery%20system,CED%20for%20DIPG%20in%20Children" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;hopeful&lt;/a&gt;” results from a Phase 1 trial that tested a novel drug delivery technique called &lt;a href="https://braintumorcenter.ucsf.edu/treatment/experimental-diagnostics-therapies/convection-enhanced-delivery" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;convection-enhanced delivery&lt;/a&gt; for DIPG. This method bypasses the blood-brain barrier, which blocks chemotherapy drugs, by directly infusing drugs through a catheter into the brain tumor. Although DIPG typically has a survival rate of eight to 12 months, several children in Souweidane’s trial have lived for &lt;a href="https://www.mskcc.org/news/drug-delivery-approach-shows-promise-treating-deadly-brain-tumor-children#:~:text=The%20convection%2Denhanced%20delivery%20system,CED%20for%20DIPG%20in%20Children" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;more than three years&lt;/a&gt; after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An extra six months, an extra year, a possible lifetime: That’s time that my talented 12-year-old son was denied. In his last months, Aryeh talked enthusiastically about starting middle school with his friends; about his upcoming bar mitzvah, which he began preparing for but didn’t celebrate; and about growing up to become a brain surgeon, “if I get better.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that’s extra time that kids facing similar diagnoses might have had, but probably won’t, thanks to a cruel decision to dismantle the PBTC. The Trump administration, which made the decision, proclaims its “pro-life” bona fides. It does not include children with brain cancer in its bloviated love of life.&lt;/p&gt;

The maker of a high-end protein bar, a company called David Protein, is literally marketing &lt;a href="https://davidprotein.com/products/cod?srsltid=AfmBOoq4qLmSAt8-Lj3Ig29LuXrxoDYy2x8aLz-5CRyRB-Mu47Ew3jTU" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://davidprotein.com/products/cod?srsltid=AfmBOoq4qLmSAt8-Lj3Ig29LuXrxoDYy2x8aLz-5CRyRB-Mu47Ew3jTU"&gt;frozen, raw cod &lt;/a&gt;alongside its blueberry pie and cake batter bars, as if cod were just one more flavor. “Boil before consuming,” the directions read.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The protein craze is fueled by gym culture; a recognition that eating protein makes you feel full longer and can help with weight loss; and the marketers eager to exploit our vulnerabilities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;What was once a niche gym bro obsession is now being inflicted on people who just want to go about their day without being shamed for wasting calories on an apple.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I thought counting calories was a drag, but it’s nothing compared with trying to hit your protein quota. To do protein right, you need to spend your days like a blue whale, eating, eating, eating, except instead of krill, you’re mainlining pistachios and Greek yogurt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;No one’s giddier about protein than the food brands.

However, the solution might be as simple as using special eye drops two or three times a day.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A retrospective study of 766 patients presented on September 14 at the 43&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; Congress of the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (ESCRS) [1], found that the majority could read an extra two, three or more lines on the eye chart used for testing near visual acuity (the Jaeger chart) after using specially formulated eye drops. This improvement was sustained for up to two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Giovanna Benozzi, director of the Center for Advanced Research for Presbyopia, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, said: "We conducted this research due to the significant unmet medical need in presbyopia management. Current solutions such as reading glasses or surgical interventions have limitations, including inconvenience, social discomfort, and potential risks or complications. There is a group of presbyopia patients who have limited options besides spectacles, and who are not candidates for surgery; these are our primary focus of interest. We sought to provide robust clinical evidence supporting an innovative pharmacological solution to offer patients a non-invasive, convenient and effective alternative."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eye drops, developed by Dr Benozzi's father, the late Dr Jorge Benozzi of the same centre, contain a combination of two active agents: pilocarpine, a drug that constricts the pupils and contracts the ciliary muscle, which is a muscle controlling the eye's accommodation for seeing objects at varying distances, and diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces inflammation and the discomfort that pilocarpine often causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients administered the eye drops twice a day, usually on waking and again approximately six hours later, with an optional third dose if symptoms recurred or additional visual comfort was needed. The group of patients (373 women and 393 men, with an average age of 55) were divided into three groups to receive one of three eye drop formulations. Each formulation had a fixed dose of diclofenac but concentrations of pilocarpine were 1%, 2% and 3%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers assessed the improvement in how well patients could read the Jaeger chart without reading glasses (uncorrected near visual acuity) one hour after the first administration of the drops, and they followed up the patients for two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Benozzi told the Congress: "Our most significant result showed rapid and sustained improvements in near vision for all three concentrations. One hour after having the first drops, patients had an average improvement of 3.45 Jaeger lines. The treatment also improved focus at all distances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Impressively, 99% of 148 patients in the 1% pilocarpine group reached optimal near vision and were able to read two or more extra lines. Approximately 83% of all patients maintained good functional near vision at 12 months. Importantly, no significant adverse events like increased intraocular pressure or retinal detachment were observed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2% group, 69% of 248 patients were able to read three or more extra lines on the Jaeger chart, and in the 3% group, 84% of 370 patients could read three or more extra lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The improvement in the patients' vision was sustained for up to two years, with a median duration of 434 days. Adverse side effects were mild, with the most common being temporary dim vision, which occurred in 32% of cases, irritation when the drops were instilled (3.7%) and headache (3.8%). No patients discontinued the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common adverse side effects of pilocarpine can also include eye redness, watery eyes, blurred vision, dim or dark vision, sensitivity to light or problems changing focus between objects, seeing flashes of light or "floaters" in vision, and, in rare cases, detached retinas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Benozzi continued: "Nearly all patients experienced positive improvements in near visual acuity, although the magnitude of the improvement depended on the status of their vision before treatment at baseline. Our study revealed that optimal pilocarpine concentrations could be individualized depending on the baseline severity of presbyopia as assessed by the initial Jaeger scores. Patients with less severe presbyopia responded best to 1% concentrations, while those with more advanced presbyopia required higher 2% or 3% concentrations to achieve significant visual improvement."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She concluded: "These results suggest this combination therapy offers a safe, effective, and well-tolerated alternative to traditional presbyopia management. It significantly reduces dependence on reading glasses, providing a convenient, non-invasive option for patients, although these eye drops may not eliminate the need for glasses in all individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Importantly, this treatment is not intended to replace surgical interventions, but rather to serve as a valuable solution for patients who need safe, effective, and personalised alternatives and seek freedom from the inconvenience of eyewear. Eye care professionals now have an evidence-based pharmacological option that expands the spectrum of presbyopia care beyond glasses and surgery."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the group of patients in this study, Dr Benozzi has other patients who have received the treatment for more than ten years. Dr Benozzi plans further research to measure improvements in patients' quality of life, and to explore the underlying physiological mechanisms of the eye drops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strengths of the study include the large number of patients included and the long follow-up time. It is the first systematic evaluation comparing three different pilocarpine concentrations in combination with diclofenac. A limitation is that it is a retrospective, single-centre study, which could limit the generalizability of the findings and introduce selection bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESCRS President-Elect, Professor Burkhard Dick, chair of the ophthalmology department at the University Eye Hospital Bochum, Germany, was not involved in the research. He commented: "While surgery for age-related near vision loss has advanced, some patients are not candidates. The single-centre retrospective study by Dr Benozzi suggests that eye drops containing pilocarpine and diclofenac may improve near vision for up to two years, but the limited design means the results may not apply to everyone. Long-term pilocarpine use can sometimes cause side effects such as reduced night vision, dimmer vision in low light, eye strain, irritation and, in rare cases, retinal detachment, while prolonged topical NSAID use may pose corneal risks. Broader, long-term, multi-centre studies are needed to confirm safety and effectiveness before this treatment can be widely recommended."&lt;/p&gt;

For me, recovering from a disc injury has meant learning to respect where my body is at right now, rather than jumping straight back into high-intensity cardio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I’ve been looking for more gentle ways to support my cardiovascular health and landed on walking as an ideal low-impact option that still offers significant health benefits, but I’ve struggled to find the time. Many outdoor walking workouts seem to last at least 30 minutes and that simply doesn’t fit into my working day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="360c1b4f-8cfe-4935-b9f7-c05d78203af7-2"&gt;I came across a 16-minute routine that featured seven intervals of brisk walking. To align with the well-established recommendation that everyone should do 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity a week, I increased the intervals to 10 to make a 21-minute workout, which I did daily for seven days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-to-do-the-walking-workout" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-the-walking-workout"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do the walking workout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul id="22f3da81-a148-45a3-b98a-d4d1e4d8cc4d"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Warm-up: 3min leisurely walk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intervals: 1min steady walk followed by 30sec easy walk, repeated 10 times&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool-down: 3min leisurely walk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="c94a087d-29f8-46fe-91df-026a414b5059"&gt;Some walking workouts suggest using heart rate zones to guide your effort. But if, like me, you don’t wear a fitness tracker or smartwatch, then you can use a simple scale of one to 10 to judge how hard you feel you’re working (also known as the rate of perceived exertion):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="ac7d22f5-9538-43a8-9de2-174b75319a38"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leisurely: 1-2 effort out of 10&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Easy: 3-5 effort out of 10&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Steady: 6-7 effort out of 10&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fast: 8-10 effort out of 10&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="83537877-e290-4319-9ad3-a98afc4ef2ca"&gt;For this workout, I kept my warm-up and cool-downs between leisurely and easy effort, I did my brisk walk intervals at the higher end of steady effort and slowed down to an easy effort for the rest periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-my-experience-of-this-workout" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-experience-of-this-workout"&gt;&lt;span&gt;My experience of this workout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a id="elk-7092b1a3-504f-4e2a-b832-5f02364b0455" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="it-s-flexible-enough-for-a-busy-schedule-3"&gt;It’s flexible enough for a busy schedule&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="90b937bf-58ce-4e2e-b32b-770f793aae13"&gt;Committing to 21 minutes of moderate movement a day felt manageable with a busy schedule. But the structure of the workout also meant I could adapt it to suit my weekly schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On days when I had more time, I extended the intervals to two minutes, which made for a 30-minute workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-y7nBXQPJNTU8Sssio3hoUo" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-y7nBXQPJNTU8Sssio3hoUo slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On other days, I did eight intervals but added on seven minutes of continuous brisk walking before the cool-down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had to be more mindful and disciplined with my lunch break to slot in this walk, but surprisingly, I still had time to eat lunch and even complete a quick household chore. It just goes to show, you don’t always need hours in the gym to stay active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-a9f9695c-2158-469e-92f6-97cc45a0dd16" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="i-realised-the-benefit-of-a-work-break-3"&gt;I realised the benefit of a work break &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="30eb3374-537a-4a96-9ad2-50b505d34eff"&gt;It’s easy to power through the day without taking a break outdoors, but committing to daily movement to hit the target of 150 minutes of moderate cardio a week forced me to pause work, lace up my shoes and get outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A change of scenery and a hit of fresh autumnal air energized me and left me feeling far less sluggish. In fact, most days I was even able to dodge the dreaded mid-afternoon slump, which felt great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1346561b-f48b-45da-aa88-1c2da964f6be" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="one-minute-intervals-felt-surprisingly-effective-3"&gt;One-minute intervals felt surprisingly effective&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="d065021f-c5d4-49a5-9fe8-857205b94df1"&gt;Considering I used to complete high-intensity CrossFit workouts, I was skeptical about how effective one-minute walking intervals could be. I don’t wear a fitness watch—preferring to tune into my body—but I noticed that by the last few sets, I was breathing faster and felt noticeably warmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make each interval count, I had to stay focused and push the pace from the start—there was no time for slacking when the work periods were this short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the days I increased the intervals to two minutes, the workout felt most effective because I spent longer at an elevated heart rate, but it still remained a low-impact activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-shop-walking-shoes" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-shop-walking-shoes"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shop walking shoes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="7ca41fc5-2847-4a0b-80a3-4749b9fdd035"&gt;If you need to upgrade your walking shoes, here are the top three picks from &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;’s guide to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/buying-guides/best-shoes-for-walking" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/buying-guides/best-shoes-for-walking"&gt;best walking shoes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="product-container hero-product-container product-block-no-wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="product-block-row"&gt;&lt;div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="534c6823-56c9-4a99-8aa8-5577208cc456" id="534c6823-56c9-4a99-8aa8-5577208cc456"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) &lt;a href="https://www.afro.who.int/countries/democratic-republic-of-congo/news/democratic-republic-congo-declares-ebola-virus-disease-outbreak-kasai-province"&gt;has declared&lt;/a&gt; a new Ebola outbreak in Kasai Province. It’s caused by the most severe strain: Zaire Ebola virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This outbreak &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON580"&gt;began&lt;/a&gt; with a 34-year-old pregnant woman who was admitted to hospital on August 20 and died five days later. Two health workers who treated her also became infected and died. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By September 15, there were &lt;a href="https://www.citizen.digital/news/dr-congo-begins-vaccinating-against-new-ebola-outbreak-n369671"&gt;81 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; and 28 deaths, including &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON580"&gt;four health workers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DRC has had 15 prior Ebola epidemics, with the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-the-drc-ebola-outbreak-was-declared-a-global-emergency-and-why-it-matters-121991"&gt;largest in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ebola/outbreaks/index.html"&gt;most recent&lt;/a&gt; in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But genetic analysis &lt;a href="https://virological.org/t/the-16th-ebola-virus-disease-outbreak-in-bulape-health-zone-kasai-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-a-new-spillover-event-from-an-unknown-reservoir-host/1003"&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt; the outbreak likely began after a spillover from an animal to a human, rather than a continuation of earlier outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How does it spread and what are the symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ebola virus disease was &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ebola-origins-reservoirs-transmission-and-guidelines/ebola-overview-history-origins-and-transmission"&gt;first identified&lt;/a&gt; in 1976 in a village near the Ebola River in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Sudan (now South Sudan).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fruit bats are the natural host of the virus. Humans may become infected &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-disease"&gt;after contact&lt;/a&gt; with animals such as bats, chimpanzees, antelope or porcupines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ebola &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020748914003319?via%3Dihub"&gt;mainly spreads&lt;/a&gt; through direct contact with blood or other body fluids. It can take between two to 21 days for symptoms to appear. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symptoms can be sudden: fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headaches and sore throat start first, then progress to vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, rash, bleeding and shock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without early treatment, the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-disease"&gt;death rate&lt;/a&gt; can reach 50–90%, and depends on the availability of high-quality health care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ebola can spread rapidly within families, health-care facilities and during funerals, where many people gather and the bodies are washed or touched. During the largest recorded epidemic in 2014, more than &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-EVD-SDS-REPORT-2015.1"&gt;800 health workers&lt;/a&gt; were infected and two-thirds died. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nurses and other front-line staff &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-are-nurses-becoming-infected-with-ebola-32873"&gt;can become infected&lt;/a&gt; through close contact with infected patients, needle stick injuries or due to inadequate protective gear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In rare instances, Ebola can “&lt;a href="https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(15)00292-1/fulltext"&gt;reactivate&lt;/a&gt;” in a survivor and trigger new transmission chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why are health authorities worried?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coph.2021.08.002"&gt;largest Ebola epidemic&lt;/a&gt; on record began in Guinea in 2013 and spread into Liberia and Sierra Leone. It infected more than 28,000 people and killed more than 11,000. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of factors contributed to this high death toll: delayed detection, slow international response, weak health systems, rumours and distrust of authorities, and traditional funeral practices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;

            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;The latest outbreak is in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where Ebola was first detected almost 50 years ago. The 2013-16 outbreak occured in West Africa.&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DRC is &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/who-has-declared-mpox-a-global-health-emergency-what-happens-next-236778"&gt;currently managing&lt;/a&gt; multiple outbreaks at once, including a large mpox epidemic, cholera and measles, which also require staff, supplies and attention. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/stories/2025/09/protecting-human-rights-drc-amid-escalating-conflict"&gt;same time&lt;/a&gt;, armed conflict is disrupting transport and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaa163"&gt;limiting access&lt;/a&gt; to certain communities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Kasai Province is fairly remote, the risk of further spread is &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON580"&gt;increased&lt;/a&gt; by the proximity to the provincial capital, Tshikapa city, and the neighbouring country of Angola, where people travel for trade and work.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;But a vaccine adds to the defence this time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This outbreak can be prevented by the Ervebo vaccine (rVSV-ZEBOV), which &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099%2824%2900437-7/fulltext"&gt;showed 100%&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1904387"&gt;effectiveness&lt;/a&gt; in a clinical trial against Zaire Ebola when given immediately after exposure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vaccine was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1904387"&gt;95% effective&lt;/a&gt; if given 12 of more days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real-world &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099%2824%2900437-7/fulltext"&gt;effectiveness&lt;/a&gt; was 84% during the last Ebola outbreak in DRC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) is &lt;a href="https://www.afro.who.int/countries/democratic-republic-of-congo/news/ebola-vaccination-begins-democratic-republic-congo"&gt;supporting vaccination&lt;/a&gt; efforts, sending 400 doses, with more to follow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ring vaccination” of contacts of known cases has started, as well as vaccination of front-line workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="Tweet" data-react-props='{"tweetId":"1963956304277303400"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to vaccination, Ebola outbreaks can be controlled by early isolation of suspected cases, tracing contacts and quarantining them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adequate hospital capacity for infected people is critical. Setting up field hospitals to increase capacity was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6303a1.htm"&gt;key to controlling&lt;/a&gt; the 2014 West African epidemic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, practising &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-disease"&gt;safer funeral rituals&lt;/a&gt; by avoiding traditional practices, such as washing or touching bodies, helps prevent transmission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-disease"&gt;supportive care&lt;/a&gt;, including re-hydration, electrolyte replacement and monoclonal antibody drugs, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/19-08-2022-who-makes-new-recommendations-for-ebola-treatments-----calls-for-improved-access"&gt;can save lives&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet challenges remain. Vaccination campaigns &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/drc-ebola-cases-double-as-virus-spreads-to-villages/"&gt;need cold storage&lt;/a&gt; and safe transport to remote areas. Contact-tracing is difficult in insecure settings. And infection prevention, particularly through protective gear for staff, demands a constant supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Early detection is important&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-source intelligence from news, social media and online reports of unusual disease activity can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230322"&gt;provide early warnings&lt;/a&gt; of disease outbreaks, such as this Ebola outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.epiwatch.org/"&gt;EPIWATCH&lt;/a&gt;, an AI-driven platform, detected a sharp rise in outbreak reports from DRC in early September, coinciding with the case report to the WHO. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/690555/original/file-20250912-56-h39sva.GIF?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;EPIWATCH reports (Ebola, febrile syndromes and haemorrhagic fever) gathered between July 1, 2025 to September 12, 2025.&lt;/span&gt;
              
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were also reports of symptoms in the month leading up to the official confirmation in Kasai. These signals don’t replace lab testing but can give authorities early warning, especially when diagnostic capacity is low. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If contained quickly, this outbreak may remain localised, with limited regional or international impact. The WHO &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON580"&gt;currently assesses&lt;/a&gt; the risk as high for DRC, moderate for the region, and low globally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

Still, he emphasized that for many people, the benefits are likely to outweigh the risks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Turmeric&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turmeric is rich in the active compound curcumin, which has anti-inflammatory and &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cardiologist-calls-matcha-tea-science-in-a-cup-shares-top-5-benefits-fat-burn-antioxidant-weight-loss-caffeine-101752815578622.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="antioxidant"&gt;antioxidant &lt;/a&gt;properties, according to Dr Sood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sood states that the whole body has &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/vitamin-d3-supplements-vegan-options-for-stronger-immunity-and-active-lifestyle-101757418357652.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="vitamin D"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; receptors, including the nervous system. He continues, “Some research suggests that vitamin D may play a role in regulating pain perception and nerve function, improving quality of life in chronic pain patients.” The doctor also mentions that vitamin D can be beneficial for bone health and reducing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Ashwagandha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress and anxiety is believed to aggravate chronic pain. Dr Sood suggests consuming &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/can-ashwagandha-boost-memory-and-thinking-study-unlocks-unknown-potential-of-this-herb-101751090770201.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="ashwagandha"&gt;ashwagandha &lt;/a&gt;to manage anxiety and improve sleep, which helps with recovery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fish oil&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Sood, fish oil is loaded with &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/dermatologist-suggests-6-diet-tips-to-cure-psoriasis-consume-anti-inflammatory-foods-drink-water-101756891986133.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="anti-inflammatory"&gt;anti-inflammatory&lt;/a&gt; properties and research shows that it helps with pain related to arthritis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also Read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/aiims-gastroenterologist-dr-saurabh-sethi-explains-if-eating-undercooked-chicken-can-paralyse-your-body-warning-signs-101757816572456.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="AIIMS trained gastroenterologist explains eating undercooked chicken can paralyse your body: Here's why"&gt;AIIMS trained gastroenterologist explains eating undercooked chicken can paralyse your body: Here's why&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Magnesium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sood recommends taking magnesium to deal with muscle pain and cramping.

			&lt;p&gt;The link between  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="174214" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and dementia is becoming increasingly clear. New research shows how blood sugar problems affect brain health and vice versa. Here are ten evidence-based insights into how the two conditions are related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Diabetes raises the risk of dementia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with diabetes are about &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4722942/"&gt;60% more likely&lt;/a&gt; to develop dementia than those without, and frequent episodes of low blood sugar are linked to a 50% higher chance of cognitive &lt;a href="https://dmsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13098-024-01346-4"&gt;decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Insulin resistance affects the brain too&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insulin resistance – the major cause of type 2 diabetes – happens when cells stop responding properly to insulin. This means that too much sugar, in the form of glucose, is left in the blood, leading to complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-early-signal-of-dementia-could-be-hidden-in-how-we-read-faces"&gt;An Early Signal of Dementia Could Be Hidden in How We Read Faces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It usually affects the liver and muscles, but it also affects the brain.

A brain sugar shortage in dementia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain is only 2% of our body weight, but uses about 20% of the body's energy. In dementia, brain cells appear to lose the ability to use glucose &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7948516/"&gt;properly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mix of poor use of glucose and insulin resistance is sometimes unofficially called &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/dementia-information/dementia-risk/diabetes-and-dementia-risk/"&gt;type 3 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174225" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174225" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Woman-with-Diabetes-Wearing-a-CGM-Device-on-Her-Arm-Reading-a-Book.jpg" alt="Woman with Diabetes Wearing a CGM Device on Her Arm Reading a Book" class="size-full wp-image-174225" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Woman-with-Diabetes-Wearing-a-CGM-Device-on-Her-Arm-Reading-a-Book.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Woman-with-Diabetes-Wearing-a-CGM-Device-on-Her-Arm-Reading-a-Book-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Woman-with-Diabetes-Wearing-a-CGM-Device-on-Her-Arm-Reading-a-Book-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174225" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Frequent episodes of low blood sugar are linked to a 50% higher chance of cognitive decline.

Alzheimer's can raise diabetes risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with Alzheimer's often have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2993007/#abstract1"&gt;higher fasting blood glucose&lt;/a&gt;, even if they don't have diabetes. This is a form of pre-diabetes. Animal studies also show that Alzheimer's-like changes in the brain &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-016-3960-1"&gt;raise blood glucose levels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the highest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's, the &lt;em&gt;APOE4&lt;/em&gt; genetic variant, reduces insulin sensitivity by &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/references/S0896-6273(17)30791-2"&gt;trapping the insulin receptor inside the cell&lt;/a&gt;, where it cannot be switched on properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Blood vessel damage links both conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes damages blood vessels, causing complications in the eyes, kidneys and heart. The brain is also at risk. High or varying blood glucose levels can injure vessels in the brain, reducing blood flow and oxygen delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes can also weaken the brain's protective barrier, letting harmful substances in. This leads to inflammation. Reduced blood flow and brain inflammation are strongly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6571853/"&gt;linked to dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Memantine: a dementia drug born from diabetes research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memantine, used to treat moderate to severe Alzheimer's symptoms, was originally developed as a diabetes medication. It didn't succeed in controlling blood glucose, but researchers later discovered its benefits for &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1517/14656566.2011.558006"&gt;brain function&lt;/a&gt;. This story shows how diabetes research may hold clues for treating brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Metformin might protect the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metformin, the most widely used diabetes drug, does more than just lower blood glucose. It gets into the brain and may &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40710317/"&gt;lower brain inflammation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies suggest that people with diabetes who take metformin are less likely to develop dementia, and those who stop taking it may see their &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2810994"&gt;risk increase again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trials are testing its effects in people &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40434891/"&gt;without diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8. Weight-loss injections may reduce plaque buildup&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs, such as semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy), lower blood glucose and support weight loss. Records show that people with diabetes on these drugs have a lower dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing GLP-1 drugs to metformin, studies have found that they were even &lt;a href="https://drc.bmj.com/content/13/4/e004902"&gt;more effective than metformin&lt;/a&gt; at reducing dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two major trials, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39780249/"&gt;Evoke and Evoke Plus&lt;/a&gt;, are testing oral semaglutide in people with mild cognitive impairment or early mild Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174227" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174227" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Persons-Hands-Preparing-Semaglutide-Ozempic-Injection.jpg" alt="Person's Hands Preparing Semaglutide Injection" class="size-full wp-image-174227" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Persons-Hands-Preparing-Semaglutide-Ozempic-Injection.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Persons-Hands-Preparing-Semaglutide-Ozempic-Injection-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Persons-Hands-Preparing-Semaglutide-Ozempic-Injection-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174227" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;People with diabetes on GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs have a lower dementia risk. (imyskin/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9. Insulin therapy might help the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since insulin resistance in the brain is a problem, researchers have tested insulin sprays given through the nose. This method delivers insulin straight to the brain while reducing effects on blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small studies suggest these sprays &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/1107947"&gt;may help memory&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34101779/"&gt;reduce brain shrinkage&lt;/a&gt;, but delivery methods remain a challenge. Sprays vary in how much insulin reaches the brain, and long-term safety has not yet been proven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;10. SGLT2 inhibitors may lower dementia risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;New evidence suggests that compared to GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, (a type of diabetes drug) are superior at &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1262363625000187"&gt;reducing dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;, including Alzheimer's and vascular dementia, in people with type 2 diabetes. These tablets lower blood sugar by increasing sugar removal in urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study builds on early evidence suggesting they lower dementia risk by &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209805"&gt;reducing inflammation in the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This growing body of evidence suggests that managing diabetes protects more than the heart and kidneys, it also helps preserve brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions remain whether diabetes drugs only reduce the diabetes-associated dementia risk or whether these drugs could also reduce risk in people without diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, diabetes research has been very successful in creating at least 13 different classes of drugs, multiple combination therapies, giving rise to at least 50 different medicines. These reduce blood sugar, improve insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 'side effect' may be better preservation of brain health during ageing.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264393/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Whether you’re catching up on messages, watching videos, reading the news, or just passing the time, the bathroom ritual often doubles as a digital break, as the toilet becomes a mini escape from the world. On the surface, it feels harmless – a few extra minutes here and there. But emerging research suggests this convenience could carry hidden risks to health – especially in the digestive, anal, and pelvic areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in PLOS One by researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston found that adults who use smartphones on the toilet have a 46% higher risk of hemorrhoids than those who don’t. Why? Because using a phone tends to prolong the time spent on the toilet, it increases pressure in the rectal veins. That alone may explain much of the risk. What drives this risk? Mainly, increased time sitting on the toilet (especially more than 5 minutes per visit), more pressure on anal and rectal veins, reduced physical activity, and distraction leading to poor habits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s just one of several problems being connected to this modern bathroom behaviour. From infections to pelvic damage, posture issues to digestive trouble, using your phone during bathroom visits might be doing more harm than you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, we explore seven specific health conditions or risks linked with phone use on the toilet. We discuss what recent studies show, how each condition develops, and simple changes you can make to avoid becoming vulnerable. Even if you don’t bring your phone into the bathroom, some of these risks apply to prolonged sitting. Learning these can help you make smarter choices about when and how to use your phone — especially in your most private moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following are several health conditions that are (or may be) linked to this particular bathroom habit, how the phone-on-toilet behavior contributes, and what you can do to reduce the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 01:12:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>另有十几起案件报告，马歇尔县的退伍军人案件达到52起- WHO13.com</title><link>https://who13.com/news/iowa-news/another-dozen-cases-reported-legionnaires-cases-hit-52-in-marshall-county/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content article-body rich-text "&gt;
		
		


&lt;p&gt;MARSHALL COUNTY, Iowa — A dozen more cases of Legionnaires’ disease have been reported in Marshall County over the past few days, putting the total number at 52. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://who13.com/news/iowa-news/iowa-hhs-investigates-21-legionnaires-disease-cases-1-death-in-marshalltown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Iowa Department of Health and Human Services announced an investigation into a group of 21 Legionnaires’ disease cases,&lt;/a&gt; and one resulting death, on September 4. Over the past &lt;a href="https://who13.com/news/iowa-news/marshall-county-residents-want-answers-after-34-cases-of-legionnaires-disease-confirmed/" data-type="link" data-id="https://who13.com/news/iowa-news/marshall-county-residents-want-answers-after-34-cases-of-legionnaires-disease-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;few weeks, the number of cases has continued to grow. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Friday the &lt;a href="https://who13.com/news/iowa-news/legionnaires-disease-cases-grow-to-40-in-marshall-county-iowa-hhs-says/" data-type="link" data-id="https://who13.com/news/iowa-news/legionnaires-disease-cases-grow-to-40-in-marshall-county-iowa-hhs-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Iowa HHS reported 40 cases of Legionaries’ disease&lt;/a&gt;, by Sunday morning they had raised that number to&lt;a href="https://hhs.iowa.gov/health-prevention/disease-information" data-type="link" data-id="https://hhs.iowa.gov/health-prevention/disease-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; 52 cases.&lt;/a&gt; As of Sunday, there has still only been one reported death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="mobile" data-player-id="4m92we4y" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Legionnaires’ disease is caused by bacteria that spreads through the inhalation of aerosolized water droplets, such as cooling towers and fountains. Health officials say the disease is not contagious and most healthy people who become exposed do not become sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="4m92we4y" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Health officials say individuals with weakened immune systems, chronic respiratory conditions, smokers and those 50 years and older are most likely to experiences severe illness from Legionnaires’ disease. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Common symptoms of Legionnaires’ disease include:&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Muscle aches&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Chest pain&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Headaches&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Gastrointestinal symptoms, like nausea or diarrhea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Iowa HHS, Marshall County Public Health Department, and CDC continue their investigation into the disease cluster.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A vaccine has been approved to help protect koalas against chlamydia, a measure researchers are hailing as a world-first in fighting the disease that is a leading cause of death for the beloved marsupials.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of the Sunshine Coast (UniSC) in Australia said Wednesday it took more than 10 years to develop a single-dose vaccine that does not require a booster that it hopes will aid in "reducing the rapid, devastating spread of this disease."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Some individual colonies are edging closer to local extinction every day, particularly in South East Queensland and New South Wales, where infection rates within populations are often around 50 percent and in some cases can reach as high as 70 percent," Peter Timms, a microbiology professor at the university who led the research team, &lt;a href="https://www.usc.edu.au/about/unisc-news/news-archive/2025/september/world-first-unisc-s-koala-vaccine-approved-to-fight-deadly-disease" target="_blank"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Chlamydia in koalas can cause blindness and lead them to starve to death because they cannot locate trees to climb for food, &lt;a href="https://koalaconservationaustralia.org.au/pages/disease" target="_blank"&gt;according to Koala Conservation Australia&lt;/a&gt;. It can also cause infertility and damage a koala's bladder to the point where the inner wall becomes inflamed and the marsupial passes blood, the organization said. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The disease occurs in koalas multiple ways, including through mating, infected discharges and at birth. Baby koalas, known as joeys, can also catch chlamydia by eating pap, a substance produced by a mother that's similar to feces, if their mother is infected.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Antibiotics have been used to treat the disease but it is not always effective and does not prevent future infections, according to the university. Antibiotics can also lead to gastrointestinal side effects that could hinder koalas' ability to digest eucalyptus leaves, which are the animals' main food source. Depending on the severity of the chlamydia and if it has progressed too far, euthanasia may be an only option.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's why scientists are optimistic about the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sam Phillips, a senior researcher at the UniSC, said the vaccine has been tested on hundreds of wild koalas and koalas in captivity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's based on Chlamydia pecorum's major outer membrane protein (MOMP), and offers three levels of protection – reducing infection, preventing progression to clinical disease and, in some cases, reversing existing symptoms," Phillips said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The study led by Phillips &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-024-00938-5" target="_blank"&gt;that published last year&lt;/a&gt; found that the vaccine reduced signs of chlamydia during a koala's breeding age and decreased death from the disease by 64%.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The university said the vaccine has been approved for production and widespread use by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The agency told NPR it approved a permit authorizing use of the vaccine in koalas in June that runs through June 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

They were heading into deep water and coming back with big, fast fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organic boats and ropes usually rot away, so direct proof is rare. What survives are tools, fish bones, and clues in microscopic wear on stone edges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riczar Fuentes of &lt;a href="https://www.ateneo.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ateneo de Manila University&lt;/a&gt; and his colleagues focus on what stone tools reveal about plant processing and boat work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their approach links tool wear and plant fibers to practical needs like rope, nets, and bindings for watercraft and in a recent publication, they argued that a web of indirect signs can confirm real maritime skill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The identification of boat building materials through direct or indirect evidence is vital in understanding movements across and within island environments,” wrote Fuentes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same stone tools carry tiny traces that point to fiber extraction. Those fibers become cordage, lines, and netting strong enough for boat seams and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/one-third-of-shark-species-face-extinction-despite-fishing-bans/"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; gear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of tracing work has a name. Researchers call it traceology, a method that reads microscopic wear to reconstruct how a tool was used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-seafaring-this-early-matters"&gt;Why seafaring this early matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crossing channels between islands takes planning, timing, and control. Drifting on rafts would not explain repeated arrivals in specific places over long spans of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The region in question is Island Southeast Asia, a sprawl of land and sea that demanded reliable water travel. Within it sits Wallacea, the chain of islands between Asia and Australia that always required open-water crossings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists now think people here were more than lucky passengers on currents. The tool evidence suggests deliberate building, organized labor, and coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of know-how changes how we picture daily life. It also explains how communities kept moving, trading, and adapting across thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hooks-sharks-and-tuna-at-jerimalai"&gt;Hooks, sharks, and tuna at Jerimalai&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Here we report remains of a variety of pelagic and other fish species dating to 42,000 years before the present,” wrote Sue O’Connor from Australian National University, in a &lt;a href="https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstreams/395b3624-7aba-44e8-ae54-08a923e67615/download"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; describing the fish record and early gear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same study documents the earliest known shell fishhooks at Jerimalai, a rock shelter on Timor-Leste’s coast dated between about 23,000 and 16,000 years ago. These are small, precise tools that speak to careful crafting and targeted fishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bone counts are not trivial. The team identified 38,687 fish bones from 2,843 individual fish. Crucially, the assemblage includes remains of pelagic species that live in deeper water beyond reefs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-timor-to-the-philippines"&gt;From Timor to the Philippines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timor-Leste is only part of the picture. A broad record from the Philippines now shows long-term &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ice-age-art-discovery-reveals-15800-year-old-fishing-secrets/"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; that spans at least 30,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352409X23003978"&gt;Work&lt;/a&gt; in Mindoro’s caves adds detail on how coastal people managed reefs and deeper zones. That study tracked which fish families show up, and when, across changing shorelines and habitats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These finds tie into plant fibers and tool wear in the same region. The combined record points to people who planned, built, and fished with skill, not luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patterns like these do not appear once and vanish. They persist, which suggests teaching, apprenticeship, and shared practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-boats-came-together"&gt;How boats came together&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wood planks, sewn edges, and lashings would have relied on sturdy plant fibers. The tool traces match steps needed to strip, twist, and finish those fibers into ropes and lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-61839-w"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that making string is not a recent trick, citing evidence that short fibres fragment from Abri du Maras in France records twisted plant strands more than 40,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This does not mean people in Europe and Southeast Asia did the same thing in the same way. It shows that fiber technology was within the reach of human hands and minds wherever materials allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If people could twist string, they could weave nets, lash boat parts, and make lines. That opens the door to deep-water travel and targeted fishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rethinking-migration-across-islands"&gt;Rethinking migration across islands&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obsidian moving between islands in southeastern Indonesia and Timor-Leste points to sustained contact. The &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305440316301613"&gt;pattern&lt;/a&gt; fits a late Pleistocene to early Holocene interaction zone rather than one-off drifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stone does not sail itself, and it does not walk across channels. Its movement reflects planned trips, return journeys, and social ties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those ties likely included sharing routes and seasons. You do not reach a tuna run by guessing, you reach it by knowledge passed along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As knowledge spreads, technology improves. Better ropes, better lines, and better boats raise the odds of a safe return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-changes-the-story-we-tell"&gt;Why this changes the story we tell&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a long time, scholars looked for the earliest big changes in a few famous regions. These finds push us to broaden the map and timeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, technical skill is not just tool design, it is teamwork. People needed group effort to build, carry, launch, and maintain boats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not teamwork alone, it is also about logistics. Fibers must be harvested, processed, and stored, and repairs must be made fast when seawater and sun wear things down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ancient-fish-bones-reveal-clues-about-the-evolution-of-eating/"&gt;fish bones&lt;/a&gt;, the hooks, and the traces on stone tools point to a culture that understood the sea. The work looks careful, repeatable, and tied to seasons and migrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-remains-to-figure-out"&gt;What remains to figure out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boats do not preserve well, so many details will stay hidden. Even so, the indirect signs add up and form a consistent picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future experiments can test which plants, tools, and fiber twists hold up under load. Those trials can feed back into the archaeological read on use wear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More underwater and coastal work could reveal net weights, sinkers, or preserved cord in unusual conditions. Every new fragment can lock one more piece into place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all of this, one message stands firm. People in Island Southeast Asia were organized and capable on the water far earlier than many assumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352409X25000525?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 23:12:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNQXc3YUU5VVpxSy1nck9id0ZMRmVNM1NoZzZQN0ppRkU5cDRjYlRLSDY1d1BXQ00tNExkU2lVVDlnSjFyYjZ0NDZzak9Ra3JyOFIxWFZEYzhXOWYxSHFYeTZZLVFJQ0FJSGt0SWN5NHZZVUZWdHdKSEJULXZXa0FCV3ZVVkhwbUV5dDN6Z1JTMk9LTDdmQzJmeDhMZkliVlNWd1ZmU2F3SUMtZw</guid></item><item><title>新的研究表明，癌症如何在激素的帮助下欺骗免疫系统- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/cancer-tricks-the-immune-system-with-the-help-of-hormone-scg2/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer sometimes gets the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/daylight-boosts-the-immune-systems-ability-to-fight-infections/"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; to back off. A new study shows that a natural signal, a hormone, can tell certain white blood cells to slow down, which lets tumors grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding points to a fresh target for treatment. It also helps explain why powerful cancer drugs work well for some people but not for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-study-matters"&gt;Why this study matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was co-led by Cheng Cheng “Alec” Zhang, Ph.D., Professor of Physiology at &lt;a href="https://utswmed.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UT Southwestern Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across common cancers like lung, kidney, and melanoma, only about 20 to 30 percent of patients benefit from these drugs called &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s12276-018-0130-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;immune checkpoint inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; – medicines that remove natural brakes on T-cells so those cells attack tumors more strongly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They help many people but not all. That leaves a lot of patients needing new options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many tumors build up cells from a group called &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-021-00670-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;myeloid cells&lt;/a&gt;, early responder white blood cells that usually help start immune defense. These cells can turn suppressive in cancer and hold back T-cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer also changes the immune system beyond the tumor site. That broader shift matters for whether treatments work, a 2021 review explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-study-focuses-on-scg2"&gt;Study focuses on SCG2&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team focused on &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;secretogranin 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(SCG2) which acts like a hormone – a chemical messenger that cells release to send signals through the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They discovered that SCG2 latches onto &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/11006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;LILRB4&lt;/a&gt;, a receptor, which is a docking site on the surface of certain myeloid cells that catches a signal like a hormone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When SCG2 binds LILRB4, it tells those cells to ease off their tumor fighting jobs. It also interferes with the call for backup from T-cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside these cells, the signal turns on &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/stat3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;STAT3&lt;/a&gt;, a protein that switches many genes on or off. When STAT3 is active in myeloid cells, those cells tend to suppress other immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is a one two punch. The early responders stop helping, and the later responders do not get to the tumor in normal numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-tests-were-done"&gt;How the tests were done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers first confirmed the SCG2 to LILRB4 match in dishes of cells. They showed that the binding turned down myeloid cell activity that would otherwise help fight tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then used mice whose myeloid cells carried the human form of LILRB4. Tumors that produced SCG2 grew faster in those mice, while blocking LILRB4 slowed growth, and removing SCG2 also slowed growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also showed that the growth boost from SCG2 depended on T-cells. When T-cells were taken out of the picture, the advantage went away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Myeloid cells are among the first group of immune cells recruited to tumors, but very quickly these tumor-fighting cells turn into tumor-supporting cells. Our study suggests that receptors on these myeloid cells get stimulated by this &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/oxytocin-cuddle-hormone-fosters-love-boosts-memory-and-may-cure-addiction/"&gt;hormone&lt;/a&gt; and end up suppressing the immune system,” said Zhang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-it-could-mean-for-care"&gt;What it could mean for care&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocking LILRB4 could become a new way to help more patients respond to treatment. It makes sense to test LILRB4 blockers with existing checkpoint drugs in careful trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is early support for targeting this receptor from other diseases. In multiple &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/walking-each-day-at-any-speed-lowers-the-risk-of-cancer/"&gt;myeloma&lt;/a&gt;, blocking LILRB4 slowed disease growth in lab and animal tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pathway also leans on STAT3, which is a central control switch in these suppressive cells. A 2025 review notes that STAT3 helps these cells grow and shut down T-cells, so pairing a LILRB4 blocker with a STAT3 focused drug might be useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is another angle too. Because SCG2 can quiet myeloid cells, carefully adding SCG2 might one day help calm certain inflammatory conditions that run too hot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-questions-people-may-ask"&gt;Questions people may ask&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can doctors measure SCG2 in blood or &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/computer-model-can-identify-tumor-fighting-immune-cells/"&gt;tumor&lt;/a&gt; tissue to guide care. That will require tests that are accurate and easy to run in clinics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will blocking LILRB4 cause infections or other issues since the receptor helps keep inflammation in check. Safety will need close monitoring in early trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could tumors switch to a different signal if LILRB4 is blocked. Cancers often adapt, so combinations may be important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would doctors choose who gets a LILRB4 blocker. Matching the drug to tumors that use the SCG2 to LILRB4 route will likely matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-research-goes-next"&gt;Where research goes next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build a reliable test for SCG2 levels and LILRB4 activity. Use it to pick patients who are most likely to benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run trials that add LILRB4 blockers to checkpoint therapy. Track whether more patients respond and how long responses last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Map this pathway in different &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/pfas-forever-chemicals-in-tap-water-linked-to-33-percent-increase-in-cancer-rates/"&gt;cancers&lt;/a&gt; and in human samples over time. Learn when the pathway turns on and how best to shut it off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study whether carefully giving SCG2 can help dial down harmful inflammation in certain diseases. Keep a close eye on side effects while doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-025-02233-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Immunology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 22:52:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxPbTVhX3gxcEVVQ0ZSM3NpWGNjTzRLRDRXWERJM0NLTXdfMFZWam8zZVdKWG1uNTFHUnoxN1BITkJGWWQ0dnRzb3YzNFRPMTFjUFVmNzZLZGdSZllISnZScGZqeWJuMHptUmVpOHA3TjNqYVNtTVd0NG1sWTZnMThDTGw0elcyTms5Q2gwd1hsUDF4UlE</guid></item><item><title>妈妈的深夜谷歌搜索在被误诊为流感后挽救了儿子的生命-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15098125/texas-mom-witten-daniel-flu-cavernoma.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A higher weekly dose of semaglutide (7.2 mg) can significantly improve weight loss and related health outcomes in adults living with obesity, including those with type 2 diabetes (T2D), according to the results of two large-scale, international phase 3 clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet Diabetes &amp;amp; Endocrinology&lt;/i&gt; journal, suggest that a higher dose of semaglutide offers a promising new option for people with obesity, including those with T2D, who have not achieved sufficient weight loss with existing treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The STEP UP and STEP UP T2D &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+trials/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; are the first to investigate whether increasing the dose of semaglutide from the currently approved dose of 2.4 mg to 7.2 mg is safe and leads to additional weight reduction. Trial participants were randomized to receive either the higher 7.2 mg dose of semaglutide, the currently approved 2.4 mg dose, or placebo over 72 weeks. All participants—regardless of treatment group—received lifestyle interventions such as dietary counseling and increased physical activity recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In adults without diabetes, a 7.2 mg dose of semaglutide led to an average weight loss of nearly 19%, surpassing the 16% loss seen with 2.4 mg and 4% with placebo. Nearly half of the participants on the higher dose lost 20% or more of their &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/body+weight/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;body weight&lt;/a&gt;, with about one-third losing at least 25%. Participants also experienced improvements in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/waist+circumference/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;waist circumference&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+pressure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, blood sugar, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cholesterol+levels/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;, all key factors in reducing obesity-related health risks.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Similarly, in adults with obesity and T2D, the 7.2 mg dose resulted in an average 13% weight loss compared to 10% with 2.4 mg and 3.9% with placebo, along with significant reductions in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+sugar/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; levels and waist size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both trials reported that the higher dose of semaglutide was safe and generally well tolerated. Gastrointestinal side effects like nausea and diarrhea, and some sensory symptoms like tingling, were the most common. However, most side effects were manageable, resolved over time, and did not lead to participants dropping out of the trial. No increase in serious adverse events or severe hypoglycemia was observed with the higher dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By delivering greater weight reduction and metabolic benefits while maintaining a favorable safety profile, the authors say this higher dose could help more people reach their health goals and reduce the burden of obesity-related complications worldwide. However, they highlight that further research is needed to fully understand the long-term benefits and risks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis use is linked to an almost quadrupling in the risk of developing diabetes, according to an analysis of real-world data from over 4 million adults, being presented at the Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (&lt;a href="https://www.easd.org/annual-meeting/easd-2025/" target="_blank"&gt;EASD&lt;/a&gt;) held in Vienna, Austria (15–19 Sept).&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Cannabis use is increasing globally with an estimated 219 million users (4.3% of the global adult population) in 2021, but its long-term metabolic effects remain unknown. While some studies have suggested potential anti-inflammatory or weight management properties, others have raised concerns regarding glucose metabolism and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/insulin+resistance/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, and the magnitude of the risk of developing diabetes hasn't been clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To strengthen the evidence base, Dr. Ibrahim Kamel from the Boston Medical Center, Massachusetts, U.S. and colleagues analyzed &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/electronic+health+records/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;electronic health records&lt;/a&gt; from 54 health care organizations (TriNetX Research Network, with centers from across U.S. and Europe) to identify 96,795 outpatients (aged between 18 and 50 years, 52.5% female) with cannabis-related diagnoses (ranging from occasional use to dependence, including cases of intoxication and withdrawal) between 2010 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were matched with 4,160,998 healthy individuals (with no record of substance use or major chronic conditions) based on age, sex, and underlying illnesses at the start of the study, and followed for five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After controlling HDL and LDL cholesterol, uncontrolled high blood pressure, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, cocaine use, alcohol use and several other lifestyle risk factors, the researchers found that new cases of diabetes were significantly higher in the cannabis group (1,937; 2.2%) compared to the healthy group (518; 0.6%), with statistical analysis showing cannabis users at nearly four times the risk of developing diabetes compared to non-users.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;While the authors note that more research is needed to fully explain the association between cannabis and diabetes, it may come down to insulin resistance and unhealthy dietary behaviors. Nevertheless, the study's results have immediate implications for metabolic monitoring practices and public health messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As cannabis becomes more widely available and socially accepted and legalized in various jurisdictions, it is essential to understand its potential health risks," said lead author Dr. Kamel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These new sights from reliable real-world evidence highlight the importance of integrating diabetes risk awareness into substance use disorder treatment and counseling, as well as the need for health care professionals to routinely talk to patients about &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cannabis+use/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cannabis use&lt;/a&gt; so that they can understand their overall diabetes risk and potential need for metabolic monitoring."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors note that more research is needed on the long-term endocrine effects of cannabis use and whether diabetes risks are limited to inhaled products or other forms of cannabis such as edibles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the important findings, this is a retrospective study and cannot prove that cannabis use causes &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/diabetes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and the authors cannot rule out the possibility that other unmeasured factors may have influenced the results despite efforts to reduce confounding bias via propensity score matching. This study has limitations due to a lack of detailed cannabis consumption data and potential misclassification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors acknowledge that the inherent limitations of real-world data often result from inconsistent patient reporting in electronic medical records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also note that there is a risk of bias because of imprecise measures of cannabis exposure and the reliance on participants to accurately report any cannabis use, even when they lived in places where the drug is illegal.&lt;/p&gt;

With that, it’s understandable to wonder about when to get your flu shot—especially since big-name pharmacy chains like CVS and Walgreens are already posting signs about getting the annual vaccine. But is it too early for a flu shot? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="3" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Infectious disease doctors say it’s possible to get your flu shot &lt;em data-node-id="3.1"&gt;too early&lt;/em&gt;, and making this move could raise your risk of being vulnerable to the flu before influenza season is over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;During last year’s flu season, there were at least 35 million illnesses, 400,000 hospitalizations, and 25,000 deaths from the flu, according to estimates from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" data-node-id="4.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC).

However, some seasons are longer than others, and there can be higher levels of the flu circulating as late as May. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-it-too-early-for-a-flu-shot" data-node-id="11" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="11.0"&gt;Is it too early for a flu shot?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Doctors generally agree that right now is too early for a flu shot. “The concern is that the protection will wane,” says &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="William Schaffner, M.D.," data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;William Schaffner, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. “If you can wait a bit, that’s better.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Infectious disease expert &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3528/amesh-adalja" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3528/amesh-adalja" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., " data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., &lt;/a&gt;senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, agrees. “The influenza season can last into mid-spring,” he points out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The only people who may benefit from getting vaccinated now are children under the age of 8 who have never had a flu shot, Dr. Schaffner says. “They will need two doses, spaced apart, so you can get it now and then later,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-my-flu-vaccine-options" data-node-id="15" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.0"&gt;What are my flu vaccine options?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;You have a few choices when it comes to getting vaccinated against the flu. Most Americans under the age of 65 who get the flu shot will get a trivalent vaccine, which targets three strains of the flu, per the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/keyfacts.htm" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/keyfacts.htm" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="CDC" data-node-id="16.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. However, it’s recommended that adults 65 and up get a quadrivalent flu vaccine, which targets four strains of the flu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;There are variations within those types of vaccines, including flu shots that are egg-free, if you prefer one of those. You also have the option of getting a nasal flu vaccine called FluMist, which is sprayed into your nose, bypassing the needle altogether. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="when-is-the-best-time-to-get-a-flu-shot" data-node-id="18" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="18.0"&gt;When is the best time to get a flu shot?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s hard to figure out an exact time to get your shot. However, the CDC usually &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2022-2023/flu-vaccination-recommendations-adopted.htm" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2022-2023/flu-vaccination-recommendations-adopted.htm" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="recommends" data-node-id="19.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; getting your shot by Halloween, aka the end of October. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“October is when I recommend getting the vaccine as there is more actual influenza activity then—there is very little now,” Dr. Adalja says. “The vaccine will last further into the season if administered in October.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Also worth considering: It takes about two weeks after you’re vaccinated for your body to develop antibodies against the flu, per the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/keyfacts.htm" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/keyfacts.htm" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="CDC" data-node-id="21.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. So, if you have a big indoor event coming up sometime in late October or November, you may want to plan to get your flu vaccine a few weeks ahead of that, just to be safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But if now is the only time you can get vaccinated, Dr. Adalja says it’s better than nothing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-long-does-flu-shot-protection-last" data-node-id="23" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="23.0"&gt;How long does flu shot protection last?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s hard to put an exact number on how long protection from your flu shot will last. Everyone has different factors that influence this, including your own immune system, Dr. Schaffner says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But there is a general range you can expect. “The flu vaccine typically provides protection for about six to eight months,” says &lt;a href="https://nursing.buffalo.edu/additional-info/faculty-and-staff/faculty_directory.host.html/content/shared/nursing/faculty-and-staff-directory/faculty/full-time-faculty-profiles/haas-melinda.detail.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://nursing.buffalo.edu/additional-info/faculty-and-staff/faculty_directory.host.html/content/shared/nursing/faculty-and-staff-directory/faculty/full-time-faculty-profiles/haas-melinda.detail.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Melinda Haas, D.N.P" data-node-id="25.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Melinda Haas, D.N.P&lt;/a&gt;., clinical assistant professor at the University at Buffalo School of Nursing. “However, it’s important to note that this can vary depending on individual factors and the specific strains of the flu virus in a given season.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Overall, doctors stress the importance of getting your flu vaccine. “Flu vaccination is best thought of as a way of increasing your resilience to respiratory virus season,” Dr. Adalja says. “It is an important tool to help you avoid the disruptive and serious consequences of influenza infection.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 20:15:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE5qOGc2SmQ5YXE4WTZFT2h2ZFpqbFpSTGRRTnlkYnhXUVBiRy0yQ2RQTkowdmx3RDJlM0pocWhuZ2tyWjZpUHQxTEZmUmFRNkl0ZWhVbE15dG1EbURkUlVIbGo2bllsRm5LNDhIZkZZV1R2NTNOOFE</guid></item><item><title>埃博拉疫苗接种在刚果南部开始- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/world/africa/ebola-vaccination-begins-southern-congo-rcna231173</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-43e172" class="body-graf"&gt;LAGOS, Nigeria — Vaccination for those exposed to the Ebola virus and front-line health workers has begun in southern Kasai province, the World Health Organization said Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b4a394" class="body-graf"&gt;An outbreak of the highly contagious disease &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/congo-ebola-outbreak-a42c28f0c8c1a4d8cecca5072b392593"&gt;was announced&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month in the locality of Bulape, in Kasai, and has left at least 16 dead and 68 suspected cases, according to last week’s briefing by the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-62294c" class="body-graf"&gt;Only an initial 400 doses of the Ervebo vaccine have been dispatched, with the rest to be delivered later, the WHO said.

			&lt;p&gt;A new longitudinal study by an international team of researchers has found a link between eating breakfast later in the day and a greater chance of an early death among elderly people, raising questions about the relationship between mealtimes and illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not just the food we eat that affects our body's health and well-being; the time we eat our meals is also known to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.039373"&gt;affect our body's functioning&lt;/a&gt;. Yet our body's condition can also determine when we may be craving a bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from 2,945 adults living in Newcastle and Manchester, UK, were collected between 1983 and 2017. The participants were aged between 42 and 94 when they signed up, and information was collected through optional questionnaires on their health, lifestyle, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-eggs-can-actually-lower-bad-cholesterol-new-study-says"&gt;eating habits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/switching-off-one-crucial-protein-appears-to-reverse-brain-aging-in-mice"&gt;Switching Off One Crucial Protein Appears to Reverse Brain Aging in Mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statistics revealed the volunteers tended to eat breakfast and dinner later in the day as they aged, extending their daily eating over a smaller window of time, too. These later eating times were linked to poorer physical and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-2-key-lifestyle-changes-can-treat-mild-depression-as-well-as-therapy"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to all-cause mortality – the likelihood of dying for any reason – the researchers found a significant link between eating breakfast later and a higher mortality risk. For each hour later that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/kids-who-eat-breakfast-every-day-share-something-in-common"&gt;breakfast was taken&lt;/a&gt;, the chance of dying during the study period went up 8-11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our research suggests that changes in when older adults eat, especially the timing of breakfast, could serve as an easy-to-monitor marker of their overall health status," &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/meal-timing-in-older-adults-health-and-longevity"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; nutrition scientist Hassan Dashti, from Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173208" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173208" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/EatingChart.jpg" alt="Eating chart" class="wp-image-173208 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/EatingChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/EatingChart-582x415.jpg 582w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/EatingChart-600x428.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173208" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers tracked eating times as people got older. (Dashti et al., &lt;em&gt;Commun. Med.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers aren't saying that eating breakfast later is going to cause you to die at an earlier age – or that shifting your breakfast time forward a few hours will guarantee you get &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lifespan-is-shaped-more-by-your-choices-than-your-genes-study-finds"&gt;an extra few years&lt;/a&gt; added on at the end of your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, they suggest the relationship is likely to be driven in the other direction. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/can-vitamin-d-slow-aging-a-new-study-says-yes-but-theres-a-catch"&gt;As we get older&lt;/a&gt; and a greater number of health problems mount up, and increase in severity, that means an earlier death is more likely, and also causes later breakfast times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poorer health leading to a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-night-of-poor-sleep-can-change-how-your-brain-sees-food"&gt;lack of sleep&lt;/a&gt; is one way that might play out, with trouble sleeping leading to difficulty getting up. Deteriorating physical health also means most tasks – including making breakfast – take longer too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Up until now, we had a limited insight into how the timing of meals evolves later in life and how this shift relates to overall health and longevity," &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/meal-timing-in-older-adults-health-and-longevity"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Dashti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings help fill that gap by showing that later meal timing, especially delayed breakfast, is tied to both health challenges and increased mortality risk in older adults."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way the study findings might be useful is in identifying older people who are more at risk in terms of their health. It also gives us a greater understanding of how &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-intermittent-fasting-has-2-key-benefits-for-people-with-obesity"&gt;changes in eating habits&lt;/a&gt; might affect younger people and older people differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's population &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/heat-waves-can-accelerate-aging-as-much-as-smoking-or-drinking-study-shows"&gt;is aging overall&lt;/a&gt; – meaning a larger proportion of the total number of people on the planet are older – which makes it increasingly important to spot and interpret these kinds of patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Patients and clinicians can possibly use shifts in mealtime routines as an early warning sign to look into underlying physical and mental health issues," &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/meal-timing-in-older-adults-health-and-longevity"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Dashti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Also, encouraging older adults in having consistent meal schedules could become part of broader strategies to promoting healthy aging and longevity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43856-025-01035-x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Communications Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The improvement was sustained for two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The treatment could provide a safe and effective alternative for patients who “seek freedom from the inconvenience” of wearing glasses or who are unable or unwilling to access surgery, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The drops contain pilocarpine, a drug that constricts the pupils and contracts the muscle that controls the shape of the eye’s lens to enable focus on objects at different distances, and diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study involved 766 people in Argentina who used the drops twice a day, upon waking and about six hours later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They were divided into three groups, receiving different formulations. Each of the drops had a fixed dose of diclofenac, but the concentration of pilocarpine varied between 1%, 2% and 3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the 148 given the 1% drops, almost all were able to read two or more extra lines on the chart. In the 2% group, 69% of the 248 patients were able to read three or more extra lines, and in the 3% group, 84% of the 370 patients could read three or more extra lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Giovanna Benozzi, the director of the Centre for Advanced Research for Presbyopia in Buenos Aires, said: “Our most significant result showed rapid and sustained improvements in near vision for all three concentrations. One hour after having the first drops, patients had an average improvement of 3.45 Jaeger lines [the measurement used for testing near visual acuity]. The treatment also improved focus at all distances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Impressively, 99% of 148 patients in the 1% pilocarpine group reached optimal near vision and were able to read two or more extra lines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The findings suggest the therapy “offers a safe, effective and well-tolerated alternative to traditional presbyopia management”, Benozzi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Common side-effects were temporary dim vision, irritation when the drops were administered, and headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts welcomed the findings and called for more research. Prof Burkhard Dick, the president-elect of ESCRS, said: “Broader, long-term, multi-centre studies are needed to confirm safety and effectiveness before this treatment can be widely recommended.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 18:28:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOTzg2amhVYjUycFlPOVpLWEk5NW1WZHpHMGp5cWlJWm55bXVUSXJwVW5lNnhhTkV0bFgxWW9xQm15Qk5EbFI4SW50N1FvUlJoRGNBTUxYbUQwdG9RQXkxbDhVUDh2eVdzZU12ZTIxTlZJSUViZEJfMTBYUHVtZFB5NENrdlZJNFZ6aUQzOE5nV25kTFFySGg3WjdrOUV0WklDcE1hZUppOTg</guid></item><item><title>对RFK Jr.疫苗小组迫在眉睫的儿童注射决定的担忧- Politico</title><link>https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/14/rfk-jr-s-vaccine-panel-to-consider-major-changes-to-childhood-shots-00563165</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Politico</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQdlZXOXpSNktNcXU1cnhDNURmeFBHaElwRF8tWWhaS3ZXOXNIOC12LUJrRy0xazRaTTN4UDNZY2tueW5sd3BZMnluNW0wb1NiWjBkNk1Ybm5LNU5kbkl2b0wySUVIYkxHNS1IOHVMVTVldEh5Y3N2cENSRF9HcnJFUEpRMWNyTjFUb0k4dzI5M09BOHZRSGxKQXlKQnBoSDA5c3drMDdVYTZYOUs4NGRteGl6UjNBVHJH</guid></item><item><title>CDC授予RPI疫苗自闭症研究合同-时代联盟</title><link>https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/cdc-contract-vaccine-autism-research-rpi-21047511.php</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;TROY — The U.S. government may tap researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to investigate if there are links between vaccines and the prevalence of autism — a relationship that vaccine skeptics have long championed without evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which operates within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, intends to award the Troy institution a bid-free contract to take on such research, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-cdc-award-research-contract-vaccines-autism-2025-09-12/" data-link="native" class=""&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/12/cdc-autism-research-contract-vaccines" data-link="native" class=""&gt;Axios&lt;/a&gt; first reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;RPI has a “unique ability to link children to maternal cohorts using proprietary databases and de-identified data sets, enabling advanced statistical analyses within the project’s timeframe,” read &lt;a href="https://sam.gov/workspace/contract/opp/280398e7b4b54c0fac7de5efcbb80a80/view" data-link="native" class=""&gt;a notice of intent on the System for Award Management’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Ingraham, a spokesman for the college, said in a statement to the Times Union that RPI acknowledges and appreciates CDC’s intention to award the contract to the school.

Kennedy Jr., who was appointed by President Donald Trump and confirmed by Congress in February to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Prior to becoming health secretary, Kennedy rejected scientific research that vaccines don’t cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/claiming-autism-epidemic-rfk-jr-describes-nih-initiative-find-environmental-causes" data-link="native" class=""&gt;claimed autism was a burgeoning “epidemic”&lt;/a&gt; that could be caused by environmental factors and announced plans to find the root cause of the disorder by September. Around the same time of his announcement, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/ss/ss7402a1.htm" data-link="native" class=""&gt;the CDC released a report&lt;/a&gt; that suggested the rise of autism prevalence in children was due to increased awareness of the condition and improved methods of diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the final weeks of the Biden administration in 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/autism.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;the CDC noted on its website&lt;/a&gt; that “no links have been found between any vaccine ingredients and (Autism Spectrum Disorder).” The page includes further information about CDC studies and work by other research institutions that have investigated vaccine safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a developing story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times Union</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 17:12:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxQNi05NHVmQ0ZNOGNWcUp1ZlJzdlJSX09WdDRaT2pIbHVIWEhGN2pFMkhEc1g1YjQ0VllPbVlWTERMTXpkS0ttT0lXcm84Ny1zZXJkdDQ5MjhLZlptS0ZGcUF3S2hzR2k2VnJ1RTNQV29wSnJ2UFJDVjJMellFM3BwX3VKNzA1cUdpTFJUQlFwLWNSNFNDM3JmLQ</guid></item><item><title>传染病更新2025年9月14日-每日科斯</title><link>https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/9/14/2339914/-Infectious-Updates-9-14-2025</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story__text"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;DR Congo &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/ebola/dr-congo-declares-ebola-outbreak-kasai-province" target="_blank"&gt;declares another Ebola outbreak.&lt;/a&gt;  More &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/ebola/who-shares-more-dr-congo-ebola-outbreak-details-more-suspected-cases-reported" target="_blank"&gt;details emerge.&lt;/a&gt;  Suspected cases &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/ebola/suspected-cases-dr-congo-ebola-outbreak-rise-68" target="_blank"&gt;have risen to 68,&lt;/a&gt;  and more regions are involved.  This is a new zoonotic spillover, not related to previous outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mpox &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/mpox/hot-spots-shift-africa-s-mpox-battle-cholera-activity-spikes-chad-and-republic-congo" target="_blank"&gt;Continues to be a problem for Africa&lt;/a&gt;, as the rest of the world winds down its health emergency.  Also, cholera is a severe problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A previously stored sample from a CA dairy herd &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/earlier-h5n1-detection-adds-texas-dairy-herd-total-researchers-cant" target="_blank"&gt;tested positive for H5N1,&lt;/a&gt; but no new detections have occurred in cattle in the last 30 days.  A turkey farm has been hit, the second recent detection in South Dakota.  Avian flu &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/cdc-says-avian-flu-may-infect-gut-though-risk-low" target="_blank"&gt;may infect the gut, though the risk is considered low.&lt;/a&gt;  Seems clear to me that pets infected by raw foods got it that way, not by breathing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In related developments, a multisector group made up of experts in poultry, public health, science, and policy is meeting for the first time this week in Brazil to address the escalating avian flu threat to animal health, human health, and livelihoods, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/avian-influenza--first-global-dialogue-targets-the-rising-pandemic-threat/en" target="_blank"&gt;said today&lt;/a&gt;. The group called the response unprecedented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avian flu is now a global challenge, not a sporadic threat, Beth Bechdol, MS, the FAO's deputy director-general, said in a statement, "No single country or sector can tackle this threat in isolation—and failure is not an option. Practical, science-based collaboration like this is essential to protect our agrifood systems, livelihoods, and public health."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the OTHER bird flus is still causing human cases &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/four-more-h9n2-avian-flu-cases-confirmed-china" target="_blank"&gt;In China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was measles exposure &lt;a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2025/09/09/repub/utah-health-officials-warn-of-measles-exposure-at-large-cycling-event/?emci=19ddf5c1-ca8d-f011-b484-6045bdeb7413&amp;amp;emdi=86e572af-3d8e-f011-b484-6045bdeb7413&amp;amp;ceid=491687" target="_blank"&gt;At a large cycling event in Utah.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sad reminder that measles can kill years later: an LA child &lt;a href="http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/la-county-confirms-childs-death-late-measles-complication" target="_blank"&gt;Who caught measles as an infant&lt;/a&gt; has died of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a rare and fatal sequel of measles that occurs 10 or more years after the original infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States are stepping up &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/minnesota-new-york-issue-executive-orders-promoting-access-covid-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;To secure vaccine access for their citizens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salmonella in delivered meals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has posted a notice about a&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Salmonella&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Enteritidis outbreak linked to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/outbreaks/homedeliverymeals-09-25/investigation.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;meals from Metabolic Meals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a home delivery company. So far, at least 16 people in 10 states have been sickened, with 7 people requiring hospitalization. No deaths have been reported.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the odd diseases corner we have N. meningitidis eye infections &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/misc-emerging-topics/report-describes-n-meningitidis-conjunctivitis-outbreak-us-military-base" target="_blank"&gt;on a military base.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Ticks are products of their environment, and humans have played many roles in turning them into the harmful parasites that seek us out today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This edited article is republished from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://theconversation.com/" target="_blank" data-url="http://theconversation.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

It can spread between wild birds and domestic poultry through direct contact, contaminated equipment, or the clothing and shoes of caretakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus poses the greatest threat to poultry flocks such as chickens, ducks, and turkeys, as well as certain wild birds, including vultures, geese, and raptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials provided guidance for flock owners: commercial poultry producers should alert their company immediately if they observe signs of illness. Backyard flock owners noticing bird flu symptoms should contact the Maryland Department of Agriculture Animal Health team at md.birdflu@maryland.gov, animalhealth.mda@maryland.gov, or call 410-841-5810. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sick or dead birds must not be moved off-site for testing. Additionally, backyard flock owners are required to register their flocks with the state to support the safety of Maryland’s poultry industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO | &lt;a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/expert-political-violenceitizens-feel-unheard-charlie-kirks-assassination-murder-shooter-tyler-robinson-political-activist-far-right-far-left-extremism-utah-shooting-school-shooting-widow-speaks-out-trump-vance#" target="_blank" title="https://wjla.com/news/local/expert-political-violenceitizens-feel-unheard-charlie-kirks-assassination-murder-shooter-tyler-robinson-political-activist-far-right-far-left-extremism-utah-shooting-school-shooting-widow-speaks-out-trump-vance#" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Expert warns political violence rises as citizens feel unheard after Kirk's assassination&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Maryland Department of Natural Resources urges waterfowl hunters to use caution when handling game, wash their hands and clothing afterward, and keep dedicated tools separate from domestic poultry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who encounters a dead wild bird should call the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service at 1-877-463-6497, which is coordinating collection and disposal efforts.
