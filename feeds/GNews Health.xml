			&lt;p&gt;Nearly &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/high-blood-pressure/data-research/facts-stats/index.html#"&gt;half of all Americans have high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; – a &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410"&gt;condition called hypertension&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypertension is the No. 1 risk factor for heart disease and stroke. In addition, hypertension increases risk of dementia and cognitive decline. Heart disease, stroke, and dementia are the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm#"&gt;first-, fourth- and sixth-leading causes of death&lt;/a&gt; in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, only 1 in 4 people with a history of high blood pressure have this condition under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/us-has-new-guidelines-for-high-blood-pressure-heres-what-that-means"&gt;US Has New Guidelines For High Blood Pressure. Here's What That Means.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August 2025, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology released &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;new guidelines on prevention and management of hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, based on a comprehensive analysis of literature published over the past 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Conversation US asked &lt;a href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/24559"&gt;cardiologist Dr. William Cornwell&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus to explain what the new guidelines mean and how you can work with your doctor to manage your blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the primary takeaways of the new guidelines?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most recent guidelines &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000065"&gt;prior to this new statement were in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Since that time, the medical community has learned a lot about hypertension and the best way to control it. The new guidelines provide a great deal of new information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the definition of hypertension has changed. The criteria are more strict, and the target blood pressures are lower than in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criteria depend on the values of the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/which-blood-pressure-number-is-important"&gt;"systolic" and the "diastolic" pressure&lt;/a&gt;. Systolic blood pressure, the top number, represents the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is squeezing blood into the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diastolic blood pressure, the bottom number, is the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is relaxing. Both numbers are important when determining the severity of hypertension and how it is most appropriately managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines have removed the category of "prehypertension," which was defined by a systolic pressure of 120-139 millimeters of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mercury" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="72978" data-postid="175244" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;mercury&lt;/a&gt; (mm Hg), or a diastolic pressure of 80-99 mm Hg. Now, patients are categorized as having "elevated blood pressure" if their blood pressure is 120-129 over less than 80 mm Hg, or stage 1 hypertension if they are 130-139/80-89.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reading of 140/90 or more is considered stage 2 hypertension, and a reading of 180/120 or greater is a hypertensive crisis. In essence, the bar has been lowered, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.125.25466"&gt;this change may impact millions of Americans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People need to ask their doctors if they have hypertension based on these new criteria and whether or not they should be treated. It is also very important for patients to get advice from their doctors about lifestyle habits that they can incorporate into their daily routine, like diet, exercise, and healthy sleep habits to help lower blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the guidelines encourage providers to use a risk calculator, called PREVENT – short for &lt;a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/guidelines-and-statements/prevent-risk-calculator/prevent-calculator"&gt;Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease EVENTS&lt;/a&gt; – to determine a patient's overall risk of cardiovascular disease and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tool represents a significant advance in personalizing medical care, since it incorporates risk factors unique to the individual, allowing for a tailored approach to medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the link between alcohol intake and high blood pressure?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines encourage people to limit alcohol intake because alcohol increases blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/meta-analysis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73088" data-postid="175244" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of seven studies with nearly 20,000 people showed that systolic blood pressure will &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.123.21224"&gt;increase by about 1mmHg for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A standard beer contains about 14 grams of alcohol, so regular alcohol consumption may increase blood pressure by several points over time. For people who have been drinking an excessive amount of alcohol but stop, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/01.HYP.33.2.653"&gt;their blood pressure may come back down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might not sound like much, but when combined with other unhealthy and risky behaviors, like sedentary behavior, excessive weight, inadequate sleep, psychological stress, and smoking, the risk factors start to add up quickly. Together, they can very quickly &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001303"&gt;increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175247" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175247" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BP_drinking_alcohol_642.jpg" alt="wine poured into a glass" class="wp-image-175247 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BP_drinking_alcohol_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BP_drinking_alcohol_642-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175247" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cutting back on alcohol is one way to keep blood pressure down. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADFFHBns0U/"&gt;NatashaPhoto/Getty Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines encourage patients to reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption entirely compared with the old guidelines. For people who do want to drink alcohol, the new guidelines recommend that men should drink no more than two drinks per day, and women should drink no more than one drink per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What other lifestyle factors did the new report focus on?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines also emphasize the fact that diet can have a major impact on blood pressure. They recommend that all adults – with or without hypertension – consume less than 2,300 milligrams of salt, or approximately 1 teaspoon, per day, and more ideally, less than 1,500 milligrams per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a comparison, the average &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salt/about/index.html"&gt;American eats more than 3,300 milligrams of salt&lt;/a&gt; per day. Patients may also consider potassium-based salt substitutes to further lower blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines recommend a specific diet called the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt;, short for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, for patients with or without hypertension to prevent or treat elevated blood pressure. The DASH diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, low-fat or nonfat dairy, and whole grains. This diet may &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;lead to a reduction in blood pressure by up about 10 mm Hg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines also emphasize the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;need to increase physical activity&lt;/a&gt;. On average, for every additional 30 minutes of aerobic exercise a person gets per week, systolic blood pressure decreases by 2 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure drops by 1 mm Hg, with the largest reduction occurring at 150 minutes of dynamic exercise per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175248" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175248" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BP_exercise_642.jpg" alt="woman exercising" class="wp-image-175248 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BP_exercise_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BP_exercise_642-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175248" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Regular exercise each week can help blood pressure drop. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEIzLj9bBE/"&gt;FatCamera/Getty Images Signature/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular exercise also helps you live longer and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/as-wrestling-fans-reel-from-the-sudden-death-of-hulk-hogan-a-cardiologist-explains-how-to-live-long-and-healthy-and-avoid-chronic-disease-262103"&gt;reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the main preventive strategies in the report?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PREVENT risk calculator that the new guidelines recommend incorporates several factors, including demographics, cholesterol levels, medical history, and blood pressure, to determine risk. This risk calculator is &lt;a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/guidelines-and-statements/prevent-risk-calculator/prevent-calculator"&gt;free and available online&lt;/a&gt; to the general public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PREVENT calculator may be a helpful tool for all Americans since it reliably provides patients and providers with an assessment of overall risk assessment. But it is particularly helpful for people with multiple chronic conditions, like hypertension, high cholesterol, overweight/obesity, or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="175244" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association recommends &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/lifes-essential-8"&gt;eight essential health behaviors&lt;/a&gt; for controlling blood pressure and reducing risk of cardiovascular disease overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include healthy diet, regular exercise, stopping or avoiding smoking, sleeping seven to nine hours per night, and controlling weight, cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Will the new guidelines change how doctors address high blood pressure?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest advances with these new guidelines is the personalized approach to medical care through the use of the PREVENT calculator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines recommend that doctors encourage their patients to check blood pressure at home to better understand the fluctuations in pressure that occur throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the guidelines encourage physicians to be more aggressive about treating blood pressure. This may be an important change since uncontrolled blood pressure is a major risk factor for eventual development of heart disease and stroke.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263507/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;I was under the mistaken impression that Health Secretary Worm-Brain’s restrictions on covid vaccinations were already in place. However, when I went to a drug store today for my annual flu shot, I asked if covid shots were still available, and, to my surprise, they were! So I got the newest covid shot in addition to a current flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the near future, RFK Jr. plans to limit access to covid vaccinations to people 65 and over; and to those with serious health conditions. I don’t know how soon it will be when the baseless new vaccine restrictions will be implemented; and implementation might vary from state to state; even though the whole idea of limiting vaccine access is coming from the federal level, via Mr. Worm-Brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are able to do so, you ought to get a covid vaccination now! If you’ve already had one fairly recently and you’re unsure if you’re due for an update, err on the side of caution and get one! No one has ever overdosed on vaccinations. And thanks to Health Secretary Worm-Brain, we might no longer have the luxury of waiting a while for our next covid shot.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;“You have certain groups — the Amish, for example — that have essentially no autism,” &lt;a href="https://people.com/trump-rfk-jr-says-tylenol-causes-autism-11814830" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; President Donald Trump with trademark certainty yesterday. Stood next to his Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., he suggested that Amish people have low levels of autism because Amish women don’t take paracetamol (sold as Tylenol in the US) during pregnancy. Famously, they also don’t spend their days glued to screens; they’re too busy churning butter, raising barns and producing dozens of children. But Trump chose to point the finger at painkillers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent1" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinicians across the world scrambled to rebut him. In Britain, Health Secretary Wes Streeting replied, “I trust doctors over President Trump.” It’s easy to be smug, but whatever the driver, Trump is right about one thing: autism figures are rocketing. A generation ago, the condition was rare. By 2000, one in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/ss/ss7402a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;150 eight-year-olds&lt;/a&gt; in the US had a diagnosis; by 2022, it was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/autism/data-research/index.html"&gt;one in 31&lt;/a&gt;. The UK is following the same pattern. Diagnoses rose 787% between &lt;a href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.13505"&gt;1998 and 2018,&lt;/a&gt; and the BMA now estimates one in 100 British children &lt;a href="https://www.bma.org.uk/what-we-do/population-health/improving-the-health-of-specific-groups/autism-spectrum-disorder" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;has an ASD label.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a narrow category, “autism spectrum disorder” has metastasised into a fashionable identity. The label now stretches from children who will never speak or live independently to tech titans like Elon Musk. Now that the stigma has ebbed away, pushy middle-class parents angle for diagnoses to give their offspring an educational edge, while students at elite universities &lt;a href="https://thecritic.co.uk/issues/march-2025/oxford-on-the-spectrum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;self-identify&lt;/a&gt; as autistic for both extra exam time and the warm glow of victimhood. Meanwhile, those with the most profound needs — whose families are exhausted by round-the-clock care — are increasingly drowned out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academics have begun to notice. Professor Ginny Russell of Exeter University &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/mar/04/uk-increase-autism-diagnoses-neurodiversity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;warns&lt;/a&gt; that ever-wider criteria, often based on self-description rather than clinical observation, risk a situation where “maybe everyone is categorised as neurodiverse”. “As awareness and diagnoses increase, those with less severe symptoms come forward with their own stories of how autism affects them,” Russell says. “The diagnostic criteria is widened to take these accounts on board, which loops back again to another increase in diagnoses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not simply a medical question but a cultural one: a disorder once marked by silence and incapacity has become a lazy shorthand for genius. Yet diagnostic creep can only explain part of the phenomenon. Something else is happening to children. As evolutionary biologist Heather Heying writes in &lt;i&gt;A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century,&lt;/i&gt; the “uptick in diagnoses on the autism spectrum” may be “related to the number of children who were raised staring into screens.” “Do not let inanimate objects babysit your children,” Heying commands, “Those seemingly alive creatures, which cannot and therefore will not respond to a child’s looks or gestures or questions, send the message to the developing brain that the world is not an emotionally responsive place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, toddlers pacified by&lt;em&gt; Peppa Pig&lt;/em&gt; on repeat learn that the world does not answer back. Reduced eye contact, poor reciprocity, repetitive behaviours: the classic signifiers of autism can also be the hallmarks of children’s behaviour when raised on screens. If we wanted to manufacture a generation displaying autistic-like traits, we could hardly have done better than to outsource parenting to iPads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent2" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author and psychotherapist Joe Burgo, who works with teenagers who identify as trans, sees the same detachment. Patients who “spend countless hours online in virtual interactions, playing video games, and social media scrolling,” he tells me, become unmoored. “This leads to a dissociated experience of being in your head rather than down in your body where you might notice your feeling states. This dissociation is what we’re seeing rather than true ASD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surge in diagnoses, then, is likely twofold: ever-expanding criteria and an environment that fosters autistic mimicry. Tackling it will require more than scolding expectant mothers for taking paracetamol. It means resisting the pathologisation of every quirk, and it means putting down our phones — parents as well as children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Trump may have been half-right. For all their butter-churning and barn-raising, the Amish really might be on to something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="midcontent3" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                            
                                                        &lt;hr&gt;

                            &lt;p id="midcontent2" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Those studies, however, focused on older people and didn’t differentiate between former drinkers and lifelong nondrinkers, thus potentially skewing the results, study authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the new study, published Tuesday in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjebm2025-113913" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, researchers analyzed how certain genes linked to alcohol might impact how liquor consumption affects the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The genetic analyses results (showed) that even small amounts of alcohol could increase dementia risk,” said lead study author Anya Topiwala, a senior clinical researcher in the department of psychiatry at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This is the largest study on the topic, and the combination of observational and genetic analyses was key,” Topiwala said via email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The genetic analysis, called Mendelian randomization, has less risk of introducing a confounding or “spurious” variable to explain the alcohol-dementia relationship, Topiwala said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Mendelian randomization also reduces the chance of reverse causation, such as dementia processes influencing drinking rather than the reverse, and it can also estimate the cumulative impact of alcohol consumption over a person’s entire life, Topiwala said. Observational studies, however, tend to capture a snapshot of mid- to late-life drinking habits, and depend on subject recall, which may not be accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This is a fairly complicated study that provides some, but not definitive evidence, that alcohol can harm the brain regardless of how much is consumed,” said neurologist Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida. Isaacson, who conducts studies on cognitive improvement in people who are genetically at risk for Alzheimer’s disease, was not involved in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“In my clinic, we tell people with the APOE4 genetic variant, which is the most common genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s, that drinking zero alcohol is best based on the available evidence,” he said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, for people with less genetic risk for Alzheimer’s it often depends on “when” and “how” people drink, Isaacson added. For example, he said, two drinks before bed on an empty stomach several nights will have a more harmful effect on brain health compared with one drink a few times a week with an early dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you drink may impact how alcohol affects your body, according to neurologist Dr. Richard Isaacson. - skynesher/E+/Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;An emerging link between alcohol and dementia&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The new study looked at data from nearly 560,000 people who participated in the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UK Biobank;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt;, a longitudinal study that included participants from England, Scotland and Wales, and the &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fu7061146.ct.sendgrid.net%2Fls%2Fclick%3Fupn%3Du001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC-2B-2FcGjIObrNSpDAzLgn3dTfioeF6ZLIGlJnAtzhla-2FMB-b5y_sGhGCVpwFe-2F7omibEFFkS2OLk-2BdOXuEASIRdx2x8JgEFQyU0wnkVnFTYr98WHiItd5mAU-2BAp3fGMKwThCzfas-2BIy2J5J2TQRaHk0rY-2BYi8gC68WDt7KNqJGjf671sFq0CreRdLntWVvjhjzWnR4ZK1KbkuSYkyDNH1Oo-2BB3-2FMU1s5Fa3yqYUcB7ngOTRt7Pwv0xvkH0e8v4Q-2BzkUoEa5sYp2n-2BhStbxC8ArvgXgFTf05LkBWEQ4Y0QMkScZSHhM6jcMcBG9TWmNu0OJWyPMSYYPjWljvzcDV-2BLnsODoLlv337JC7gInsDHAyCJ-2BlO0xiPr5XulFb8Z7Bznn7JViXW4ZFAANpA0dyr-2FGBsN9AheU-3D&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Csandee.lamotte%40cnn.com%7Ca3cadbb3bde44fc3fd1e08ddf77ca15d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638938836851695641%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=MeoB4Om0KaUrNG4480l1FFE2glKRN59KJ2ee8xfgCHw%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:US Million Veteran Program;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;US Million Veteran Program&lt;/a&gt;, or MVP, which includes people of European, African and Latin American ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In that observational part of the study, people provided self-reports of how much they drank, and researchers compared alcohol consumption with their risk of developing dementia over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“In the self-reporting study, people who reported consuming small amounts of alcohol (less than 7 drinks per week) had lower risk than heavy drinkers (more than 40 drinks per week),” said Tara Spires-Jones, professor of neurodegeneration and director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Interestingly, in this part of the study, non-drinkers and people who reported never drinking actually had similar risk of dementia to people who drank heavily,” said Spires-Jones, who is also a group leader in the UK Dementia Research Institute in London. She was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study then examined genetics from 45 studies of dementia in 2.4 million people and compared genetic markers associated with alcohol use over a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Higher genetic risk was associated with an increased risk of dementia, with a linear increase in dementia risk the higher the alcohol consumption, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There is a 15% higher dementia risk for 3 drinks per week compared to 1 drink per week across life,” Topiwala said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In addition, a doubling in the genetic risk of alcohol dependency was associated with a 16% increase in dementia risk, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Neither part of the study can conclusively prove that alcohol use directly causes dementia,” Spires-Jones said. “But this adds to a large amount of similar data showing associations between alcohol intake and increased dementia risk, and fundamental neuroscience work has shown that alcohol is directly toxic to neurons in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.

The results did not paint a pretty picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The mice, especially the older ones, started to show behavioral changes eerily similar to dementia. The plastic particles crossed the blood-brain barrier, causing inflammation in the brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Jaime Ross, the study's lead author, told the Post she was alarmed by how quickly the changes took place, saying: "I'm still really surprised by it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is this concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This isn't just an isolated finding. The concern is that these plastic particles could be an environmental trigger for neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7620/adf8ae" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:published;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in Environmental Research Communications found that when mice with a high-risk gene for Alzheimer's, APOE4, were exposed to microplastics, they showed significant cognitive and behavioral changes that weren't seen in mice without the gene. This suggests that microplastics could interact with genetic predispositions to accelerate disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The problem is made worse by daily exposure. We're constantly in contact with plastics, and another study has raised concerns about cytotoxicity from microplastics, especially from food containers that are heated or cooled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about it?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the science is alarming, the good news is that people are tackling this problem from every angle. It starts with simple choices, and there's a lot of &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-less-plastic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:helpful information;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;helpful information&lt;/a&gt; available on how to use less plastic in our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Innovation is also providing hope. To get these particles out of our environment, researchers have developed a new kind of filter designed to catch even the smallest bits of plastic that usually slip through water treatment systems. For plastics already in our bodies, scientists have discovered a promising new way to filter microplastics out of human blood using a method similar to dialysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the fight to protect our health, another study found that powerful antioxidants found in many fruits and flowers can counteract some of the dangerous effects that microplastic exposure can have on the reproductive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the link between microplastics and cognitive decline is deeply concerning, emerging scientific breakthroughs in filtering our water, cleansing our bodies, and using natural compounds to protect our health offer a hopeful path forward in tackling the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/tech-newsletter/?rec7QW0GpshZ5tm1o" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for weekly updates on the latest innovations &lt;strong&gt;improving our lives&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;shaping our future&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 21:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNUGZDTHp6YW1rNHBPSmU5cllIMkJkOWhqWUpCbzRnUzNWXzJBQ01iR3VWTkRHMGgweU41cnFiWEdkVVEydG9JOGlDQmJqc2J0cEVnOTNuNmwzMFo5eGt1MTRBczk5VDAzTldPNldkOTdWM1JnenFCYkNZQzRVR0R3aFJiS2c3Z3U5MWdDR0s5MWUxWlpjSzYtWTY1TXNqQQ</guid></item><item><title>受影响的寡妇在他们最喜欢的海滩的小牛水中划桨后，因食肉细菌而失去了丈夫-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15127087/Virginia-Beach-vibrio-bacteria-infection-dead-husband.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

'So its just so sad that the best place that we had is where he got sick.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Four days after the couple's trip to the beach, D'Arcy noticed a purple stripe on her husband's leg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The husband and wife sent his blood for testing, but by the time the test came back positive for vibrio another three days later, the infection had already spread across both his legs, causing severe damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Derek had a weakened immune system due to being on dialysis, which D'Arcy believes contributed to the rapid spread of the infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors determined that the only way to save Derek was by amputating his legs to stop the infection from spreading. Sadly, they didn't act quickly enough and just 12 hours after the surgery, the vibrio bacteria had spread Derek's chest, hands and head. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At that point, 'we knew we lost the fight,' D'Arcy said. Her husband would die around a week later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Joyce D'Arcy and her husband, Derek, took a seemingly harmless trip to Virginia Beach where the husband was infected with a flesh-eating bacteria that would take his life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Virginia Beach (pictured) was the couple's 'absolute favorite place to go'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Vibrio infections are surprisingly common, and experts say one in five people who are infected will die&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The widow hopes her story can serve as a warning to others about how quickly a person can die to the aggressive, flesh-eating bacteria and that awareness can save another family from experiencing a similar tragic and unexpected loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cleveland Clinic doctors say vibrio is more common than people think, especially in the warmer months of May through October. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infections happen fairly often.  Most people survive but symptoms are very painful and many sufferers must face having limbs amputated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last month, &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/health/article-14983485/Deadly-flesh-eating-bacteria-spread-beaches-cases-surge-terrifying-rise.html"&gt;cases of vibrio infection rose into the double digits&lt;/a&gt; along the Gulf Coast and further up Atlantic Coast.  Experts believe the rising infections are caused by warming waters as the bacteria thrives in waters between 68 degrees Fahrenheit and 95 degrees Fahrenheit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/news/article-15065795/florida-mom-death-flesh-eating-bacteria-beach.html"&gt;a mother was left fighting for her life and almost lost her leg&lt;/a&gt; after contracting vibrio when she swam at Quietwater Beach in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also earlier this month,&lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/news/article-15056609/Vibrio-vulnificus-flesh-eating-bacteria-florida.html"&gt; a father contracted a vibrio infection after a fishing trip&lt;/a&gt;, which caused serious swelling and a burning sensation in his foot and ankle. It took three surgeries for doctors to stop the spread of the infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control estimates that one in five people who are infected with vibrio will die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="333" data-end="597"&gt;We live in a world where women are praised for being “strong” and “resilient.” On the outside, it looks like they’ve got it together—juggling careers, families, friendships, and everything in between. But here’s the truth: strength can sometimes mask exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="599" data-end="822"&gt;I’ve seen it in my own circles—women smiling through clenched teeth, showing up for everyone else while quietly running on empty. And maybe you’ve felt it yourself: that tug between appearing fine and actually being okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="824" data-end="1009"&gt;Burnout doesn’t always announce itself with a dramatic breakdown. More often, it slips in quietly, disguised as everyday habits and coping strategies. That’s why it’s so easy to miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1011" data-end="1143"&gt;If you’ve been wondering whether you—or someone you love—might be silently struggling, here are nine subtle signs to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1150" data-end="1181"&gt;1. She laughs everything off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1183" data-end="1415"&gt;Humor can be a brilliant coping tool. It allows us to soften the heaviness of life and connect with others. But when every struggle is brushed aside with a joke or a quick laugh, it may be less about joy and more about deflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1417" data-end="1625"&gt;I once caught myself laughing while telling a friend, “Oh, I barely slept all week, but who needs rest, right?” The truth was, I was completely depleted. That kind of humor isn’t lighthearted—it’s a shield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1627" data-end="1964"&gt;Psychologists call this &lt;a href="https://www.peacheycounselling.ca/blog/the-mental-health-effects-of-masking-how-you-feel?.com"&gt;“masking,”&lt;/a&gt; and it often prevents deeper conversations. Friends and coworkers hear the joke and move on, never realizing there’s pain beneath the surface. If you pay close attention, you’ll notice the humor doesn’t quite land as joy—it lands as avoidance. And avoidance is one of burnout’s favorite hiding spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1971" data-end="2000"&gt;2. She’s always “too busy”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2002" data-end="2157"&gt;Ever notice how some women keep their calendars packed to the brim? Work meetings, social gatherings, errands, volunteer work—anything to stay in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2159" data-end="2412"&gt;On the surface, it looks like ambition. But sometimes busyness is just burnout in disguise. When you’re constantly running from one task to another, there’s no space left to sit with uncomfortable feelings. Busyness becomes a distraction from reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2414" data-end="2759"&gt;As Rudá Iandê notes in &lt;em data-start="2437" data-end="2500"&gt;&lt;a class="decorated-link" href="https://thevessel.io/laughing-in-the-face-of-chaos-book/" target="_new" rel="noopener" data-start="2438" data-end="2499"&gt;Laughing in the Face of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, “the more we try to escape or numb the chaos within, the more powerful the currents become.” His words hit me hard because I used to fill every spare hour just to avoid slowing down. Stillness can feel scary when your emotions are screaming for attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2761" data-end="2931"&gt;Here’s the paradox: the very thing that looks like high functioning is often a sign that someone is hanging on by a thread. She’s not thriving—she’s outrunning herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2938" data-end="2985"&gt;3. Her sleep patterns are all over the place&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2987" data-end="3165"&gt;Sleep is often the first casualty of burnout. She may collapse into bed early but wake at 3 a.m. with racing thoughts. Or she may stay up late scrolling, dreading the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3167" data-end="3349"&gt;Sleep disruption doesn’t just mean feeling groggy in the morning. It means her nervous system is stuck in overdrive. Even when her body begs for rest, her mind refuses to shut off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3351" data-end="3545"&gt;I’ve been there—lying in bed, exhausted but wired, rehearsing tomorrow’s to-do list over and over. For women pretending to be fine, poor sleep becomes the quiet evidence that something is off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3547" data-end="3778"&gt;Research consistently &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/1/e012816?.com"&gt;links burnout to insomnia&lt;/a&gt;, and left unchecked, it creates a vicious cycle. The less she sleeps, the more drained she becomes—and the harder it gets to admit she’s struggling. Burnout thrives in that silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3785" data-end="3823"&gt;4. She avoids talking about herself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3825" data-end="4004"&gt;Have you ever noticed how some women are brilliant at steering the spotlight away from themselves? Ask how they’re doing and suddenly you’re talking about your own life instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4006" data-end="4212"&gt;This isn’t just politeness. It’s self-protection. Talking about herself might open the door to emotions she’s not ready to face. So she avoids vulnerability and instead turns the conversation back to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4214" data-end="4415"&gt;It’s easy to mistake this for being “selfless” or “a great listener.” But if you scratch beneath the surface, it’s often a way of hiding. Pretending to be “fine” feels safer than admitting she’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4417" data-end="4558"&gt;This is one of the trickiest signs because it often looks like strength. But avoidance, in this case, is exhaustion wearing a polite smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4565" data-end="4598"&gt;5. She downplays her struggles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4600" data-end="4784"&gt;A woman might casually mention, “I’ve just been a little tired lately,” when in reality she’s hanging on by a thread. Or she might frame serious stress as “just one of those things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4786" data-end="5048"&gt;This isn’t denial—it’s survival. Admitting the full weight of her exhaustion feels overwhelming, so she minimizes it. Unfortunately, the more she downplays, the more isolated she becomes. Others assume she doesn’t need help, and the cycle of silence continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5050" data-end="5363"&gt;This is where Rudá Iandê’s insight rings true: “When we let go of the need to be perfect, we free ourselves to live fully—embracing the mess, complexity, and richness of a life that's delightfully real.” I’ve noticed how often women feel pressure to be “low-maintenance,” as though asking for support is a flaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5365" data-end="5438"&gt;But constant minimization is not strength—it’s a quiet cry for support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5445" data-end="5478"&gt;6. Her body carries the weight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5480" data-end="5617"&gt;Burnout rarely stays in the mind. It makes its home in the body: tension headaches, tight shoulders, stomach issues, unexplained aches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5619" data-end="5799"&gt;I once went through months of stress that showed up as constant migraines. It took me ages to realize my body was trying to tell me what my mouth wouldn’t say: “You’re not okay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5801" data-end="6041"&gt;Experts in somatic psychology emphasize that our bodies speak for us when we won’t. A woman insisting she’s fine while constantly battling physical symptoms isn’t lying—she may genuinely not connect the dots yet. But the body rarely lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5801" data-end="6041"&gt;A recent Swedish study found that people with high burnout &lt;a href="https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2%3A1742868/FULLTEXT01.pdf?.com"&gt;report many somatic symptoms&lt;/a&gt;—headaches, back pain, stomach problems, trouble sleeping—far more often than people without burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6043" data-end="6195"&gt;When physical pain becomes routine and excuses like “just stress” or “nothing serious” get repeated, it’s worth asking whether burnout has taken root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6202" data-end="6230"&gt;7. She withdraws socially&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6232" data-end="6452"&gt;On paper, she’s still present—she shows up at gatherings, sends birthday texts, maybe even posts on social media. But her engagement is surface-level. Conversations feel flat. She’s there, but she’s not &lt;em data-start="6435" data-end="6443"&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6454" data-end="6616"&gt;Emotional burnout can make even lighthearted interactions feel draining. So while she might maintain appearances, she may quietly dread every social obligation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6618" data-end="6759"&gt;The irony? Many women fear that pulling back entirely will “let people down.” So they perform presence while secretly longing for solitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6761" data-end="6915"&gt;Withdrawal doesn’t always look like disappearing. Sometimes it looks like her being “fine” in public and collapsing in private the moment she gets home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6922" data-end="6955"&gt;8. She relies on small escapes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6957" data-end="7140"&gt;Wine at night. Endless streaming binges. Scrolling until her eyes blur. None of these things are inherently bad. But when they become daily rituals, it often signals deeper fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7142" data-end="7291"&gt;As one therapist explained in a seminar I attended, avoidance often masquerades as relaxation. What looks like “self-care” may actually be numbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7293" data-end="7461"&gt;When the coping strategies pile up—snacks, wine, social media, shopping—it’s not indulgence. It’s a quiet attempt to silence the exhaustion she doesn’t want to admit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7463" data-end="7656"&gt;Burnout doesn’t always scream—it whispers through little habits that add up over time. Pay attention to what she reaches for at the end of the day. It’s often the clue to what she’s avoiding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7663" data-end="7695"&gt;9. She’s overly accommodating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7697" data-end="7850"&gt;Have you met women who always say yes, always bend, always prioritize others? From the outside, it looks generous. But inside, it can feel suffocating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7852" data-end="8062"&gt;I’ve been there myself—saying yes to everyone else while my own needs went unmet. What I learned, painfully, is that people-pleasing often stems from emotional exhaustion. It’s easier to comply than to argue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8064" data-end="8317"&gt;As Iandê reminds us, “Being human means inevitably disappointing and hurting others, and the sooner you accept this reality, the easier it becomes to navigate life’s challenges.” A woman constantly saying yes isn’t thriving—she’s running on autopilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8319" data-end="8476"&gt;Over-accommodation may look like compassion, but in reality, it’s a signal she’s too tired to hold boundaries. And boundaries are what keep burnout at bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8483" data-end="8500"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8502" data-end="8661"&gt;Burnout doesn’t always look like collapse. Sometimes it looks like a woman smiling, joking, and assuring everyone she’s fine—while quietly unraveling inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8663" data-end="8827"&gt;The danger in ignoring these signs is that burnout compounds. The longer it goes unacknowledged, the harder it is to recover. That’s why awareness is so powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8829" data-end="8978"&gt;If you see yourself in these patterns, know this: you’re not weak, and you’re not alone. Burnout is not a personal failing—it’s a human experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8980" data-end="9209"&gt;Start small. Rest without guilt. Speak honestly, even if your voice shakes. And most importantly, remember this: you don’t have to keep pretending you’re fine. Sometimes the bravest thing you can do is to admit that you’re not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Legume-based pasta is the top choice — made from chickpeas, lentils, black beans, or peas, it offers far more fiber, protein, vitamins, and minerals than traditional wheat pasta.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nutrition labels matter — experts recommend looking for pasta with at least 5 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein per serving, plus added nutrients like iron for a more filling and balanced option.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Taste and use are versatile — chickpea pasta is closest to regular pasta in flavor, while lentil and black bean versions are earthier; all work well in traditional pasta dishes, especially when paired with vegetables and healthy fats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As far as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-shelf-stable-foods-11740097" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pantry staples&lt;/a&gt; go, you can’t go wrong with dried pasta. The ingredient is a base for countless dishes, from classic &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/shellfish-spaghetti-8410404" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Shellfish Spaghetti&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/browse-all-recipes/lemony-linguine-with-olives-and-feta-recipe" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Lemony Linguine With Olives and Feta&lt;/a&gt;. Traditional pasta also mainly consists of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/what-are-refined-carbs" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;refined carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt;, which can be an easy source of energy. The drawback? Refined carbs are digested quickly, so you might feel hungry soon after eating pasta.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With that in mind, you may be looking for a “healthier” pasta with a greater variety of nutrients. To help support your search, we asked three registered dietitians to recommend the healthiest type of pasta you can buy, plus what to look for when shopping for pasta.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-look-for-in-dried-pasta"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Look for in Dried Pasta &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As with other foods, all types of pasta can be included in a balanced diet, and there’s no harm in enjoying traditional varieties. The “healthiest” type also depends on your goals and needs, per registered dietitian Samantha Peterson, MS, RD.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nynutritiongroup.com/lisa" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Moskovitz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, RD, CDN, a registered dietitian, founder of NY Nutrition Group, and author of &lt;em&gt;The Core 3 Healthy Eating Plan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But generally, if you’re looking for the most nutrient-dense option, there are some things to consider. “If nutrition is a priority, compare &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/red-flags-on-food-labels-8781749" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;‘nutrition facts’ labels&lt;/a&gt; to see which pasta contains more important nutrients to distinguish the ‘healthier’ option,” suggests registered dietitian Connie Elick, MS, RD. These key nutrients primarily include &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-much-is-too-much-protein-8407660" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-much-fiber-do-you-need-a-day-7564730" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which are both essential.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Registered dietitian Lisa Moskovitz, RD, agrees: “If you’re looking for the most nutritious pasta, you’ll want to beeline to the fiber section first on the food label. Any brand with more than 5 grams of fiber per serving is a great source of this digestion-regulating, heart-healthy, and blood sugar-stabilizing nutrient.” Bonus points if each serving also contains at least 5 grams of muscle-preserving protein, and at least 25 percent of the RDA for &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-high-in-iron-8702307" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, Moskovitz points out.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-healthiest-type-of-pasta"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Healthiest Type of Pasta &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, which type of pasta checks all these boxes? According to the three dietitians we interviewed, legume-based pasta is one of the best choices.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As the name suggests, legume-based pasta is made with legumes rather than wheat. This may include &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/chickpeas-nutrition-6744549" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chickpeas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health-benefits-of-black-beans-7254820" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;black beans&lt;/a&gt;, and red, green, or yellow lentils, notes Peterson. “Some brands also blend in &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/health-benefits-of-peas" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;peas&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/edamame-nutrition" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;edamame&lt;/a&gt;,” she adds. And per Peterson, each legume offers its own subtle flavor and nutrient profile, but they’re all naturally rich in fiber and plant-based protein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For context, legume pasta contains about five times more fiber than traditional white flour pasta, per Moskovitz. Here’s why that’s noteworthy: “Fiber is your gut’s best friend,” Moskovitz explains. “It keeps &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-to-help-you-poop-11769125" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;digestion running smoothly&lt;/a&gt;, feeds good bacteria, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/anti-inflammatory-lifestyle-habits-11769931" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduces inflammation&lt;/a&gt; for the average healthy adult,” she adds. Fiber also balances blood glucose levels and lowers cholesterol, says Elick. What’s more, “it helps to make you feel full sooner and longer, creating a sense of satiety that can help with weight management or weight loss,” Elick adds. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In the protein department, legume pasta shines too. According to Peterson, a serving can pack 12 to 20 grams of protein—at least double the amount found in traditional pasta. “Protein is essential for building and repairing tissues, supporting muscle strength, building metabolism, and keeping you full and satisfied longer,” says Peterson. It also supports a variety of biological processes, including &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-for-immune-system-7093660" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;immune function&lt;/a&gt;, hormone regulation, and DNA repair, per Elick.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, legume-based pasta offers more minerals and vitamins than standard versions. “Many legume-based pastas contain &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/plant-based-foods-with-more-iron-than-steak-11793217" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based iron&lt;/a&gt;, which helps your body transport oxygen and maintain steady energy,” shares Peterson. They also offer &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/foods-high-in-magnesium" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/foods-high-in-potassium" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/healthy-eating/folate-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;folate&lt;/a&gt;, which are involved in muscle function, blood pressure balance, and DNA synthesis, respectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Finally, legume pastas are typically higher in &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/shopping-storing/food/antioxidant-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;, making it easy to boost your intake of these key molecules. “Antioxidants fight inflammation and protect the body against chronic degenerative diseases, like Alzheimer’s and cardiovascular disease,” says Moskovitz.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-eat-legume-based-pasta"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How to Eat Legume-Based Pasta &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In general, you can swap regular pasta for the legume kind in all your favorite &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/easy-pasta-recipes-7971375" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pasta recipes&lt;/a&gt;. However, it’s worth noting that legume pasta tends to have a heartier, slightly nuttier taste, and a smoother bite, notes Peterson. “Chickpea pasta is the mildest—closest to regular pasta—while lentil or black bean versions can have a more earthy flavor. The texture is often denser, which makes the dish feel more filling,” she explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pro tip: “For the most balanced plate, pair legume pasta with colorful veggies and a drizzle of &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/olive-oil-health-benefits-8754789" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;olive oil,&lt;/a&gt;” recommends Peterson. The vegetables add antioxidants and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/vegetables-with-more-vitamin-c-than-an-orange-11768257" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which supports iron absorption from legumes. Meanwhile, the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-fats-8740244" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;healthy fats&lt;/a&gt; (from the olive oil) help your body absorb fat-soluble nutrients, Peterson points out.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But remember, you don’t need to completely ditch white pasta or stick to legume varieties for optimal health. Instead, you can consider legume pasta whenever you’re looking for a boost of nutrients and satiety.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Real Simple</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 21:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxNTFc4cVVaSWt0cTRtN1RGOVZpMExENnhHVnhwbHR4VnNPUmJLenRrSWpkbXdjekl2N0o2eHJlV1BxRHhHUG9hX3h1bnVWVVUzcFd4VlJ4SkwtaEpwaU15dE5kVlJvSnNhUTZyQzFVWHB1U3p0aFlZVi1YYWVlV180QU13</guid></item><item><title>佛罗里达州的COVID疫苗现在更容易获得： Publix和Walgreens提供疫苗- Sun Sentinel</title><link>https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/09/23/covid-vaccines-in-florida-are-now-easier-to-get-publix-and-walgreens-make-shots-available/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 updated boosters are now easier to get in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday, Publix and Walgreens pharmacies in Florida will begin administering the 2025-26 COVID-19 vaccines to eligible patients without a prescription. They join CVS and CVS Minute Clinic, which had already been administering the shots — although with a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walgreens spokesperson Brigid Sweeney said its Florida pharmacies are well stocked with booster shots and customers can make appointments on its portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In accordance with FDA approval, we offer the vaccine to all adults 65 years and older, as well as to individuals under 65 who are at higher risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19, as determined by the CDC,” Sweeney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-gbDoqmaV" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_gbDoqmaV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a href="https://floridaspharmacy.gov/"&gt; Florida Board of Pharmacy&lt;/a&gt; met on Tuesday and advised that under existing statutes and rules, pharmacists, interns, and technicians in Florida may administer FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines to eligible individuals 18 years and older under specific protocols. That means anyone 65 years of age and older are eligible to receive the vaccines, as well as individuals 64 years of age and younger with at least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Publix pharmacies are now accepting walk-ins for eligible patients, and we will begin offering appointments later today for as early as tomorrow,” Publix spokeswoman Lindsey Willis said Tuesday. Publix has 800 pharmacy locations in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both CVS and Walgreens representatives say their companies will ask patients under age 65 if they have any of these factors. They won’t require proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In simplest terms, if a patient says they’re eligible, they will get the vaccine,” said  Amy Thibault, the CVS Health spokeswoman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, though, any restrictions will be lifted, which is good news for Floridians who have been &lt;a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/09/09/covid-flu-rsv-vaccine-confusion-and-frustration-overwhelm-florida/"&gt;frustrated for weeks&lt;/a&gt; in their attempts to get the newest COVID booster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, vaccine advisers picked by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/09/19/covid-vaccines-cdc/"&gt;declined to specifically recommend the shots&lt;/a&gt; but said Americans could make individual decisions on whether to get them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommendations from the advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention require sign-off by the agency’s director, but they are almost always adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once the acting CDC director adopts the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)’s recent recommendations, Walgreens will offer the 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccines at locations nationwide, including in Florida, to individuals three years and older, no prescription required,” Sweeney had said of Walgreens.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Walgreens has 1,600 pharmacies in Florida, and some locations offer Moderna shots, while others provide Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people start seeking vaccinations in the late summer or early fall to get protection against winter surges in cases, as well as for protection on cruises and during other travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, CVS had been the only major retail pharmacy in the state giving out the 2025-2026 COVID booster shots. CVS had been requiring patients to be 65 or older or at risk for severe outcomes — and have a prescription. The CVS MinuteClinic also administered shots with a prescription or allowed a shot if its nurse practitioners prescribed it. Some CVS pharmacies carry the Moderna brand, while others carry Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The COVID-19 vaccine is covered by most insurance plans at no cost for eligible patients,” said Thibault of CVS Health. “Patients should check with their insurer to determine whether the updated COVID-19 vaccine is covered by their individual health plan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that most insurers &lt;a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/09/23/covid-19-vaccinations-insurance/"&gt;will cover the cost&lt;/a&gt; of the booster — at least through 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services said Friday that the committee vote “provides for immunization coverage through all payment mechanisms.” An HHS spokesperson said that includes Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, commercial coverage sold through health insurance marketplaces, and the federal Vaccines for Children program, which pays for roughly half of childhood vaccinations in the U.S. each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vaccines for Children program typically automatically covers any vaccines recommended by the CDC’s vaccine committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade group America’s Health Insurance Plans said earlier this week that its members will continue to cover the shots at no cost to patients through 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That group includes every major insurer except UnitedHealthcare. And that insurer has said it will continue covering the vaccine at no cost for its standard commercial coverage, which includes plans offered for individuals and through small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large employers with their own insurance plans will make their own decisions on the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to data presented to the CDC vaccine committee, about two-thirds of adults get COVID-19 shots at pharmacies, and around 30% receive them at doctors’ offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until this season, the U.S. has recommended yearly COVID-19 shots for everyone age 6 months and older.&lt;/p&gt;

Many also do not have health insurance, which means they pay out of pocket any time they go to the doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;He added that it‚Äôs hard to compare the study‚Äôs prevalence rate with the general population because the study only looked at Amish children and did not use the same autism screening tool to assess the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;That would be like giving different tests to students in a class and then trying to rank them by their scores.

								&lt;p&gt;The Minnesota Department of Health announced Monday it will break from federal guidance on the COVID-19 vaccine and endorse the recommendations of medical associations instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s panel of vaccine advisers opted not to give any recommendation on the 2025-26 COVID-19 vaccine, saying instead it’s an individual choice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="https://kstp.com/?p=3755105" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kennedy’s vaccine advisers change COVID shot guidance, calling them an individual choice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine skeptic, removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices this year and replace them with his handpicked appointees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, MDH officials are endorsing the advice of three independent medical associations: the &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32836/AAP-recommends-all-young-and-high-risk-children?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/news/media-center/statements/aafp-announces-fall-immunization-recommendations-reaffirming-commitment-to-vaccine-safety-and-public-health.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Academy of Family Physicians&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/covid-19-vaccination-considerations-for-obstetric-gynecologic-care"&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined, these associations recommend that all people six months and older should be able to receive the COVID-19 vaccine unhindered, with strong recommendations for children from six to 23 months, pregnant women, and children and adults with high-risk conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MDH Commissioner Brooke Cunningham said her agency is “following the science” by endorsing the advice of these health organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a unique moment where vaccine information from federal health leaders leaves important information gaps for Minnesotans,” Cunningham said. “These independent medical associations have all looked at the science and concluded that COVID-19 vaccine is safe, effective and important for people across the lifespan.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="https://kstp.com/health-medical/as-trump-administration-clamps-down-on-vaccines-walz-signs-order-to-expand-access/"&gt;As Trump administration clamps down on vaccines, Walz signs order to expand access&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MDH’s COVID-19 vaccine guidance, which includes &lt;a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/immunize/hcp/pharmacists.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;standing orders for pharmacists&lt;/a&gt;, comes after Gov.

Mostly, he blamed parents. They raised the kids in what he called &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1111%2Fj.1939-0025.1949.tb05441.x" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1111%2Fj.1939-0025.1949.tb05441.x"&gt;“emotional refrigerators.”&lt;/a&gt; A Time magazine piece on Kanner’s theories was titled &lt;a href="https://time.com/archive/6600845/medicine-frosted-children/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://time.com/archive/6600845/medicine-frosted-children/"&gt;“Frosted Children,”&lt;/a&gt; and told a story about kids who seemed “normal” at birth, but then became “apathetic, withdrawn, happiest when left alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;With the exception of the Time piece, Kanner mostly (according to Steve Silberman’s magisterial history of autism, &lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/310415/neurotribes-by-steve-silberman-foreword-by-oliver-sacks/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/310415/neurotribes-by-steve-silberman-foreword-by-oliver-sacks/"&gt;“Neurotribes”&lt;/a&gt;) published his theories in academic journals. Over the next few decades, Bruno Bettelheim, another child psychiatrist, publicized the idea that non-nurturing mothers (and to some extent perfectionist fathers) were to blame for autism. Bettelheim’s bestselling book, “The Empty Fortress,” which was published in 1967, blamed autism on parents who deserted their children emotionally, caring for their body, but not their soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;The “refrigerator mother” myth went viral, as we’d say now, and was used as a justification for taking children away from their parents and subjecting the kids to ever-harsher treatments. It took decades for the myth to go away, but now the Trump administration is poised to start a new cycle in which moms are once again blamed for their kids’ autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;At the Charlie Kirk memorial service on Sunday, President Donald Trump announced that &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/09/21/donald-trump-autism-charlie-kirk-memorial/86284828007/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/09/21/donald-trump-autism-charlie-kirk-memorial/86284828007/"&gt;“we found an answer”&lt;/a&gt; about the causes of autism.

In reality, the questions about autism and vaccines and autism and acetaminophen have been asked and answered.” That, pending new evidence, should be the end of the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Star Tribune</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 19:57:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxOU0oxb0FHTlM4cVV5eDNjRHljVDFUX1ZFSDZ3V291cjdIU2N5X3U5QkkxVnJSSEEyU1FpRDVuRkc5Z3ZEWWJwZzd1VW5RM0dsTnV3U3BHOUxrZnB4SWw2YTBMUnZmaUpiTjFORmtVR0Q3THlRSm9PQjBYQURiM0xVUA</guid></item><item><title>减肥注射：研究表明开始和停止的危险- KSL.com</title><link>https://www.ksl.com/article/51376600/weight-loss-shots-research-indicates-dangers-from-starting-and-stopping</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both starting and stopping this drug can be dangerous. Not only is the research clear about this but Dr. Roberts DC, at &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=weightlossshots-sep25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Heath Utah&lt;/a&gt;, is on the front lines helping prevent and resolve side effects. He reports seeing some of the problems patients are experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such case involved a 16-year-old girl. Roberts says, "She came into my clinic with excruciating pain. She couldn't even drink water without severe abdominal distress. Even though she was on Semaglutide for only a short time, the pain persisted for six months after she stopped injecting it. That's when she came to see me. Fortunately with care, her pain resolved within a few weeks. Incredibly she lost no weight throughout the whole ordeal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some patients aren't so lucky. Their symptoms are more severe or longer lasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: N F/peopleimages.com/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Serious side effects of starting GLP-1 Agonists&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/09/health/report-ozempic-and-other-weight-loss-drugs-linked-to-162-us-deaths/#:~:text=Weight%20loss%20shots%20like%20Ozempic,over%20the%20past%20six%20months" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; in the New York Post, since 2018, a total of 10,000 serious or life-threatening reactions have been reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database (FAERS).  And sadly, medical professionals and manufacturers have reported that these shots were a factor in 162 deaths. The number of these deaths rose by an astonishing 40% over a recent six month period as more and more people started using them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts says, "The reality is that the risk of death while taking these drugs is probably no greater than many other very common drugs. This just underscores the general principle that there are inherent risks in taking any kind of medication."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9192250/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;1997 study&lt;/a&gt; unfortunately found that, more often than not, doctors fail to tell their patients about the risks. So Roberts encourages patients to take on the responsibility of informing themselves, weighing the risks and considering all their options before taking a drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a618008.html#:~:text=Semaglutide%20injection%20may%20increase%20the,swallowing;%20or%20shortness%20of%20breath" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Semaglutide label&lt;/a&gt; lists the following potential side effects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pancreatitis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thyroid tumors, including cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Severe gastrointestinal disease such as stomach paralysis and intestinal blockage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bloating, severe constipation, nausea, and vomiting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acute kidney injury.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hypoglycemia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gallbladder disease including Gallstones and inflammation of the gallbladder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allergic reactions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vision changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rapid or pounding heartbeat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suicidal behavior and ideation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recent studies have found other concerning side effects not listed on the label. The following represent a couple of these studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38937282/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; reported in the journal, Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism, up to 60% of weight lost on Liraglutide is lean muscle mass, which can weaken physical function and slow metabolism. "That means that for every three pounds you lose, almost two of them could be from muscle," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2820255#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2025 population study&lt;/a&gt; reported in JAMA Ophthalmology found there is approximately a threefold increased risk of a sudden vision loss called non-arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/clinical-trials-may-not-differentiate-data-show-women-more-2025a1000lb2?form=fpf" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2025 article&lt;/a&gt; in Medscape reported FAERS analysis found incidences of anosmia, (loss of smell), dysgeusia (altered taste), tinnitus (ringing in the ears), dysphonia (voice changes), hearing disabilities and gastroesophageal reflux disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Kyrylo Ryzhov/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stopping GLP-1 Agonists: Brace for weight regain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're thinking about stopping GLP-1 agonists, be prepared for what's likely to happen. Research published in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism showed that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35441470/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;327 participants in the study&lt;/a&gt; regained two thirds of their weight within a year after discontinuing the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537024000543" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;research published in Sciencedirect&lt;/a&gt; showed that the weight people regain after the shots has a higher fat-to-muscle ratio, leading to a lowered metabolic rate and increased metabolic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anyone coming off these drugs must understand this near-certain outcome if they want to prevent it," Roberts says. "If people coming off the medications will treat the drugs as a jump start to optimal health and weight, rather than the means to it and then take certain steps, they can maintain the weight loss and continue to lose weight if necessary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to maintain weight loss after the shots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first step is to accept the fact that there is no short cut to optimal health and weight," Roberts says. "The laws of health cannot be circumvented with any kind of medication. You may have lost some weight with the shots, but it will all come back with a vengeance unless you adhere to those laws."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second step is to identify any underlying health issues that may be causing your stubborn weight or contributing to conditions that cause it. "Depression, insomnia, hormone imbalances, bad bacteria in the gut, liver/gallbladder problems, insulin resistance, leptin resistance, toxins and deficiencies can all contribute to both weight gain and stubborn weight," Roberts says. &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=weightlossshots-sep25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;At Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;, it is the first order of business to identify these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each patient undergoes a specialized non-invasive body scan. The scan is a functional state assessment of the body which provides an immediate overview of the patient's physiology, stress, fatigue, risk factors, and potential underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to every appointment at Health Utah, patients fill out a proprietary questionnaire that also can identify these underlying problems. The questionnaire is the result of Roberts' 30 years of experience and research. There is almost always a perfect correlation between the results of the scan and the questionnaire. Roberts uses both of these to guide him through a 40-minute consultation and evaluation with each patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third step is to address all underlying health conditions through a customized protocol of care. A care plan can include therapies, supplementation, hypnotherapy, coaching and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final step is to create a customized, healthy and sustainable food plan. Roberts says, "The shots work partially because they reduce the calories you eat. But the shots ultimately fail, like almost every other diet, precisely because they reduce the calories you eat. Calorie reduction never works long term because your body's metabolism slows down when threatened by reduced calories."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Health Utah they don't cut calories, count calories, count macros or points. They don't have you cut out whole categories of food like carbs. They don't tell you to eat all meat or all fat or give you any other faddish diet. They customized your food plan according to your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Take these steps and you will likely be able to maintain the weight you lost while on the shots and get healthier at the same time, something the shots could never do," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Special offer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any health or weight loss journey, it is essential to have the help of family and friends. In a British study, researchers found that both men and women had almost twice as much success losing weight when they did it with a partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=weightlossshots-sep25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; is offering this, their most popular weight loss package, for $59 for two people. You and a friend can get tested, receive a 17-page report, take the proprietary survey and get a consultation with Dr. Roberts. The scan alone is normally $300 for one person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Call (801) 609-3478 or visit &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=weightlossshots-sep25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; today to schedule your appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The opinions and conclusions expressed in this article are the sponsor's own and do not reflect the views or opinions of KSL.com.

&lt;p&gt;POLICE Service Social and Welfare Association treasurer Sgt Jason Johnson says he hopes the association’s new health and wellness initiative will encourage police officers to take better care of themselves, both physically and mentally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking with Newsday at the Vehicle Management Corporation of Trinidad and Tobago (VMCOTT) compound in Beetham on September 23, Johnson said while the health fair was not a new concept to the association, it was the largest of its kind ever hosted, and he hoped the initiative would become an annual one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_1179961" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1179961" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-1179961" src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/24426813-1024x461.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-1179961" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Police officers visiting various health booths at the Police Welfare Association health fair at the VMCOTT compound, Beetham, on September 23. - Photo by Joey Bartlett&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s the first time we are attempting an initiative of this magnitude. It’s a partnership involving corporate stakeholders, including Guardian Life and Blue Waters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several tents were set up for the fair, offering a range of health-focused services. Despite the bad weather, several officers, including some on duty, visited the booths and accessed services such as blood pressure and blood glucose testing, vision screening, massage therapy, and herbal medicine consultations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239531467-0"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_1179960" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1179960" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-1179960" src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/24426816-1024x461.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-1179960" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Police officers at various health booths at the Police Welfare Association health fair at the VMCOTT compound, Beetham, on September 23, - Photo by Joey Bartlett&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson stressed the goal of the initiative was to bring attention to the health of officers and to highlight issues many may not even realise they are facing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s really an effort to bring awareness to officers about their health and underlying issues, to shine a light on those issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Newsday spoke with Johnson around 11 am, the turnout was already encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s still early in the morning, but we’ve been seeing a good amount of foot traffic. Inside, we have several services available: a massage therapist, blood glucose testing, vision screening, and dental screening.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_1179962" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1179962" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-1179962" src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/24426814-1024x461.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-1179962" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Police officers visiting various health booths at the Police Welfare Association health fair at the VMCOTT compound, Beetham, on September 23, 2025. - Photo by Joey Bartlett&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fair, which began around 9 am, was scheduled to continue until 5 pm to accommodate officers working different shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We also have cancer screening and several other health services available to members of the police service and other extended services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson said one of his biggest concerns is the number of officers who suffer or die from lifestyle-related illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239585826-0"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve seen officers dying from complications related to diabetes, strokes, and heart disease. That’s why this initiative is so important, to raise awareness and encourage preventive care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He recalled the recent loss of the association’s last Welfare Committee chairman, who died from a medical condition, as a catalyst for launching the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That was the impetus for us to say, ‘Let’s do something.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We want officers to understand that their health care is their welfare. We’re encouraging them to get regular check-ups and be proactive. Preventive care can ensure a better quality of life, both on and off duty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the fair was largely health-focused, Johnson emphasised mental health was also a priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have services focused on mental well-being. Our police doctor is here to provide counselling and support as needed. We’ve also included massage therapy to help create a relaxing and supportive environment. So we’re not only addressing physical health but mental wellness as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a final message to officers, Johnson encouraged all ranks to prioritise their well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know the job is physically and mentally demanding, but even dedicating ten to 15 minutes a day to exercise, relaxation, or therapy can make a big difference. We want to see healthier, more balanced officers, both for themselves and for the communities they serve.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;What gives rise to human  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/consciousness" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73104" data-postid="175128" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;consciousness&lt;/a&gt;? Are some parts of the brain more important than others?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists began tackling these questions in more depth about 35 years ago. Researchers have made progress, but the mystery of consciousness remains very much alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106333"&gt;recently published article&lt;/a&gt;, I reviewed over 100 years of neuroscience research to see if some brain regions are more important than others for consciousness. What I found suggests scientists who study consciousness may have been undervaluing the most ancient regions of human brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consciousness is usually &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2016.22"&gt;defined by neuroscientists&lt;/a&gt; as the ability to have subjective experience, such as the experience of tasting an apple or of seeing the redness of its skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leading &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-does-consciousness-work-duelling-scientists-tested-two-big-theories-but-found-no-winner-255610"&gt;theories of consciousness&lt;/a&gt; suggest that the outer layer of the human brain, called the cortex (in blue in figure 1), is fundamental to consciousness. This is mostly composed of the neocortex, which is newer in our evolutionary history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human subcortex (figure 1, brown/beige), underneath the neocortex, has not changed much in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438824000400?via%3Dihub"&gt;last 500 million years&lt;/a&gt;. It is thought to be like electricity for a TV, necessary for consciousness, but &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2016.22"&gt;not enough&lt;/a&gt; on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is another part of the brain that some neuroscientific theories of consciousness state &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2016.44"&gt;is irrelevant&lt;/a&gt; for consciousness. This is the cerebellum, which is also older than the neocortex and looks like a little brain tucked in the back of the skull (figure 1, purple).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175133" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175133" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/HumanBrainCerebellumCortexSubcortex-e1758598683378.jpeg" alt="Diagram of human brain showing the positions of the Cortex, Subcortex and Cerebellum" class="wp-image-175133 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175133" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Figure 1, the human brain (made with the assistance of AI). (Peter Coppola/CC BY SA 4.0)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain activity and brain networks are disrupted in unconsciousness (like in a coma). &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106333"&gt;These changes&lt;/a&gt; can be seen in the cortex, subcortex, and cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What brain stimulation reveals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of my analysis, I looked at studies showing what happens to consciousness when brain activity is changed, for example, by &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32632334/"&gt;applying electrical currents&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94051-5#Sec2"&gt;magnetic pulses&lt;/a&gt; to brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These experiments in humans and animals showed that altering activity in any of these three parts of the brain can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106333"&gt;alter consciousness&lt;/a&gt;. Changing the activity of the neocortex can change your sense of self, make you hallucinate, or affect your judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changing the subcortex may have extreme effects. We can &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199905133401905"&gt;induce depression&lt;/a&gt;, wake a monkey from anaesthesia, or knock a mouse unconscious. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106333"&gt;Even stimulating the cerebellum&lt;/a&gt;, long considered irrelevant, can change your conscious sensory perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this research does not allow us to reach strong conclusions about where consciousness comes from, as stimulating one brain region may affect another region. Like unplugging the TV from the socket, we might be changing the conditions that support consciousness, but not the mechanisms of consciousness itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I looked at some evidence from patients to see if it would help resolve this dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damage from physical trauma or lack of oxygen to the brain can disrupt your experience. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106333"&gt;Injury to the neocortex&lt;/a&gt; may &lt;a href="https://karger.com/ene/article-abstract/84/3/157/125434/Cognitive-and-Behavioral-Disorders-in-Patients?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;make you think&lt;/a&gt; your hand is not yours, fail to notice things on one side of your visual field, or become more impulsive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People born without the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4614135/"&gt;cerebellum&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5964834"&gt;the front of their cortex&lt;/a&gt;, can still appear conscious and live quite normal lives. However, damaging the cerebellum &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945211002061?via%3Dihub"&gt;later in life&lt;/a&gt; can trigger hallucinations or change your emotions completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harm to the most ancient parts of our brain can directly cause unconsciousness (&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/126/7/1524/299341?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;amp;login=false"&gt;although some people recover&lt;/a&gt;) or death. However, like electricity for a TV, the subcortex may be just keeping the newer cortex "online", which may be giving rise to consciousness. So I wanted to know whether, alternatively, there is evidence that the most ancient regions are sufficient for consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are rare cases of children being born without most or all of their neocortex. According to medical textbooks, these people should be in a permanent vegetative state. However, there &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106333"&gt;are reports&lt;/a&gt; that these people can feel upset, play, recognize people, or show enjoyment of music. This suggests that they are having some sort of conscious experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These reports are striking evidence that suggests maybe the oldest parts of the brain are enough for basic consciousness. Or maybe, when you are born without a cortex, the older parts of the brain adapt to take on some of the roles of the newer parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some extreme experiments on animals that can help us reach a conclusion. Across mammals – from rats to cats to monkeys – surgically removing the neocortex leaves them &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-8749.1999.tb00621.x"&gt;still capable&lt;/a&gt; of an astonishing number of things. They can play, show emotions, groom themselves, parent their young, and even learn. Surprisingly, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763425003343?via%3Dihub"&gt;even adult animals&lt;/a&gt; that underwent this surgery showed similar behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, the evidence challenges the view that the cortex is necessary for consciousness, as most major theories of consciousness suggest. It seems that the oldest parts of the brain are enough for some basic forms of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newer parts of the brain – as well as the cerebellum – seem to expand and refine your consciousness. This means we may have to review our theories of consciousness. In turn, this may influence patient care as well as how we think about animal rights. In fact, consciousness might be more common than we realized.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264609/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;The US Department of Health and Human Services yesterday &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/us/american-politics/article/tylenol-autism-trump-rfk-pregnant-fever-n0w3fv7t0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that pregnant women should avoid acetaminophen — known in Britain as paracetamol, and the active ingredient in Tylenol — because of concerns it may increase the risk of autism in unborn children. But millions of mothers use paracetamol to manage pain and fevers during their pregnancies because it’s the only drug available to them to safely do so. Or at least, that’s what they’ve been told for the past few decades, but apparently no longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent1" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HHS’ rationale for the new Tylenol warning is based on a systematic review led by Harvard Dean of Public Health Andrea Baccarelli. Dr. Baccarelli’s &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/autism-announcement-fact-sheet.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; contends that there is a “strong, consistent association between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and ADHD/ASD/other NDDs”. The review emphasised that this result was exceptionally robust, that it stood strong in studies controlling for bundles of different confounders, with negative control exposure periods, and with propensity score matching. The only problem is that &lt;a href="https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/you-cant-just-control-for-things" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;none of these methods&lt;/a&gt; are reliable and the authors actually ignored some good evidence that contradicts their conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main failing point of the review is that its authors knew about good evidence in the form of &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406"&gt;sibling control studies&lt;/a&gt; — studies where scientists compare a sibling who is exposed to Tylenol &lt;i&gt;in utero &lt;/i&gt;to a sibling who wasn’t exposed to it — and they ignored those results. But those studies were the strongest; it just happens to be the case that those studies didn’t find anything alarming. To me, that seems like the correct explanation for why the authors were &lt;a href="https://www.cremieux.xyz/i/174283509/does-tylenol-cause-autism" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;so gung-ho&lt;/a&gt; to attack them on spurious grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the largest, highest-quality &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;, researchers used almost 2.5 million births from Sweden between 1995 and 2019, used great measures of Tylenol exposure in a country where most Tylenol use is &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bcpt.13003" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;by prescription&lt;/a&gt;, and they found much the same as the other non-causal studies: mothers who used more Tylenol during pregnancy have children with autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders more often. But they went further than replicating that purely correlational association. In fact, they showed that, when comparing differentially exposed siblings, the one exposed to Tylenol was no more likely to have any disorder than the one who was not exposed. In other words, the association isn’t causal at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="94" data-end="388"&gt;The review was plagued by non-sequiturs. It cited weak evidence as if it were strong. The authors failed to quantitatively synthesise the findings of the studies they referenced. Worse, they botched the table entries and even cited studies in ways directly contradicted by the studies themselves. The review was lazy, but it ostensibly supports what some people really want to believe: that Tylenol causes autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of this bastardised faux-science masquerading as real information, millions of pregnant women will be scared into avoiding Tylenol or any brand of paracetamol, even when it might be the drug they need. Mothers who need to break a fever or manage pain have no alternatives: opiates aren’t acceptable, and Ibuprofen isn’t safe before foetuses have undergone about two trimesters of growth. If it were true that Tylenol is causing autism, then there might be some debate to be had about the risk-reward calculus for letting pregnant women use it, but there isn’t. The science is abundantly clear: Tylenol &lt;i&gt;does not &lt;/i&gt;cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent2" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;That is one reason, aside from cultural and religious considerations, some people kick off their shoes at the door. But while gross, the germs on your shoes are unlikely to cause illness, some experts said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In a small, widely cited study, researchers found that fecal bacteria such as &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, which can make you sick if they are ingested or make their way into a cut in your skin, were commonly present on the bottoms of shoes. And when those shoes came into contact with clean flooring, 90-99 percent of the bacteria were transferred to it. (The study was not peer reviewed and was funded by a shoe company marketing washable shoes.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The first three or four steps when you walk in the house are the most contaminated on the floor because you’re bringing all that stuff from outside and walking on the floors,” said Charles Gerba, a professor of microbiology at the University of Arizona and co-author of the study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Other studies have reported that &lt;i&gt;Clostridium difficile&lt;/i&gt;, a bacterium that can cause severe diarrhea, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can also be found on the bottoms of shoes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We live in a germy world,” and bacteria and viruses can be found on nearly any object, including our shoes, said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases and preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. But there aren’t any instances in the scientific literature of pathogens being transmitted from the soles of shoes to noses or mouths in high enough numbers to initiate infections, he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“That’s why we don’t have public health recommendations that people sanitize their shoes,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Schaffner, who sometimes wears street shoes in his own home, said it is more notable that “our hands can pick up germs, and then we touch our mouths, noses and eyes. That’s the mode of inoculation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Going shoeless at home has another benefit, some experts said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;When you wear shoes all the time, it may lead to deconditioning of the deeper muscles of the foot, said Amiethab Aiyer, an orthopedic surgeon specializing in foot and ankle conditions at Johns Hopkins. “Their relative strength and relative conditioning could lapse over time,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“From the perspective of maintaining strength and conditioning of the musculature in the feet, and to avoid the germ elements, it may be helpful to not wear shoes around the house,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;From a cultural perspective, Aiyer, who is Indian American, said he and his family do not wear shoes in the house, both for cleanliness and out of respect for the home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;However, some people shouldn’t go barefoot at home. For example, if you have poor circulation or conditions such as neuropathy, which is nerve damage in the feet that can be caused by diabetes or chemotherapy, it can lead to the loss of protective sensation that may affect your ability to detect objects under foot, Aiyer said. Additionally, people who are at increased risk of falling may need traction or improved perceived balance that shoes can provide, he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="flex align_items_base justify_space_between heading-container"&gt;&lt;h3 id="what_else_you_should_know" class="heading | bold font_secondary gutter_20_0--mobile

However, if you are concerned about dirt or germs, here are tips from experts:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list |  list_unstyled list_counter_reset unordered font_size_18"&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hand-wash shoes with soap and warm water to remove dirt and debris, particularly from the soles of shoes. Mix water with a small amount of dish soap and a washing powder (sodium carbonate), and give the bottoms “a good thorough scrub with a strong bristle brush,” said Zachary Pozniak, co-owner of Jeeves New York, a dry cleaning and shoe cleaning and repair service. Insoles that are removable can be handwashed and air-dried before placing them back in the shoe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Disinfect the soles with a spray or wipe to help kill germs. Look for products registered with the Environmental Protection Agency to kill particular pathogens such as norovirus, a highly contagious germ that can cause severe gastrointestinal illness. For better control when using disinfectant sprays, spray a clean towel with the solution and wipe the soles of the shoes rather than spraying directly onto the shoe, Pozniak said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Machine wash shoes only when the manufacturer label states so. Before washing shoes in the machine, pretreat stains by hand in the sink, Pozniak said. Do not wash materials such as leather or suede.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Air dry unless otherwise specified by the manufacturer.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Clothes dryers can ruin shoes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The bottom line: Our shoes can carry germs into the house, but they alone are unlikely to cause illness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Boston Globe</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 18:33:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTFBxY19mS05OOXcyRC1tZl9vMS1HQ0VmWXJXdk41VVdySTVBdFRpaHl6eW5xVnpuR2hQd1Fsd3JCVUl5UjZfTDR5c09vbGktTy1jRV9SNmFySGg4a2FyMC0xWDdhMlVKT1hCMEI0a2xOTGtDZUVONXY0</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心的研究人员表示，美国的耐药“噩梦细菌”病例正在上升-哥伦比亚广播公司新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nightmare-bacteria-drug-resistant-cases-increase-cdc-report/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infection rates from drug-resistant "nightmare bacteria" rose almost 70% between 2019 and 2023, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-02404" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria that are difficult to treat due to the so-called NDM gene primarily drove the increase, CDC researchers wrote in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/ANNALS-25-02404" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;an article published Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Only two antibiotics work against those infections, and the drugs are expensive and must be administered through an IV, researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria with the gene were once considered exotic, linked to a small number of patients who received medical care overseas. Though the numbers are still small, the rate of U.S. cases jumped more than fivefold in recent years, the researchers reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The rise of NDMs in the U.S. is a grave danger and very worrisome," said David Weiss, an Emory University infectious diseases researcher, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's likely many people are unrecognized carriers of the drug-resistant bacteria, which could lead to community spread, the CDC scientists said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may play out in doctors' offices across the country, as infections long considered routine and easy to treat — like urinary tract infections — could become chronic problems, said Dr. Maroya Walters, one of the report's authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/drug-resistant-infections-new-antibiotics-needed-high-cost-preventing-development/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Antimicrobial resistance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; occurs when germs such as bacteria and fungi gain the power to fight off the drugs designed to kill them. The misuse of antibiotics was a big reason for the rise — unfinished or unnecessary prescriptions that didn't kill the germs made them stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the CDC has drawn attention to "&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/could-antibiotic-resistant-superbugs-become-a-bigger-killer-than-cancer-60-minutes-2019-04-21/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;nightmare bacteria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. That includes carbapenems, a class of antibiotics considered a last resort for treatment of serious infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers drew data from 29 states that do the necessary testing and reporting of carbapenem-resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They counted 4,341 cases of carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections from those states in 2023, with 1,831 of them the NDM variety. The researchers did not say how many of the infected people died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate of carbapenem-resistant infections rose from just under 2 per 100,000 people in 2019 to more than 3 per 100,000 in 2023 — an increase of 69%. But the rate of NDM cases rose from around 0.25 to about 1.35 — an increase of 460%, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A researcher not involved in the study said the increase is probably related to the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know that there was a huge surge in antibiotic use during the pandemic, so this likely is reflected in increasing drug resistance," said Dr. Jason Burnham, a Washington University researcher, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC's count is only a partial picture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many states are not fully testing and reporting cases. Even in states that do, cases tend to be among hospital patients sick enough to warrant special testing. Many hospitals also aren't able to do the testing needed to detect certain forms of genetic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC researchers did not have data from some of the most populous states, including California, Florida, New York and Texas, which means the absolute number of U.S. infections "is definitely underestimated," Burnham said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the first study to report a rise. A CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7423a2.htm" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published in June noted an increase in NDM cases in New York City between 2019 and 2024. &lt;/p&gt;

The next morning, you feel groggy and irritable. That sugary pastry or greasy breakfast sandwich suddenly looks more appealing than your usual yogurt and berries. By the afternoon, chips or candy from the break room call your name. This isn’t just about willpower. Your brain, short on rest, is nudging you toward quick, high-calorie fixes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a reason why this cycle repeats itself so predictably. Research shows that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41574-022-00747-7"&gt;insufficient sleep disrupts hunger signals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smrv.2021.101514"&gt;weakens self-control&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2018.02.010"&gt;impairs glucose metabolism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23539"&gt;increases your risk of weight gain&lt;/a&gt;. These changes &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0250-18.2018"&gt;can occur rapidly&lt;/a&gt;, even after a single night of poor sleep, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14926"&gt;can become more harmful over time&lt;/a&gt; if left unaddressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sTqquL0AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;neurologist specializing in sleep science&lt;/a&gt; and its impact on health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep deprivation affects millions. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than one-third of U.S. adults &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/data-research/facts-stats/adults-sleep-facts-and-stats.html"&gt;regularly get less than seven hours of sleep&lt;/a&gt; per night. Nearly three-quarters of adolescents &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/data-research/facts-stats/high-school-students-sleep-facts-and-stats.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;fall short of the recommended 8-10 hours sleep&lt;/a&gt; during the school week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While anyone can suffer from sleep loss, essential workers and first responders, including nurses, firefighters and emergency personnel, are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.i5210"&gt;especially vulnerable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm13154505"&gt;due to night shifts and rotating schedules&lt;/a&gt;. These patterns disrupt the body’s internal clock and are linked to increased cravings, poor eating habits and elevated risks for obesity and metabolic disease. Fortunately, even a few nights of consistent, high-quality sleep can help rebalance key systems and start to reverse some of these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How sleep deficits disrupt hunger hormones&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your body regulates hunger through a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMra2402679"&gt;hormonal feedback loop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2025.171367"&gt;involving two key hormones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghrelin, produced primarily in the stomach, signals that you are hungry, while leptin, which is produced in the fat cells, tells your brain that you are full. Even one night of restricted sleep &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23616"&gt;increases the release of ghrelin and decreases leptin&lt;/a&gt;, which leads to greater hunger and reduced satisfaction after eating. This shift is driven by changes in how the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23616"&gt;body regulates hunger&lt;/a&gt; and stress. Your brain becomes less responsive to fullness signals, while at the same time &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.13051"&gt;ramping up stress hormones&lt;/a&gt; that can increase cravings and appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes are not subtle. In controlled lab studies, healthy adults reported &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2869.2008.00662.x"&gt;increased hunger and stronger cravings&lt;/a&gt; for calorie-dense foods after sleeping only four to five hours. The effect worsens with ongoing sleep deficits, which can lead to a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.13051"&gt;chronically elevated appetite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why the brain shifts into reward mode&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep loss changes how your brain evaluates food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imaging studies show that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms3259"&gt;after just one night of sleep deprivation&lt;/a&gt;, the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for decision-making and impulse control, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.111.027383"&gt;has reduced activity&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0250-18.2018"&gt;reward-related areas such as the amygdala&lt;/a&gt; and the nucleus accumbens, a part of the brain that drives motivation and reward-seeking, become &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsx125"&gt;more reactive to tempting food cues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, your brain becomes more tempted by junk food and less capable of resisting it. Participants in sleep deprivation studies not only rated high-calorie foods as more desirable but were also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.111.027383"&gt;more likely to choose them&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of how hungry they actually felt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Your metabolism slows, leading to increased fat storage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is also critical for blood sugar control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re well rested, your body efficiently uses insulin to move sugar out of your bloodstream and into your cells for energy. But even one night of partial sleep can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2009-2430"&gt;reduce insulin sensitivity by up to 25%&lt;/a&gt;, leaving more sugar circulating in your blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your body can’t process sugar effectively, it’s more likely to convert it into fat. This contributes to weight gain, especially around the abdomen. Over time, poor sleep is associated with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000444"&gt;higher risk for Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/metabolic-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20351916"&gt;group of health issues&lt;/a&gt; such as high blood pressure, belly fat and high blood sugar that raise the risk for heart disease and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of this, sleep loss raises cortisol, your body’s main stress hormone. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2013-4254"&gt;Elevated cortisol encourages fat storage&lt;/a&gt;, especially in the abdominal region, and can further disrupt appetite regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sleep is your metabolic reset button&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a culture that glorifies hustle and late nights, sleep is often treated as optional. But your body doesn’t see it that way. Sleep is not downtime. It is active, essential repair. It is when your brain recalibrates hunger and reward signals, your hormones reset and your metabolism stabilizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just one or two nights of quality sleep can begin to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.00301.2013"&gt;undo the damage from prior sleep loss&lt;/a&gt; and restore your body’s natural balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the next time you find yourself reaching for junk food after a short night, recognize that your biology is not failing you. It is reacting to stress and fatigue. The most effective way to restore balance isn’t a crash diet or caffeine. It’s sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is not a luxury. It is your most powerful tool for appetite control, energy regulation and long-term health.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/255726/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/255726/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

But one reported infection in the Bear River Health Department district, which encompasses Box Elder, Cache and Rich counties, shows the highly contagious disease has spread north months after the outbreak began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Officials say people in the area may have been exposed to the virus at the Chick-fil-A off of State Road 165 in Providence, in Cache County, if they were there between 6:30-9 p.m. on Sep. 11. Those at the Budge Clinic, 1350 N 500 East in Logan, between 3-6:30 p.m. on Sep. 15 may have also been exposed, according to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The department says those exposed at&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the restaurant should watch for symptoms — like a high fever and cough, or a rash — through Oct. 2, and those exposed at the clinic should be on the lookout through Oct. 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Cache County is the fourth county that the department has confirmed cases in during the current outbreak, which began in June with a single&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;case in Utah County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Of the confirmed measles cases, 25 have been in the Southwest Utah district (consisting of Beaver, Garfield, Iron, Kane and Washington Counties), three in the Southeast district (Carbon, Emery, Grand and San Juan counties), seven in Utah County and one in the Bear River district, according to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Three of those districts — Bear River, Utah County and Southwest Utah — have also seen &lt;a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/09/19/measles-found-utah-wastewater/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/09/19/measles-found-utah-wastewater/"&gt;measles in their wastewater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;within the past month, the health department reports. These other districts without confirmed cases have also found measles in sewage:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Davis County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Salt Lake County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summit County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TriCounty, which consists of Daggett, Duchesne and Uintah counties&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Wastewater in the Central Utah and the San Juan districts has not been tested, according to the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Dr. Leisha Nolen, the state’s epidemiologist, said the wastewater&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;results mean people should be aware that measles could be found in areas of the state without confirmed cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;There are active symptom watches in effect for those who visited the Chick-fil-A and clinic in Cache County, as well as for individuals who were at Water Canyon High School, in Hildale in Washington County, on Sep. 3. That watch in southern Utah ends Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;As of Sep. 16, there were 1,491 confirmed measles cases in 42 jurisdictions across the United States, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt; Last year, the CDC says the U.S. saw only 285 cases. Weekly cases throughout the nation spiked this year in March, according to CDC data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Measles symptoms typically appear within one to two weeks of exposure, according to the health department, and can consist of a high fever and cough, runny nose or red eyes. After four days of fever, the department says a rash will normally appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Those who develop symptoms should stay away from other people and call their healthcare provider before going to their doctor, the health department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The best way to prevent measles, according to the health department, is to get the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine from their healthcare provider. The vaccine is 97% effective in people who receive two doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Salt Lake Tribune</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 17:57:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE4zNEdzQ1RteEZ1ZjhmcFozODIybEhlOG9OZFJsNjg5OF9XYUxRQXJjYUtzZEQyU3Bac2daLXF5NFNPLUhSM01jMlI0RF90SW1rcG15U0ZyRm9vd2gzME9QQjdLN0tiYnBLb0NRd04tMXhzWm40am00cmdROA</guid></item><item><title>什么是“复古漫步” ？最新的趋势专家说，可以预防痴呆症-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15125737/retro-walking-trend-prevent-dementia-cognition-ucla.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Leading doctors are highlighting how an unusual walking technique could help boost memory and stave off dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-c6f67260-989e-11f0-891b-c9d2a3dca2d6"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/los-angeles/index.html" id="mol-c6f70ea0-989e-11f0-891b-c9d2a3dca2d6"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; Drs Eve Glazier and Elizabeth Ko say that multiple studies have shown that walking backwards, or 'retro walking', may improve cognition and boost activity in the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain responsible for decision-making, problem-solving and working memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They write: 'That is the region of the brain associated with problem-solving, logic and making decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In one particularly intriguing study, participants who simply visualized the act of walking backward, but were actually sitting still, improved their scores on a memory test.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exact scientific mechanism behind how retro walking improves cognition isn't fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, researchers hypothesize it is linked to the brain working harder or in a more complex way to process and carry out the unfamiliar movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have shown benefits from as little as 10 to 15 minutes of daily backward walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Glazier and Dr Ko note that caution is needed to avoid injury due to potential balance issues or obstacles that are tricky to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Eve Glazier and Dr Elizabeth Ko who are based at UCLA in California say that multiple studies have shown how walking backwards, or 'retro walking', may improve cognition and boost activity in the prefrontal cortex&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

At the end of the study, the average score increased by almost three points, from 25 pre-test to 27.7 post-test. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A score of 25 indicates that further assessments are required and a person may have mild cognitive impairment, a precursor to dementia. A score of 27 or higher is considered normal or healthy with no signs of cognitive decline.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers concluded: 'Cognitive decline is a major concern in the geriatric population, with physical exercise being a well-established intervention for cognitive preservation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'The significant improvement in MoCA scores from pre-test to post-test suggests that retro-walking positively influences cognitive function. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Previous research has indicated that engaging in dual-task exercises, such as walking while maintaining balance, stimulates cognitive processing and enhances executive function. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Retro-walking demands increased attention and coordination, potentially explaining the observed cognitive improvements.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers also highlight that cognitive impairment is becoming more common among older adults, driven by the aging global population and the increasing prevalence of age-related neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is one of the most common forms of dementia and mostly affects adults over the age of 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;About 7million people in the US 65 and older live with the condition, and over 100,000 die from it annually. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Alzheimer's Association estimates that by 2050, nearly 13 million Americans will be living with the disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with having a beneficial effect on cognitive health, retro walking has also been found to have many other benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Glazier and Dr Ko wrote: '&lt;span&gt;It can strengthen the muscles in the back; increase strength and flexibility in the hamstrings; strengthen the ankles; improve balance, posture and coordination; and even ease lower back pain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Due to a decreased range of motion in the knees and hips, retro walking can be kinder to those joints.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Walking backward can also increase the energy you use by 40 percent, upping calorie burn. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And without being able to see in front of you, your body has to rely more on something called proprioception, the built-in sense of where you are in space. This can fine turn coordination and stability and strengthen your ability to focus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Better stability and balance is crucial in older adults as it can prevent falls and the potentially deadly complications that result.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What you eat &amp;amp; drink before &amp;amp; after your flu shot can make a difference in how you feel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay hydrated, load up on antioxidant-rich foods and pack a snack before your shot. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain hydration, eat for your symptoms and continue healthy habits after the shot. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It is estimated that at least 46 million Americans per year come down with the regular seasonal flu.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Some cases are more severe than others, but make no mistake, flu season will arrive before we know it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In case you were wondering, the fall season is the best time to get a flu shot, to bolster your immune system before the virus season really gets into full swing as the weather turns cold. "The flu shot, in combination with hand-washing, is among our best defenses against this highly contagious, and potentially frustrating, infectious disease," explains &lt;a href="https://providers.upmc.com/provider/Jonathan%20W%20Yadlosky/1321671" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jonathan Yadlosky, M.D.&lt;/a&gt; It is recommended that everyone age 6 months and older get vaccinated against flu annually, says &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/about-nfid/board-of-directors/patricia-a-stinchfield-ms-cpnp/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Patricia A. Stinchfield, RN, M.S., CPNP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You'll be protecting not only your own health, but also the health of those with whom you share a household, workplace or school, along with anyone you encounter as you go about your daily tasks and holiday gatherings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If the potential for post-shot pain has you on the fence about getting a flu shot, we'll coach you through how to feel your best each step of the way. We've broken down a few specific tips to act as your pre-shot starter pack. But there's no need to wait until you have a &lt;a href="https://www.vaccines.gov/find-vaccines/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;flu vaccine appointment&lt;/a&gt; (if you haven't booked one already) to start shifting your strategy, confirms &lt;a href="https://roxanaehsani.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Roxana Ehsani, RD, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Drink 16 Ounces More Water per Day &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; No need to overhaul your entire meal plan, Yadlosky advises: "A healthy and balanced diet along with a slight increase in hydration is all someone will really need to be nutritionally prepared."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Staying hydrated is important to your overall health, and is a key thing to focus on when planning for your vaccine," Stinchfield says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking enough H2O helps your body maintain a normal temperature, which may be particularly helpful leading up to a flu shot since fever is a possible side effect. The amount of water you need varies based on a number of factors (here's a rough &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7825445/how-much-water-should-you-drink-by-the-numbers/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;guideline for how much water you should drink&lt;/a&gt;), but "try to be intentional about drinking an extra glass or two of water each day leading up to your vaccine," Stinchfield adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you find it challenging to meet your mark, there are a few things you can do to make it more enjoyable to up your intake:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carry a water bottle with you and refill it throughout the day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infuse your water with citrus and/or herbs to perk up its flavor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest in a chic pitcher to keep within your line of sight when you open the fridge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider adding some &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/17576/8-hydrating-foods-to-help-you-meet-your-water-goals/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;hydrating foods&lt;/a&gt; to your menu to supplement what you sip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Prioritize Anti-Inflammatory Foods &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there's no one recipe ingredient, vitamin or mineral that can prevent disease, there are some foods and nutrients that can help support your immune system so it can perform at its peak and is better able to do its important job of fighting off foreign invaders like viruses and bacteria.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the best ways to "feed" your immune system is to lean into more anti-inflammatory foods. Beyond acting as part of your immunity Rx, this will also help reduce inflammation in the body pre- and post- shot, Ehsani says. Over time, following an anti-inflammatory diet can help reduce your risk for other chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes, too. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7595044/the-10-best-anti-inflammatory-foods-for-heart-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Anti-inflammatory foods&lt;/a&gt; may also help decrease &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7930160/inflammation-fatigue-heres-what-to-do-about-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;feelings of fatigue&lt;/a&gt; and possibly reduce your risk for headaches.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7965303/anti-inflammatory-comfort-food-meal-plan/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory comfort food meal plan&lt;/a&gt; is packed with fresh fruits and vegetables, healthy fats like fish and nuts, hearty whole grains and protein-packed beans, lentils and more. The comfort food factor will help calm any pre-shot stress, and the cozy recipes are ideal to savor as temperatures begin to dip.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Aim for Balanced and Colorful Meals and Snacks &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "It's important to note that the flu vaccine cannot cause flu illness. This is a common misconception. However, flu activity starts to ramp up in October and November, meaning it's a good time to give your immune system a boost with nutrient-rich meals at any time—and it's never too early to start this healthy strategy," Stinchfield says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the easiest ways to mix up your menu and maximize the amount of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants you're consuming is to focus on adding more color to your plate, Ehsani says. (BTW, we suggest adding these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7918735/fall-superfoods-to-support-your-immune-system/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;5 fall superfoods&lt;/a&gt; to your shopping list, since they can support your immune system during cold and flu season.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Fruits and veggies are among our most nutrient-dense foods, and most Americans are not consuming enough of them," Ehsani explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Setting a goal to include at least three different natural colors on your plate at each meal will go a long way to help support an overall stoked and strong immune system. Bonus: Fruits and veggies are packed with water, so will help hydrate you pre- and post-shot too, Ehsani adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Pack a Snack &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Receiving a flu vaccine can trigger anxiety among some individuals, Stinchfield says, which may, in turn, result in fainting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Having a snack and some water right before your vaccine has been shown to sometimes prevent anxiety-related fainting," she says. "Pack an easy snack and a water bottle just in case," to enjoy on your way to your flu shot.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Snag one of these healthy grab-and-go snacks, or whip up one of these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7824730/healthy-packable-snack-recipes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;24 dietitian-approved homemade, packable snacks&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A good balance of fluids and nutrients helps the immune system process the flu shot and begin to build protection, Yadlosky explains. Plus, one of the possible ripple effects of a flu shot is a slight headache. Being dehydrated can exacerbate said headache, says &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/laurenlovesnutrition/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lauren Manaker M.S., RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking adequate water (and a glass or two extra, if possible) the day before, the day of and the day after your flu shot is a good rule of thumb, she says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Add in Some Prebiotics and Probiotics &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The scientific jury is still out, but Manaker says that gut-healthy foods with pre- and probiotics may help make your vaccine more effective, according to some evidence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Aim to eat fruits, vegetables, whole grains, yogurt, kefir and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/281916/must-eat-fermented-foods-for-a-healthy-gut/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fermented foods&lt;/a&gt; (such as kimchi, sauerkraut and kombucha) to give your good gut bacteria a boost.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Stock Plain Foods &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While rare and almost always mild, another side effect of the flu vaccine is nausea, so it's never a bad idea to be prepared for an upset stomach, Stinchfield says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There aren't any foods that are necessarily off-limits after getting a flu shot, says Manaker. However, pantry staples like saltine crackers, pasta, and rice are wise choices if you're experiencing any nausea, as are bananas and avocados. Check out our complete primer on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7561593/easy-to-digest-foods/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;easy-to-digest-foods—plus what to skip&lt;/a&gt; for when your stomach feels "off."

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Within a few days of being vaccinated, you should be fully recovered from any of the possible rare and minor flu shot side effects.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_66-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "If you increased your water intake and incorporated more nutrient-rich foods in your diet, congratulations—and keep up the good work! These habits are great ways to support your overall health and wellness, flu season or not," Stinchfield concludes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_69-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These ideas for what to eat and drink before and after a flu shot can help you breeze through the appointment and recovery process. Still, that doesn't mean you're protected by a germ-proof coat of armor.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_70-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_71-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "While getting the flu shot can protect a person during cold and flu season, it isn't a magic bullet for everyone," Manaker says. "Continuing to support your immune health by eating vitamin-rich produce, sleeping well and exercising can help support your immune health and can be important components of your lifestyle choices during cold and flu season." So just listen to your body to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291742/when-youre-craving-a-food-maybe-you-need-to-just-eat-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;feed it what it's craving&lt;/a&gt; and keep these general best practices in mind.

Additionally, pollutants may damage the cornea, leading to scarring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And reducing chemical contaminants by about 20 percent led to improvements in vision scores in children with mild myopia.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers believe reducing pollution levels while children's eyes are vulnerable and developing could improve vision levels before severe, lasting disease begins.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers in China found environmental pollution contributed to myopia, or nearsightedness, in children (stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Zongbo Shi, co-supervisor of the study and professor of atmospheric biogeochemistry at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/birmingham/index.html" id="mol-0eb8a370-9881-11f0-b8ad-d5409f3869ab"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt; in the UK, said: 'While genetics and screen time are long recognized as contributors to childhood myopia, this study is among the first to isolate air pollution as a meaningful and modifiable risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Clean air isn’t just about respiratory health - it’s about visual health too. Our results show that improving air quality could be a valuable strategic intervention to protect children’s eyesight, especially during their most vulnerable developmental years.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published Tuesday in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/4/9/pgaf279/8259670?searchresult=1#533024996"&gt;PNAS Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, looked at 29,971 Chinese children in elementary, middle and high school, who were recruited between March 2021 and December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The majority (70 percent) were in elementary school, and 52 percent of participants were boys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly two-thirds also had at least one parent with myopia, as genetics are a know risk factor, and 85 percent lived in urban areas, which generally have more pollution that rural neighborhoods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also measured levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a group of microscopic particles that are emitted directly into the air from fossils fuels burned from factories and gasoline-powered stoves and cars, as well as burning wood in fireplaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These particles are so small that they are blind to the eye and the nose and lungs can't filter them out, allowing them to travel to the bloodstream and induce widespread inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also looked at nitrogen oxide (NO2), which is formed from fossil fuel combustion and released by vehicles, power plants and industrial processes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Importantly, the researchers looked at China, which has a PM2.5 concentration six times greater than the World Health Organization's safe limit. It's also the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, producing about 27 percent of global emissions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The team measured levels of NO2 and PM2.5, which are emitted through fossil fuels burned from factories and power plants. Pictured above is a cloud of pollution over Denver, Colorado (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above chart shows the improvement of children's uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) scores after researchers reduced pollution levels in a simulation. UCVA accounts of vision sharpness without corrective lenses &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, 53 percent of participants were diagnosed with myopia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found younger age, parents having myopia and levels of NO2 and PM2.5 were the most significant drivers of myopia in children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found environmental pollution was more closely related to myopia, while children with more access to green space had clearer vision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 81 percent of cases of severe myopia were directly tied to non-modifiable risk factors like genetics and younger age, whereas environmental factors only contributed to 4.3 percent of severe cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, environmental factors explained 12 percent of mild myopia cases, and behavioral factors like sleep and the amount of time spent outside in green space accounted for 13.6 percent of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found PM2.5 pollution was linked to 44 percent more myopia cases in milder disease versus more severe forms of myopia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows levels of PM2.5 in each US state as of 2020, the latest data available&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows levels of PM2.5 in each US county as of 2020, the latest data available&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also used machine learning to simulate 'clean air' scenarios and measure the impacts of lower concentrations of air pollution. They found reducing NO2 and PM2.5 levels by 20 percent improved children's overall vision scores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'Thus, roughly one-quarter of the risk in [mild] myopia was attributable to modifiable influences, nearly double the relative contribution seen in high myopia.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'This pattern indicates that in children with school myopia, differences in pollution exposure have a stronger impact on vision, whereas in severe myopia cases, vision impairment is mainly driven by demographic factors, leaving environmental influences less influential.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Study co-author Dr Yuquing Dai of the University of Birmingham said: 'Myopia is on the rise globally, and it can lead to serious eye problems later in life. While we can’t change a child’s genes, we can improve their environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If we act early - before severe myopia sets in - we can make a real difference.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 16:55:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNczVkMnBhSC01OERkaVpVRkExZ1h6MFNobWhWS2FYYXJiM3Nyb2dXdVQwU0Qxcy10cFNDUFlLUzhDc3ZHWUM4dVdUeTN0dnFDS2Q2TVdUUXZ4Zm45SzIzMnIzQ2xNRE1sa2RKS1FkMVZqZTFyZjRCWkhhSUs2R1JQREZOOWh6Q1dRQ2ozYTZuRUFNZDRkMzk1cTU0aHFvZWkt0gGmAUFVX3lxTE1BYmVwZm1yOEpnQlpMN283bUlrRUdTQThoeFhwRk9QTTFudWhYakVGcTdDa0cwM0pJMHpBZENsV2NsMVZmZUppSEI3ZkMtenR6azRtdnZva1FFYlZWUWNVbkRNbDFHeS1mYW03d3JxbFoxeFNXZXFmZFVsSnIyN2huZ2xDbkwxbjQwcXZNQlFfelNFUGwxd29GTXZMaFhmbDc4WWU3V1E</guid></item><item><title>长寿专家揭示了他每天为减缓衰老而做的五件简单的事情-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15123347/longevity-expert-dementia-dugal-bain-kim.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dugal Bain-Kim never took his health too seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after his father was diagnosed with &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-0a0a9c40-97f3-11f0-9811-1d4bdc987ea4"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; and died shortly after at the age of 70, the longevity start-up founder began paying more attention to his health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bain-Kim, 41, said: 'There's this common misperception that Alzheimer's and dementia are like getting struck by lightning, it's just bad luck and there's nothing to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[But] having that information [about your risk] can lead someone to think differently about their life.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The father-of-two said his family history of the disease means he is at &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14306209/supplements-cause-prevent-alzheimers.html"&gt;higher risk&lt;/a&gt;, making it particularly important to him to avoid the same suffering that his father went through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dementia is a crippling disease that gradually robs patients of their ability to &lt;a target="_self" href="/yourmoney/product-recalls/index.html" id="mol-0125f6f0-987b-11f0-891b-c9d2a3dca2d6"&gt;recall&lt;/a&gt; names and places and eventually take care of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An estimated 7.2million Americans suffer from the disease, and some estimates suggest that number could double to 13.8million over the next three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dugal Bain-Kim, 41, said he started to take his health seriously and try to prevent dementia after his father was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and died at age 70 years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Detailing his top five health hacks for helping to slow down aging in his brain and hopefully reduce his risk of dementia, Bain-Kim, who founded the start-up Lifeforce, told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-startup-founder-habits-to-protect-brain-aging-alzheimers-2025-9"&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt; he relies on specific diets and workouts, as well as supplements and sound sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regular exercise boosts blood flow to the brain to help clear out substances that could cause dementia, and quality sleep can also help the brain clear out potentially harmful deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And research has shown that certain diets or lifestyle habits can also boost brain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Below, Daily Mail details the longevity expert's top tips:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;CREATINE SUPPLEMENTS &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Creatine, long popular with bodybuilders, is now attracting fans looking to boost their cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The supplement is made from three amino acids, glycine, arginine and methionine,  and provides extra fuel to boost muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But studies suggest that this extra fuel could also be used by the brain, with the energy potentially helping to fend off cognitive decline and protect against stress caused by sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40395689/"&gt;2025 study&lt;/a&gt; found dementia patients who took 20 grams of creatine a day for eight weeks had a slight increase in cognitive function compared to those who did not take the supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bain-Kim believes that people already take far too many supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But amid its potential brain health effects, he said he added this supplement to his daily routine because he felt it might help to lower his risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Creatine is widely available in powder and pill forms, with users advised to take around three to five grams per day.

This means that a 30-year-old has a maximum heart rate of 190 beats per minute and a Zone 2 heart rate of around 113 to 132 beats per minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;FOLLOW THE 'MIND' DIET&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have touted the Mediterranean diet as a way to boost cognitive health for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Bain-Kim says he recently switched to the Mediterranean-Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet, or the MIND diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MIND is an eating plan developed by Harvard researchers to slow cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some research has suggested it can slow decline, including a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4581900/"&gt;2015 study&lt;/a&gt; on 1,000 adults that showed slower cognitive decline among those on the diet compared to those not on the diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2302368"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; on the diet that tracked 2,000 cognitively unimpaired people for three years found no significant differences in cognitive function or brain size between those on and not on the diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The MIND diet emphasizes fibers and healthy fats such as omega-3s that can support brain health by helping the brain form and maintain cell membranes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The diet consists of at least six servings of leafy greens, at least five servings of nuts, at least four of beans, two or more servings of berries and one serving of fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel or sardines per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those on the diet also use olive oil as their primary cooking oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say this diet may reduce the risk of dementia by cutting inflammation levels and improving the health of blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;MORE QUALITY SLEEP&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sleep is also being touted as a way to prevent dementia, with experts saying it can also remove potentially dangerous toxins from the brain (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sleep has recently become the cornerstone of every 'longevity athlete's' fitness plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Bain-Kim is no exception, saying that for peak health and performance he tries to sleep about seven hours and 45 minutes every night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This tracks with the CDC's recommendation, which states everyone needs between seven and nine hours every night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Everyone appreciates a good night's sleep, but for me that's now core to my strategy because of the brain protection benefits of getting enough sleep,' he told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's become the non-negotiable for me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts suggest sleep can help ward off dementia by allowing the brain to clear harmful proteins, such as beta-amyloid, which build up in the organ during waking hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://theconversation.com/poor-sleep-may-nudge-the-brain-toward-dementia-researchers-find-265216"&gt;study found this month&lt;/a&gt; that people suffering from chronic insomnia, or struggling to sleep, were twice as likely to develop dementia as healthy adults who slept normally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — Infection rates from drug-resistant “nightmare bacteria” rose almost 70% between 2019 and 2023, according to a new &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-02404" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria that are difficult to treat due to the so-called NDM gene primarily drove the increase, CDC researchers wrote in &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://doi.org/10.7326/ANNALS-25-02404" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;an article published Monday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Only two antibiotics work against those infections, and the drugs are expensive and must be administered through an IV, researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria with the gene were once considered exotic, linked to a small number of patients who received medical care overseas. Though the numbers are still small, the rate of U.S. cases jumped more than fivefold in recent years, the researchers reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The rise of NDMs in the U.S. is a grave danger and very worrisome,” said David Weiss, an Emory University infectious diseases researcher, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;It’s likely many people are unrecognized carriers of the drug-resistant bacteria, which could lead to community spread, the CDC scientists said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may play out in doctors’ offices across the country, as infections long considered routine and easy to treat — like urinary tract infections — could become chronic problems, said Dr. Maroya Walters, one of the report’s authors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial resistance occurs when germs such as bacteria and fungi gain the power to fight off the drugs designed to kill them. The misuse of antibiotics was a big reason for the rise — unfinished or unnecessary prescriptions that didn’t kill the germs made them stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the CDC has drawn attention to “ &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/afcee30eb24848d38f9b855fbcc9a4ba"&gt;nightmare bacteria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ” resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. That includes carbapenems, a class of antibiotics considered a last resort for treatment of serious infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers drew data from 29 states that do the necessary testing and reporting of carbapenem-resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;They counted 4,341 cases of carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections from those states in 2023, with 1,831 of them the NDM variety. The researchers did not say how many of the infected people died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate of carbapenem-resistant infections rose from just under 2 per 100,000 people in 2019 to more than 3 per 100,000 in 2023 — an increase of 69%. But the rate of NDM cases rose from around 0.25 to about 1.35 — an increase of 460%, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A researcher not involved in the study said the increase is probably related to the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/covid-19-pandemic"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that there was a huge surge in antibiotic use during the pandemic, so this likely is reflected in increasing drug resistance,” said Dr. Jason Burnham, a Washington University researcher, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s count is only a partial picture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many states are not fully testing and reporting cases. Even in states that do, cases tend to be among hospital patients sick enough to warrant special testing. Many hospitals also aren’t able to do the testing needed to detect certain forms of genetic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC researchers did not have data from some of the most populous states, including California, Florida, New York and Texas, which means the absolute number of U.S. infections “is definitely underestimated,” Burnham said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;This is not the first study to report a rise. A CDC &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7423a2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; published in June noted an increase in NDM cases in New York City between 2019 and 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

They found that millennials — born between 1981 and 1996 — appear to be aging biologically faster than previous generations, based on biomarkers in blood that indicate the health of various organs. That acceleration was associated with a significantly increased risk — up to 42 percent — for certain cancers, especially those of the lung, gastrointestinal tract and uterus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="4NBOJB3KZ5CCPLZUPDG3XKRWNQ" data-contentid="4NBOJB3KZ5CCPLZUPDG3XKRWNQ" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idwISdm-css"&gt;Much of the work in this area is in its early stages and has not proved a direct cause and effect in humans. The evidence comes from epidemiological studies, which look at patterns of disease in large populations; observational studies, which track people’s behaviors and exposures without intervening; and animal models which are sometimes, but not always, good proxies for people.

A panel of experts published a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/series-do/alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.thelancet.com/series-do/alzheimers-disease"&gt;series of articles in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Monday detailing these advances, while also addressing the major controversy surrounding the new treatments — the first to alter the course of the disease, but criticized for being expensive, having side effects, and showing only modest efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Juan Fortea, head of the Neurobiology of Dementia group at the Sant Pau Research Institute and co-author of one of the &lt;i&gt;Lancet&lt;/i&gt; articles, says Alzheimer’s research is at a “paradigm shift.” “We are not curing the disease,” he clarifies, “but it is the first time in human history that we have managed to slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The driving force behind this scientific turning point is a &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2024-01-29/merce-boada-neurologist-the-more-we-learn-about-alzheimers-the-more-able-we-will-be-to-decide-when-we-want-to-stop-living-this-way.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/health/2024-01-29/merce-boada-neurologist-the-more-we-learn-about-alzheimers-the-more-able-we-will-be-to-decide-when-we-want-to-stop-living-this-way.html"&gt;new generation of drugs&lt;/a&gt; that eliminate beta-amyloid protein, which accumulates in diseased brains, and slow disease progression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Albert Lleó, head of Neurology at Sant Pau in Barcelona, emphasizes that this is just “the beginning of the journey”: “There are 138 more drugs under investigation. These are the first of many to come.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Researchers are also exploring, for example, the potential of semaglutide, which has already revolutionized obesity treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The drugs that have raised all hopes are called lecanemab and donanemab. In clinical trials, the first slowed disease progression by 27%, and the second by 35%. Both are approved in the United States and other countries, but the European Medicines Agency (EMA), more conservative, &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2024-09-25/a-scientific-rebellion-to-get-europe-to-approve-a-controversial-alzheimers-drug.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2024-09-25/a-scientific-rebellion-to-get-europe-to-approve-a-controversial-alzheimers-drug.html"&gt;took time to approve lecanemab&lt;/a&gt; (giving approval a year ago after initially rejecting it) and is still reviewing donanemab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Both drugs have been surrounded by controversy, even within the scientific community. First, because of &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2025-08-06/discovery-of-lithiums-essential-role-in-alzheimers-disease-opens-a-hopeful-avenue-for-treatment.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2025-08-06/discovery-of-lithiums-essential-role-in-alzheimers-disease-opens-a-hopeful-avenue-for-treatment.html"&gt;potential side effects&lt;/a&gt; — for example, lecanemab has been linked to cerebral hemorrhages and the deaths of two patients — but also because of doubts about the clinical benefit: what does reducing disease progression by 27% really mean for a family’s day-to-day life? Other concerns include the price (estimated at around $25,000 per patient per year) and the fact that the drugs are only intended for very specific patients in the very early stages of the disease, with specific characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;In the &lt;i&gt;Lancet&lt;/i&gt; series, the authors — some of whom disclosed conflicts of interest due to ties with the pharmaceutical companies producing these drugs — analyze this “range of reactions” and the “skepticism” these drugs generated in the scientific community, asking whether the same would have happened with other diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;They even compare efficacy, cost, and impact of the new Alzheimer’s drugs with those of other biologic drugs for different conditions. For instance, with lecanemab and donanemab, serious adverse effects occurred in 1 in 300 and 1 in 65 patients, respectively; but in trials of pembrolizumab (an immunotherapy) for lung cancer, side effects occurred in 27% of cases. Another comparison: the reduction in disability from anti-amyloid drugs in Alzheimer’s is similar to that observed in trials of biologic drugs for rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Based on the history of other biologic drugs in different diseases, the authors argue that the magnitude of effect may be very similar. In those cases, they note, prices were also high and the drugs were not free of side effects. Regarding the limited access to a very specific group of patients — experts estimate that for now only 5% of people with Alzheimer’s will benefit — the authors point out that in multiple sclerosis, for example, the use of innovative drugs was limited to 36% of patients in 2017 and rose to 74% in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“What these authors are putting forward isn’t a direct comparison with other diseases, but rather a demonstration that there are other therapies in medicine that have a comparable magnitude of effect, but Alzheimer’s has characteristics that undervalue these advances,” says David Pérez, head of Neurology at the 12 de Octubre Hospital in Madrid, who was not involved in this series. He refers to a handful of factors, ranging from scientific skepticism to social prejudices, which have created a climate conducive to controversy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Pérez notes, for example, that the history of Alzheimer’s drug development has been “bumpy,” marked by successive failures that planted a seed of distrust in the scientific community. The controversy over aducanumab, a drug approved in the U.S. under controversial circumstances but which failed commercially and was later withdrawn by the manufacturer, did not help. “It was approved in a twisted way, without clear benefit, and that generated an atmosphere of mistrust,” Pérez explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=""&gt;Nihilism and ageism&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;There is also “a lot of nihilism” surrounding this disease, says Lleó: “Many times, the diagnosis is not made accurately, and since there is no treatment, the public feels no need to demand a diagnosis or timelines the way they do for stroke or cancer. Sometimes, the symptoms are considered part of normal aging. All of this contributes to the perception of a disease in which there is little that can be done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Another factor affecting the debate, according to Pérez, is ageism: “This is a disease that primarily affects older people, who cannot raise their voices and demand anything from society. These patients are a vulnerable group.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The scale of the disease, the experts consulted add, has also fueled doubts at the policy and regulatory level. “If it weren’t such a prevalent disease, if it didn’t cause a strain on the healthcare system, on costs, and on procedural changes, some of the controversy wouldn’t have arisen. If it were a rare disease, we have little doubt that this would have been approved without any controversy and very quickly,” Fortea says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;This first generation of drugs presents a &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2025-06-25/searching-for-an-alzheimers-cure-in-a-chickens-eye.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2025-06-25/searching-for-an-alzheimers-cure-in-a-chickens-eye.html"&gt;challenge for healthcare systems&lt;/a&gt;. Both in identifying patients who can benefit — which requires diagnostic and biomarker tests to confirm the disease, as well as genetic studies to rule out incompatible mutations — and in the treatment and follow-up itself: the therapy is intravenous, administered in a day hospital, and requires regular MRIs to monitor for potential hemorrhages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“Seeing patients in outpatient consultations, once every six months or once a year, is one thing; lecanemab treatment is another. It involves infusions every two weeks in a day hospital, plus four MRIs per year and numerous visits… A patient goes from one or two relatively short visits per year to 24, 30, or 35 visits. Imagine the workload this represents. It will be challenging for the system to adapt, but since it will [initially] involve only a minority of patients, the system can gradually adjust,” Fortea says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The experts consulted emphasize that potential side effects are manageable. Regarding clinical benefit, Fortea notes that “that 30% translates into the patient gaining six months over 18 months.” In other words: “To progress to the next phase, you progress 30% more slowly. You maintain more autonomy and quality of life because we are slowing a disease that causes significant disability. We are not curing the disease. Patients get worse, but at a slower pace,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;In an interview with EL PAÍS, Cristina Maragall, president of the Pasqual Maragall Foundation, argued that for both the scientific community and families, “it is essential that these medications begin to be used.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=""&gt;Diagnostic revolution&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Therapeutic advances, however, are only one part of this scientific transformation shaking up Alzheimer’s research. The other pillar — diagnostics — is also advancing by leaps and bounds, particularly with the development of biomarkers that identify biological traces of the disease ever earlier. The authors estimate that the arrival of plasma biomarkers, which detect traces of the disease in the blood — with a &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2025-04-09/new-method-detects-alzheimers-in-people-with-symptoms-using-a-blood-test.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/health/2025-04-09/new-method-detects-alzheimers-in-people-with-symptoms-using-a-blood-test.html"&gt;simple blood draw, like a routine test&lt;/a&gt;, biochemical signals of the disease can be identified — “will lead to a new diagnostic revolution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;These tools are “crucial” for confirming the diagnosis at all stages of the disease, says Fortea. He explains that when clinical evaluation and neuropsychological testing confirm mild cognitive impairment, in 60% of cases it will be Alzheimer’s, but in the remaining 40% it will not; and depending on the situation, the patient’s progression and prognosis will be very different. “Therefore, I absolutely need a biomarker to identify who has Alzheimer’s. Otherwise, I won’t know what’s happening,” he says. According to Fortea, in asymptomatic contexts, the only way to select individuals who have Alzheimer’s will also be the biomarker. “The day there are preventive treatments, that biomarker will be our only tool to identify these people,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Fortea is very optimistic about the med-term advances: “We can now diagnose the presence of proteins [related to Alzheimer’s] in the brain of cognitively healthy people. We still can’t predict with certainty whether or when all of these people who have these proteins in their brains will develop the disease, and that’s why population screening isn’t recommended, but this isn’t science fiction. These are clinical trials that are underway and will be published in 2027. In two years, we’ll know if removing amyloid in people without symptoms slows the onset of the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;If this is the case, he says, “conducting &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2024-07-09/can-science-predict-dementia-years-in-advance-the-battle-to-get-ahead-of-neurodegenerative-diseases.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2024-07-09/can-science-predict-dementia-years-in-advance-the-battle-to-get-ahead-of-neurodegenerative-diseases.html"&gt;population screenings&lt;/a&gt; and trying to prevent it would be justified.” “We’re not there yet, but we have diagnostic tools that work and clinical trials are underway. This doesn’t end with these two approved drugs; there are many more to come, not only in these stages of the disease but in others as well. The disease in five years may be unrecognizable from the perspective of how we treat it, prevent it, and what we do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Experts also predict more advances in the field of prevention. In fact, a scientific review identified 14 risk factors — including smoking, hypertension, sedentary lifestyle, and pollution — to avoid in order to prevent nearly half of all dementia cases. “There is potential in prevention,” argues Eider Arenaza-Urquijo, ISGlobal researcher and author of one of the articles in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet &lt;/i&gt;series: “We have already seen a study that has shown that a lifestyle intervention — physical exercise, nutrition, cognitive and social activity — has an impact on cognitive decline in people at higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sign up for &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en"&gt;&lt;i&gt;our weekly newsletter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EL PAÍS English</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 15:18:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_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</guid></item><item><title>酷炫的化学技巧可以将醋变成对抗超级细菌的强大武器- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/cool-chemistry-trick-could-transform-vinegar-into-a-powerful-weapon-against-superbugs-2000662684</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none "&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;Whenever “quantum” enters the scene, science can take many unexpected turns. Common cooking ingredients are no exception to this rule—as demonstrated by European researchers investigating the healing power of vinegar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.5c03108"&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/a&gt; paper suggests that antimicrobial nanoparticles significantly boost the bacteria-killing abilities of vinegar, formally known as acetic acid. Specifically, the researchers engineered &lt;a href="https://edwardflagg.faculty.wvu.edu/research/quantum-dots"&gt;quantum dots&lt;/a&gt;—tiny particles controlled by quantum mechanical effects—to target and annihilate bacterial species. These germ-killing nanoparticles flourished in a weak vinegar solution, according to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Quantum germ killers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bacterial infections obstruct the body’s natural healing mechanisms, especially for vulnerable populations, such as the elderly or people with other underlying conditions. Meanwhile, vinegar has long been used as a non-toxic remedy for disinfecting household surfaces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new mixture takes advantage of this feature to create a safe, effective healing mixture, the researchers said. Often, bacterial infections create an alkaline environment around the wounded area, which slows down the healing process. The vinegar counters this tendency by forcing the bacteria into a more acidic environment, according to the paper. This causes the harmful bacteria to swell up, which subsequently makes it easier for the quantum dots to infiltrate and invade the internal structure of the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Once exposed, the nanoparticles appear to attack dangerous bacteria from both inside the bacterial cell and also on its surface, causing them to burst,” explained Adam Truskewycz, study lead author and a molecular biologist at QIMR Berghofer in Australia, in a &lt;a href="https://www.qimrb.edu.au/whats-on/news/nanoparticles-supercharge-vinegar's-old-fashioned-wound-healing-power"&gt;release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Importantly, this approach is non-toxic to human cells and was shown to remove bacterial infections from mice wounds without affecting healing,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The power of combination treatments&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;That said, we don’t typically pour vinegar on ourselves to treat stubborn cuts. The researchers are aware of this, too, and suggest that the point of this miraculous vinegar mixture is to use it in tandem with “systemic antibiotics” and “topical antiseptics,” according to the paper. The study also conducted its experiments in mice, so whether the mixture will show similar results for human skin has yet to be proven.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regardless, the results reflect a bold approach to incorporate quantum dots—a theoretically interesting concept generally limited to semiconductor use—into something that’s very practical, like an advanced disinfectant. It’s also worth noting that, for all our medical advances, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance"&gt;millions worldwide&lt;/a&gt; die from antimicrobial resistance, or when existing antiseptics can’t completely kill harmful bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Combination treatments such as the ones highlighted in this study may help to curb antimicrobial resistance,” Truskewycz said. “Given this issue can kill up to 5 million people each year, it’s vital we look to find new ways of killing pathogens like viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocado toast with fried cheese as the bread and zucchini noodles in butter-bacon sauce are among the many recipe ideas fueling social media's beloved high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic, or keto diet. However, scientists have found that while keto can lead to limited weight gain and even weight loss, it does so at the cost of metabolic issues like glucose intolerance.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;
     
     
     &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7587637799"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
     
&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In a joint study by the University of Utah and Utah Diabetes and Metabolism Research Center, U.S., scientists divided &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mice/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt; into four dietary groups: &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/ketogenic+diet/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;ketogenic diet&lt;/a&gt; (KD, 90% fat), a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/high-fat+diet/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;high-fat diet&lt;/a&gt; (HFD, 60% fat), low-fat (LFD), and low-fat moderate protein (LFMP), with varying levels of carbohydrates and proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mice were allowed to eat freely for up to 36 weeks in males and 44 weeks in females. Test results showed that while the KD supported weight control, it also raised blood cholesterol levels and led to fatty liver in males.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings are &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adx2752" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diet is named "ketogenic" because it sends the body into ketosis—a metabolic state where the body burns fat as the primary fuel instead of the usual carbohydrates, and, as a result, produces molecules called ketone bodies. The diet isn't a new food trend, it has been around for nearly 100 years and is well-established for treating drug-resistant epilepsy in children, by reducing seizures in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact way a KD helps control seizures is still unclear, but several ideas have been proposed. Some studies have suggested that KD can stabilize &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+glucose/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood glucose&lt;/a&gt; (BG), which is beneficial to brain metabolism and neurotransmitter activity, while others highlight the anticonvulsant effects of ketone bodies themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As ketogenic diets have exploded in popularity in recent years, the researchers of this study wanted to explore the long-term metabolic effects of following the diet. Previous studies have explored this arena, but often reported mixed findings or did not directly compare KDs to other diets or account for both sexes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They found that KD protected against excessive weight gain compared to the conventional high-fat diet, but gained more weight than low-fat diets. Long-term KD caused severe hyperlipidemia, meaning there were very high levels of fat in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KD-fed mice developed severe glucose intolerance because the diet caused a severe impairment in insulin secretion from the pancreas. While female mice on KD seemed fine, the male ones showed signs of liver dysfunction and fatty liver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings made it quite evident that long-term KD can trigger several metabolic disturbances, raising caution against its widespread use as a health-promoting diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that further studies are needed to explore how variations in fat composition and macronutrient ratios affect metabolic effects. This is especially important for making the ketogenic diet safer for people who rely on it to treat epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;

It is advised to consider September through October as the prime time for flu vaccinations. Receiving the vaccine in July and August is not recommended, except in specific cases where the person will not be able to get the shot in September or October, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2022-2023/flu-vaccination-recommendations-adopted.htm" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who should get the flu vaccine?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PQU3K62W3JFVHNLCJPH5PZRL6A"&gt;The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/rr/rr7305a1.htm" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; that everyone 6 months or older receive a flu vaccine. The effectiveness of the vaccine varies depending on how closely the virus strains in the vaccine match those currently circulating. However, the CDC says vaccination is the most important protection from contracting influenza and potential complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What flu vaccine options are available? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="V5W5SCASSRHNRO4FHW5CWWBTDM"&gt;There are a few choices when it comes to available flu vaccines offered at pharmacies, doctor’s offices and health clinics. Trivalent influenza vaccines, which protect against three different strains of the virus, are recommended for all age groups. However, those over 65 are at a higher risk of complications from the flu so the CDC recommends an enhanced vaccine to provide better protection. The Food and Drug Administration approved a nasal spray vaccination option last year called FluMist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CMLHKZ74YJF7NGSFKNGIWPKD54"&gt;For those with egg allergies, the vaccine is available in egg-free formulations.

Well, a recent report from the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention is sounding the alarm about the rising prevalence of the biting insects in the United States and the potentially deadly disease they spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say Chagas disease should be declared endemic in the U.S. because it is now a constant occurrence. The disease is caused by a parasite spread in the droppings of infected triatomine insects, commonly known as kissing bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease is not spread person to person, but it can spread through contaminated blood, organs, food and pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kissing bugs got their name because they usually bite people in the face and around the mouth area at night while they’re asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(MORE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://weather.com/health/allergy/video/why-ragweed-allergy-symptoms-may-be-worse-in-fall" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Why This Allergy Is So Bad Now;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Allergy Is So Bad Now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bugs were once mostly found in the tropics, but with climate change causing warmer temperatures around the globe, the blood-sucking insects are now more prevalent in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CDC report&lt;/a&gt; says kissing bugs have been found in 32 states, mostly in the South. Chagas disease has been found in pets like cats and dogs, as well zoo and wild animals in 17 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human cases have been confirmed in eight states: Texas, California, Arizona, Tennessee, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi and Arkansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, experts point out that because the disease is not well known and doctors aren’t looking for it, cases are likely significantly higher. The nature of the disease also contributes to the unknown number of infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immediate symptoms of Chagas disease can include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the infection can linger for years, and many people will not show any of those symptoms. About 20% to 30% of those who get the disease will develop much more serious problems like an enlarged heart, colon or esophagus, heart failure and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(MORE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://weather.com/news/climate/video/tropical-trees-help-cool-the-planet-climate-change" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:How Planting Trees In The Tropics Could Help Cool The Planet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Planting Trees In The Tropics Could Help Cool The Planet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it’s caught early, Chagas disease can be treated with two types of antiparastic medication.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Korean researchers have uncovered compelling evidence that oral bacteria, once colonized in the gut, can affect neurons in the brain and potentially trigger Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The joint research team, led by Professor Ara Koh and doctoral candidate Hyunji Park of POSTECH's Department of Life Sciences, together with Professor Yunjong Lee and doctoral candidate Jiwon Cheon of Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, collaborated with Professor Han-Joon Kim of Seoul National University College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have identified the mechanism by which metabolites produced by &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/oral+bacteria/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;oral bacteria&lt;/a&gt; in the gut may trigger the development of Parkinson's disease. The findings were &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63473-4" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; online in &lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease is a major neurological disorder characterized by tremors, stiffness, and slowed movement. It affects approximately 1–2% of the global population over the age of 65, making it one of the most common age-related brain diseases. Although previous studies suggested that the gut microbiota of individuals with Parkinson's differs from that of healthy individuals, the specific microbes and metabolites have remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found an increased abundance of Streptococcus mutans—a well-known oral bacterium that causes &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dental+caries/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dental caries&lt;/a&gt;—in the gut microbiome of Parkinson's patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, S. mutans produces the enzyme urocanate reductase (UrdA) and its metabolite imidazole propionate (ImP), both of which were present at elevated levels in the gut and blood of patients. ImP appeared capable of entering systemic circulation, reaching the brain, and contributing to the loss of dopaminergic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Using mouse models, the researchers introduced S. mutans into the gut or engineered E. coli to express UrdA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, the mice showed elevated ImP levels in blood and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+tissue/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain tissue&lt;/a&gt;, along with the hallmark features of Parkinson's symptoms: loss of dopaminergic neurons, heightened neuroinflammation, impaired &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/motor+function/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;motor function&lt;/a&gt;, and increased aggregation of alpha-synuclein, a protein central to disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further experiments demonstrated that these effects depend on the activation of the signaling protein complex mTORC1. Treating mice with an mTORC1 inhibitor significantly reduced neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and alpha-synuclein aggregation, and motor dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that targeting the oral–gut microbiome and its metabolites may offer new therapeutic strategies for Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of how oral microbes in the gut can influence the brain and contribute to the development of Parkinson's disease," said Professor Ara Koh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It highlights the potential of targeting the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gut+microbiota/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt; as a therapeutic strategy, offering a new direction for Parkinson's treatment."&lt;/p&gt;

Courtesy of Tim and Kelsey Drury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But over time, Jack stopped hitting milestones — and the joy of early triumph gave way to fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Then came the devastating news: The Drurys’ only child had a rare, terminal disease so aggressive, most kids don’t live to see their 10th birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I was having dreams of planning his funeral,” said Kelsey, 34, recalling the dark days after Jack’s diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, against all odds, there’s a flicker of hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In New Jersey, a grassroots group is racing to launch the first clinical trial for a gene therapy that could give Jack — and others like him — a fighting chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Early signs, growing concerns&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Drurys first noticed something was off around 8 months, when Jack still hadn’t rolled over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“He just kind of laid there and played, batting at objects that were above him,” Kelsey said. “Cognitively, he was there, he would laugh and look at you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At first, it was easy to dismiss — Jack was born two months early, and preemies often &lt;a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/preemie/Pages/Preemie-Milestones.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:take longer to meet developmental milestones;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;take longer to meet developmental milestones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack developed normally until a few months before turning 1. Courtesy of Tim and Kelsey Drury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“He was right on target as far as fine motor skills and babbling,” Kelsey said. “But that was around the same time we started to notice that he was progressively getting more and more delayed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Drurys enrolled Jack in feeding, physical and occupational therapy at 10 months, but no one could explain why he was falling behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We would do hours of PT, then go home and work on exercises. There was no progress at all,” Kelsey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Eventually, he just never crawled,” she added. Instead, he mastered “butt scooting” to get around their South Amboy home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At 18 months, things took a turn. Suddenly, Jack couldn’t put weight on his legs, let alone walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, children with Jack’s disease lose their motor skills. Courtesy of Tim and Kelsey Drury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I used to call him spaghetti man because when we’d try to get him to stand, his legs just collapsed,” Kelsey said. “That’s when we grew concerned.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Hope and despair&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The family was referred to a neurologist for genetic testing — but the lab lost Jack’s samples. For six long months, the Drurys were left in limbo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Some days filled with hope, others with really dark thoughts,” said Tim Drury, Jack’s father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On July 1, a month after Jack turned 2, they got the diagnosis: &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/infantile-neuroaxonal-dystrophy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy&lt;/a&gt; (INAD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;INAD is a rare genetic disorder that causes fat-like substances to accumulate on the nerves, disrupting signals and slowly stripping children of muscle control, vision, speech and cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For a child to have INAD, both parents must pass on a copy of the faulty PLA2G6 gene. Carrier screening is available, but the process can be complex because INAD is so infrequent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is no known cure or treatment to slow the disease. Fewer than 250 kids worldwide have been diagnosed, according to the &lt;a href="https://rarediseases.org/organizations/inadcure-foundation/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Organization for Rare Disorders;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;National Organization for Rare Disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are just a handful of children in the US living with INAD. Courtesy of Tim and Kelsey Drury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The diagnosis was crushing — a disease so rare, even their own doctors were stumped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Not only did we not know about it, but the neurologist who shared the genetic results with us admitted she hadn’t heard of it before,” Tim, 37, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Their pediatrician and therapists were just as clueless. But one doctor had heard about the &lt;a href="https://inadcure.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:INADcure Foundation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;INADcure Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and pointed the Drurys in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It turns out, out of all the places in the world, the only foundation looking toward a potential treatment — and aiming for a cure — is based right here in New Jersey,” Tim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For years, the nonprofit has worked with scientists to develop a gene therapy designed to deliver a healthy copy of the PLA2G6 gene — the one affected by INAD — to the cells that need it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The goal is to address the root cause of INAD, with the hope of slowing or stabilizing disease progression,” &lt;a href="https://inadcure.org/mission/ourteam/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Leena Panwala;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Leena Panwala&lt;/a&gt;, the foundation’s founder and president, told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gene therapy treatments for INAD are showing promise. Courtesy of Tim and Kelsey Drury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;By the time the Drurys connected with the organization, preclinical trials in mice had shown promising results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Those that received the treatment did well, had longer lifespans and showed more motor function compared to the mice that didn’t,” said &lt;a href="https://www.atlantichealth.org/find-a-doctor/darius-adams-1972506749" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Darius Adams;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Darius Adams&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical and biochemical geneticist on the foundation’s Scientific Medical Advisory Board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The nonprofit signed a deal with a drug manufacturer to produce the treatment, with Adams expressing “cautious optimism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Facing the unknown&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One major hurdle remained: The foundation needed $450,000 to pay the manufacturer before the gene therapy could be released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Drurys funneled their emotions into action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Drurys live in South Amboy, NJ.

Kelsey expected them to receive a trickle of donations — not a tidal wave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It took us six days to close the gap on the $450,000,” Tim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What started as gifts from family and friends quickly snowballed into support from the community and even celebrities like “Real Housewives of New Jersey” star Danielle Cabral and Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi of “Jersey Shore” fame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The INADcure Foundation is waiting on FDA approval to launch the clinical trial, with enrollment set to begin as soon as it gets the green light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“They have a goal to start this early next year,” Tim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But with just 10 spots available, his son’s place isn’t guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Jack is one of the younger participants globally that they’re aware of, so I think there’s certainly potential that he’ll be part of this study,” Tim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The treatment will cost about $200,000 per child.

(KKTV) - A mass die-off of prairie dogs in a Colorado county has health officials concerned that it could be the plague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;La Plata County Public Health Department (LPCPH) announced Monday that it was investigating several once-active prairie dog colonies where there was now little to no activity detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;While for many, the word “plague” conjures up images of plague doctors and the “Bring Out Your Dead” scene from “Monty Python and the Holy Grail,” the scourge of 14th century Europe remains alive and thriving in 21st century America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;But unlike the time of the Black Death, in modern times the plague is highly manageable if caught and treated early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The plague bacterium -- commonly bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic -- can be transmitted by fleas and wild rodents, so animal die-offs like what is suspected in La Plata County with the prairie dogs can be a huge red flag that the plague is present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Plague is frequently detected in rock squirrels, prairie dogs, wood rats, and other species of ground squirrels and chipmunks,” LPCPH said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“It’s often caused due to fleas and so fleas can be carried on animals such as rodents, prairie dogs, our pets like dogs and cats, and then when [animals] come around humans, when we interact with them, [fleas] will jump off and they will bite the individual and then that’s how the individual will get plague,” a health official explained to 11 News last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;LPCPH said it first became aware of the prairie dog die-off in August. To date, no confirmed testing has been done, but the department’s observations at the colonies over the last several weeks led it to release its concerns to the public Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Public health staff conducted an onsite investigation leading to suspicion of plague presence in the area,” it said in a news release. “... There may be additional plague exposures in public areas and on private land that we are not yet aware of.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The health department is advising the public not to take matters into its own hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Residents should not eradicate or kill prairie dogs on their property as this increases the risk of exposure to plague-infested fleas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Instead, it advises people to adhere to the following guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;- Wear repellant and appropriate clothing when outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;- Keep pets away from wildlife and protected from fleas with veterinarian-approved topical medications, flea collars, or other methods of prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;- Avoid sleeping alongside your pets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;- Do not feed or handle wild animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;- Do not handle dead animals or animal waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;- Treat known rodent sites around your home with flea powder or a suitable insecticide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Symptoms of plague include sudden fever and chills, severe headaches, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, and feeling ill. Plague can be treated successfully with antibiotics, but an infected person must be treated quickly to avoid serious complications or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Since pets can contract the plague and pass it on to their humans, the health department says to alert your veterinarian immediately if your pet becomes ill with a high fever and/or an abscess or swollen lymph nodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Most human cases of the plague in the United States occur in western states: California, southern Oregon, western Neasa, northern New Mexico, northern Arizona and southern Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | text-start article-text"&gt;No human cases of the plague have been reported in Colorado this year. There was a &lt;a href="https://www.kktv.com/2024/07/11/bubonic-plague-confirmed-pueblo-what-you-need-know/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.kktv.com/2024/07/11/bubonic-plague-confirmed-pueblo-what-you-need-know/"&gt;confirmed case in Pueblo County last year&lt;/a&gt;; before that, a 10-year-old girl in La Plata County sadly became one of the rare modern-day fatalities when she died of the plague in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="copyright |"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Copyright 2025 KKTV.
