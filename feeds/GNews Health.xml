                                    &lt;div class="hsa-paywall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawaii Department of Health has confirmed a case of rat lungworm disease in an individual on the island of Kauai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rat lungworm disease, a parasitic disease also known as neuroangiostrongyliasis, is known to be endemic on all islands in Hawaii. The diagnosed individual had no history of travel to other islands, outside the state or country, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The individual sought medical care after experiencing symptoms such as headaches, nausea, vomiting, neck stiffness and aversion to bright light. The Hawaii State Laboratories Division confirmed the diagnosis of rat lungworm, using newly available sensitive testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials, however, have not been able to identify the exact source of infection for this individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/disease_listing/rat-lungworm-neuroangiostrongyliasis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Rat lungworm disease&lt;/a&gt;, caused by a roundworm parasite called Angiostrongylus cantonensis, affects the brain and spinal cord and can result in long-term disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parasite is only found in rodents, but infected rodents can pass larvae of the worm in their feces, which can then be ingested by snails, slugs, and some other animals such as freshwater shrimp or prawns, which then become intermediate hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Hawaii, DOH said, most people become ill by accidentally ingesting a snail or slug infected with the parasite, but can also become infected via an intermediate host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH said that from Jan. 1, 2014, to the present, there have been 102 cases of rat lungworm disease reported statewide — 78 from Hawaii County, 13 from Maui County, seven from Honolulu County and four from Kauai County, including this latest case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of cases, 84%, have been in Hawaii County, while the other 16% have been cases reported in visitors. The last case confirmed on Kauai was in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH said early diagnosis is important in order to target treatment, and to reduce the long-term effects associated with this disease. Prevention is also important statewide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thoroughly inspecting and washing all fresh fruits and vegetables under clean, running water is the most effective way to reduce the risk of rat lungworm disease,” said Dr. Sarah Kemble, state epidemiologist, in a news release. “Small slugs and snails on produce can be difficult to see. Cooking food thoroughly also kills the parasite that causes rat lungworm disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH provides the following recommendations to prevent rat lungworm disease:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Wash all fruits and vegetables under clean, running water to remove any tiny slugs or snails. Pay close attention to leafy greens. This is important whether produce comes from a local retailer, farmers market or backyard garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Control snail, slug and rat populations around homes, gardens and farms. Get rid of snails, slugs and rats safely by clearing debris where they might live. Consider using traps and baits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Maintain water catchment systems and replace filters regularly. Cover and protect catchment tanks, as slugs can crawl up the tank and get into the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;                                
                                
                                
                                                                
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="23" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6t002d3b79sgqrerqk@published"&gt;I’m a 46-year-old, bisexual woman who is 10 years older than my partner. I have a ton more experience and kinks than him.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqs4qxu00313b790k8riv2r@published"&gt;I’ve had to let the kinks go because it’s not in his nature. He’s also small compared to previous partners. He doesn’t have a micro penis, but it’s below average. You could say I was a size queen, as I used to only look for partners on the large end of the spectrum before I met him. I was also non-monogamous for five years before him. I had girlfriends, boyfriends, threesomes, and moresomes. It’s been eight years, and there’s no kink, no women, only one threesome, and a small penis.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="130" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6u002e3b79bcif00ay@published"&gt;I’m sad about all of this all the time. The sex is OK, and he puts in so much effort, but I miss the feeling of a larger penis. I love to give oral (so does he), but it’s a bummer that I can’t even use my hands and mouth at the same time. I can’t give him the full experience. I don’t try to have threesomes because I’m embarrassed by his size, and he would not be OK if I dated other men. I plan to be with him for the rest of my life; he is the best person I’ve ever met. However, right now, it’s me and my magic wand against the world. I don’t want him to feel like I have to use it every time.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6v002f3b797bzw61pg@published"&gt;Is there hope for me? How can I stop thinking about other, bigger penises all the time? I’m somewhat OK without BDSM, but I need something. I also find myself craving a relationship with a woman. We don’t have sex very often, which might contribute to the whole situation. Lastly, I’m conventionally attractive and get flirted with all the time. That does not help. I wish I weren’t experienced and “freaky.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="44" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6v002i3b799t6skhc8@published"&gt;There’s plenty of hope in several different directions. Our ability to control our thoughts is pretty limited, and mostly relies on mindfulness or actively thinking about something we want to think about instead of trying to push away the thoughts we hope to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6v002j3b79u2mvxcax@published"&gt;With direct answers to your questions out of the way, I have to point out: You sound pretty miserable. If you simply needed a place to vent, I’m happy we could provide that, and encourage you to consider who you might be able to trust to be that place for you in the future. You’ll want a friend who doesn’t know your partner, or at least isn’t socializing with them extensively, and who is able and willing to hold these frustrations without sharing them around town.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6w002k3b793rmp8gf1@published"&gt;Are you attracted to your partner? Your letter contained an extensive list of ways his physical attributes turn you off, and then a statement about him being the best person you’ve ever met, so I’m left wondering whether there’s anything about him that does turn you on but that you didn’t include.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="142" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6w002l3b79frhkurs0@published"&gt;If you aren’t attracted to him at all, in the sexual sense, could that be contributing to the infrequency of the sex you have together? I’m also wondering whether your description of kink as “not in his nature” means that you’ve made an assumption, and whether there might be more wiggle room there than you think. Have you given him the chance to decide for himself whether he’s up for any of the aspects of BDSM that you’re missing? Reading between the lines a little, men who are respectful, solicitous, and follow their female partners’ leads outside the bedroom often make great male doms with a bit of encouragement and support. What we might see as a man’s “nature” lending itself to sexual dominance can sometimes be an alpha identity or a more explicit tendency to be abusive. Give that some thought.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="127" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqrgs6x002m3b79j0ktdndg@published"&gt;Meanwhile, how much of your decision to stay with this partner is based on ideas about monogamy and vanilla sex being more “normal” or “better,” or in fear that you’ll never find a human as great as this one again, and, therefore, should rearrange yourself to keep him? If any of that resonates, spend some time with the friend I suggested you talk with up top, or with a sex-positive therapist, working toward a clearer understanding of what you actually need and want. It absolutely might be the case that you stick with your choice to forgo the extremely novel and varied sex life you used to have. Regardless, I think you’ll have an easier time living with your decision if you’re thorough about arriving at one.&lt;/p&gt;

However, I have one problem with him: His dick is GIGANTIC. It’s both a length problem and a girth issue—it’s nearly as thick around as a soda can. Penis-in-vagina sex is possible for us, but it takes a ton of foreplay and lube to make it happen. Much of the time, I don’t orgasm outside of non-penetrative sex because it feels like I’m being stretched to the breaking point. Is there some way I can loosen myself up so we can make this work physically?&lt;/p&gt;

First, foreplay is fantastic regardless. Ideally, this foreplay includes at least one adequate-to-great orgasm for you, as that tends to help with relaxing the vaginal canal. You also might try very slow penetration at first, or even entering without thrusting at all, to give your body time to adjust.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqs6514003l3b79irakxu97@published"&gt;Speaking of time, you’ve only been having sex with this man for a few weeks, so your body might do some adjusting of its own over the next few months. And you can work on letting the muscles in your pelvic floor relax. Try breathing techniques that encourage physical relaxation, and visualizing your body opening, until you find something that works for you or get fed up with the process. But do give each practice more than a single cursory attempt. Most likely, you’ll need a combination of these tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

Not only am I regularly left drained from dealing with two very young children, but the idea of a sex party taking place in an area where my kids play doesn’t sit well with me, no matter how good a job I might do of cleaning it. I haven’t given my husband a definitive answer on whether we will resume, but I know he’s going to be crushed when I tell him this is a chapter in our lives that I want to remain closed. Any advice on how to break it to him?&lt;/p&gt;

Your kids are going to get older and require less minute-by-minute care. They’ll start going to school for large portions of every weekday and participating in activities that don’t require your supervision in their free time. In a decade and a half, they’ll probably be out of the home entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgqs6gc300413b79qdjoniu6@published"&gt;You could attend orgies organized by other people, or at locations outside your home. If you go to your husband with explanations for your decision that are fairly easy to work around, he’s almost certainly going to have hope that you’ll change your mind when the kids are older or if he finds a way to throw the party elsewhere. If you’re done with orgies for other reasons, get clear on that before you broach the subject with your husband and be prepared to share &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; reasons—even if it’s simply that you’re done and aren’t sure why.&lt;/p&gt;

Something like, “I know you really want this, and I need to tell you that I don’t want it anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;

In a sudden stop, the body continues moving forward with the car's momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If feet are on the dashboard, this can force the legs into a position that causes severe &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-7924629/Womans-hips-crushed-crash-propped-feet-dashboard.html"&gt;injuries like hip breaks&lt;/a&gt;, bone fractures and joint dislocations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, airbags deploy with tremendous force during a collision. If a passenger's feet are on the dashboard, the airbag can impact the legs with enough power to cause fractures, dislocations, and other severe injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The seat belt is the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14430187/Doctors-dangers-not-wearing-seatbelt.html"&gt;primary defense in a crash&lt;/a&gt;, but this safety measure is compromised when feet are on the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In this position, the seat belt cannot properly restrain the passenger, increasing the risk of being thrown forward. This can lead to severe head injuries, broken bones or even ejection from the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Feet on the dashboard also impedes a passenger's reaction time, preventing them from bracing quickly for sudden stops or obstacles and endangering all occupants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Feet on the dashboard prevents the seatbelt from properly restraining a passenger, dramatically increasing the risk of severe injury or ejection in a crash&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Solomon Behar, a pediatric emergency medicine physician at Miller Children’s &amp;amp; Women’s Hospital in Long Beach, California, told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.aol.com/articles/er-docs-want-people-stop-145000250.html"&gt;Parade &lt;/a&gt;magazine: ‘I do a lot of driving on Los Angeles freeways, and one of the things that makes me cringe is when I pass a passenger who has their feet up on the dashboard.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Placing feet on the dashboard fundamentally alters the passenger's posture and, consequently, the function of the seatbelt, creating a cascade of failure points in the event of a collision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Behar added: ‘[Sitting upright with feed on the floor is safest because] it allows the seat belt and airbag systems to function as they were supposed to, distributing the forces more evenly and actually reducing the risk of drying your legs and pelvis.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During a frontal collision, the body will pivot at the waist and slide underneath the lap belt, which allows the lower body to thrust forward while the upper body is unrestrained, dramatically increasing the risk of severe internal abdominal injuries and spinal damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the car stops or slams into another vehicle in front, the head, torso and lower body are all thrown forward with the car’s momentum, but the locked seatbelt restrains the torso. Meanwhile, the lower body continues to move forward violently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The knees, already pressed against the dashboard, become a pivot point while the dashboard stops the lower legs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The thigh bones are the long, strong levers that concentrate immense force on the hips and knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can lead to a fracture of the socket of the hip joint in the pelvis, which endangers the entire structure of the hip and often requires extensive reconstructive surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Based on 2019-2020 data, the most recent data published by the CDC, the rate of emergency department visits for car crashes varied significantly by age, averaging 11.6 visits per 1,000 people annually. The rate peaked at 19.1 for young adults aged 15-24&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The long thigh bone can snap near the hip or just above the knee from the bending stress and the kneecap can be shattered as it is crushed between the femur and the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jacob Snow, a pediatric emergency room specialist at Pediatrix Medical Group in Las Vegas, Nevada, said: ‘Cars are designed to protect passengers seated with their feet on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It prevents the risk of your legs buckling or being pushed back into your face by the dash itself or the airbags. Additionally, many cars have special airbags designed to protect your legs.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An airbag deploys at speeds between 100 and 220 MPH. If a passenger's feet are on the dashboard at the moment of deployment, the explosive force can drive their knees backward with enough violence to cause severe facial and head trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Snow added: ‘There is always some risk of being involved in a car accident every time you ride or drive. Riding with your feet on the dash adds unnecessary risk.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 16:18:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOcVFnMWJHUHpSS24xY0tJdVFLX3dWbGdSYV9Sc0dWczFMMnhMTWhQbnY2X1lYYmp2a2pFdUZoQWJUNEZobUxBMzJSMUlKanNtcXo3X09Fd0pIWVZNRkFnOUwxV2k0Sm1BQmxTT2ZPbXViUWU1Q2NsSW01a004bzhIWmNyc1dJbllwYlBYUDY5bmJtbTRCb3Y0anZGSkVnaHEyaWUxc2xPYVJfd9IBrwFBVV95cUxQa2tfb3ljcjE5NG5nR0pWRE91eC1lODJuMER1c2xUOGdYd2xmV3BBMWNJc01aeGhab3RaUTJvbWcyOWdta1ROUmF1WURCMjhlSFhzNXB5RnZXRjB4ZGtJRllNRFlLekZtRzNRNDgweDJsLTMzMzRlQ2N3eXB5MFFVS2ZlMGNTM3dOTUs2cHVIb1JWZEV1WmVKaWNtUjM5M2xDU09OMmZFTFBkVzlqMFlF</guid></item><item><title>X射线预测人工智能可以改变护理，萨里研究发现-英国广播公司</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy599d184eo</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;An Artificial Intelligence (AI) system that can predict what a knee X-ray will look like in the future could transform how millions of patients with osteoarthritis are treated, researchers have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Researchers at the University of Surrey said the developed technology used machine learning to visualise what the knee will look like in a year's time and score its disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease affecting more than 500 million people worldwide, according to the university.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Prof Gustavo Carneiro said it would help clinicians identify high-risk patients sooner and personalise their care "in ways that were not previously practical".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The AI system was trained on nearly 50,000 X-rays from almost 5,000 patients – one of the largest osteoarthritis datasets in the world, the institute said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The AI "outperforms" comparable tools as it is nine times faster and more compact, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Osteoarthritis is the leading cause of disability in older adults, the university said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Researchers said the work could pave the way for similar tools in other chronic conditions, such as predicting lung damage in smokers or tracking heart disease, allowing doctors to act early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The university said it would be seeking partnerships to bring the technology into real-world clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 15:43:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5DV19zZkUySzBkSTJBRWowTEQ1cDRLYU9GSmpWT0lqd0ltc1RiT1pEWXIwdmczdjBTLWNtS0Z6Q2lnRHlHNDBLeDlQRG9nbWxvSGFmNFkzWGdjUdIBX0FVX3lxTE9sRVEzSlBSOXNPalFCazRzYWZMbGxCcGNuNHhQbDBfREo2cmV4cG9URF9xN2IzdDdoVjE2TmF3bU1oaFQyekhabGpHS3NVM2ZHeG5oSGwyRmlSakJncG9J</guid></item><item><title>耳堵塞是肿块罕见脑肿瘤的第一个征兆。父亲- TODAY.com</title><link>https://www.today.com/health/men-s-health/father-brain-tumor-first-symptoms-clogged-ear-rcna236668</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2f45c6" class="body-graf"&gt;For Stephen Greene, an attorney and father of two, the first symptoms of a brain tumor were subtle — and not obviously linked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-96d880" class="body-graf"&gt;He first noticed a tingling on the right side of his tongue and a slight loss of hearing in his right ear during the spring of 2024, when he was 44 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1e8aff" class="body-graf"&gt;"I thought maybe I had a little bit of earwax or water in my ear, or I thought maybe I was &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/long-covid-symptoms-rcna141441" target="_blank"&gt;getting over COVID&lt;/a&gt;," Greene, of Medfield, Massachussetts, tells TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d0c145" class="body-graf"&gt;Greene went to his doctor, who didn't notice anything obviously wrong with Greene's ear, and sent him to an ear, nose and throat doctor.

The tongue thing persisted, but didn't get worse," he says. But by the time winter rolled around, Greene noticed his &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/womens-health/npr-mary-louise-kelly-hearing-loss-rcna78925" target="_blank"&gt;hearing had gotten significantly worse&lt;/a&gt; in that ear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-865ab6" class="body-graf"&gt;Greene and his wife go out to dinner once a week, and he'd started to notice that, "if I was not on her right side, I couldn't hear the conversation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e22e94" class="body-graf"&gt;At that point, he says, "I realized my hearing was going on the right side, and at the same time, that numbness was spreading to my cheek area from just the tongue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dbc712" class="body-graf"&gt;This time, his doctor sent him to a different ENT, who suspected the issue may be brain-related and recommended Greene get an MRI and see a neurologist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3dc3ac" class="body-graf"&gt;On April 11, 2025, almost exactly a year after his symptoms first began, Greene went for the brain MRI, which confirmed that the issue was neurological: Greene had a nearly golf ball-sized tumor pressing on the nerves responsible for hearing and facial sensations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-99b6c7" class="body-heading"&gt;An MRI Revealed a Brain Tumor &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f39adf" class="body-graf"&gt;Greene was diagnosed with a vestibular schwannoma, a type of non-cancerous tumor that grows out of the lining of a nerve in the inner ear, Dr. Omar Arnaout, a neurosurgeon who specializes in treating these tumors at Mass General Brigham, tells TODAY.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a5efe4" class="body-graf"&gt;Specifically, the tumor develops from Schwann cells, which form the insulated lining of the vestibular nerves that are responsible for balance. But the vestibular nerves share that small inner ear canal with other nerves, including those responsible for hearing and facial sensations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eb3f04" class="body-graf"&gt;Of those nerves, the hearing nerve "is very fragile," Arnaout explains. "It's the most sensitive." So, a tumor that grows on the vestibular nerve is likely to press on the hearing nerve and cause symptoms there first, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cae1cf" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, the symptoms of a &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/what-acoustic-neuroma-dad-35-diagnosed-brain-tumor-t216069" target="_blank"&gt;vestibular schwannoma&lt;/a&gt; (also called a vestibular neuroma) tend to be less dramatic than those of other brain tumors, like &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/mom-severe-headaches-brain-tumor-rcna95149" target="_blank"&gt;glioblastomas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-73f6e0" class="body-graf"&gt;“These are slow-growing, benign tumors, and the symptoms tend to be pretty subtle," Arnaout explains. "So it’s very common for people to go a while before they get diagnosed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ae6e89" class="body-graf"&gt;A story like Greene's — a young, otherwise healthy person with subtle symptoms — is typical for patients who end up being diagnosed with this type of tumor, Arnaout says. Often, the first symptom is either decreased hearing, like Greene experienced, or tinnitus, a type of ringing or buzzing in the ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2e2a9f" class="body-graf"&gt;At first, people typically ignore these early mild symptoms, Arnaout says. But they don't go away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-743193" class="body-graf"&gt;After a while, "the natural thing to do is to get a hearing test," he explains, "and the test actually reveals a certain pattern of hearing loss that is associated more often than not with a tumor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8ee2d9" class="body-graf"&gt;In Greene's case, he underwent two hearing tests. The first, in the spring of 2024, showed that he did have reduced hearing in one ear, but it was still within the range of normal, he recalls. The second happened the day before his MRI, at which point his hearing loss was much more profound. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7be528" class="body-graf"&gt;"It was very frustrating because I could hear that a sound was being made, but I couldn't distinguish what word was being spoken," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-39fff8" class="body-heading"&gt;A Lengthy, Delicate Surgery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4f6ffe" class="body-graf"&gt;When these tumors are smaller, doctors might leave them alone and just monitor them, Arnaout says.

These subtle movements may offer vital insights into aging and conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Cardiovascular Research&lt;/em&gt;, the study presents the first noninvasive approach for measuring "microvascular volumetric pulsatility" -- the rhythmic swelling and shrinking of tiny blood vessels -- in living humans. Using ultra-high field 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the researchers found that these microvessel pulses become stronger with age, particularly in the brain's deep white matter. This region is essential for communication between brain networks but is also vulnerable to reduced blood flow from distal arteries, which carry blood from the heart to the outermost parts of the body. As these pulses intensify, they may interfere with brain function and contribute to memory decline and Alzheimer's progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Arterial pulsation is like the brain's natural pump, helping to move fluids and clear waste," said Danny JJ Wang, PhD, professor of neurology and radiology at the Keck School of Medicine and senior author of the study. "Our new method allows us to see, for the first time in people, how the volumes of those tiny blood vessels change with aging and vascular risk factors. This opens new avenues for studying brain health, dementia, and small vessel disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long recognized that stiffness and excessive pulsation in large arteries are linked to stroke, dementia, and small vessel disease. However, until now, it has been nearly impossible to observe these rhythmic changes in the brain's smallest vessels without using invasive procedures limited to animal studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome this, the USC team combined two advanced MRI techniques -- vascular space occupancy (VASO) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) -- to monitor subtle shifts in microvessel volume throughout the cardiac cycle. Their results revealed that older adults exhibit stronger microvascular pulsations in deep white matter compared to younger individuals, and that hypertension further intensifies these effects. "These findings provide a missing link between what we see in large vessel imaging and the microvascular damage we observe in aging and Alzheimer's disease," said lead author Fanhua Guo, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in Wang's lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive vascular pulsation may also disrupt the brain's "glymphatic system," a recently discovered network that removes waste substances such as beta-amyloid, a protein that accumulates in Alzheimer's disease. Over time, interference with this fluid circulation could hasten cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Being able to measure these tiny vascular pulses in vivo is a critical step forward," said Arthur W. Toga, PhD, director of the Stevens INI. "This technology not only advances our understanding of brain aging but also holds promise for early diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative disorders."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers are exploring how the method could be adapted for wider clinical use, including on more commonly available 3T MRI scanners. Future studies will test whether microvascular volumetric pulsatility predicts cognitive outcomes and whether it can serve as a biomarker for early intervention in Alzheimer's disease and related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is just the beginning," Wang said. "Our goal is to bring this from research labs into clinical practice, where it could guide diagnosis, prevention, and treatment strategies for millions at risk of dementia."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Wang, the study's other authors are Fanhua Guo, Chenyang Zhao, Qinyang Shou, Kay Jann, and Xingfeng Shao from the Stevens INI, and Ning Jin from Siemens Healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

This progressive loss of brain cells leads to severe symptoms including memory decline, cognitive impairment, and difficulty with movement. Over time, these conditions can greatly diminish quality of life and often leave patients dependent on continuous care. Current medications can help ease symptoms but do not stop or reverse the underlying disease, highlighting the urgent need for new therapeutic approaches. One promising strategy focuses on stimulating neuronal differentiation, the process of forming new neurons that could replace those lost and potentially slow or counteract neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin K, a fat-soluble nutrient best known for its role in blood clotting and bone health, has recently attracted attention for its influence on brain cell development and protection. However, naturally occurring vitamin K forms such as menaquinone 4 (MK-4) may not be potent enough for effective use in regenerative therapies targeting neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking study published in &lt;em&gt;ACS Chemical Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, researchers from the Department of Bioscience and Engineering at Shibaura Institute of Technology in Japan, led by Associate Professor Yoshihisa Hirota and Professor Yoshitomo Suhara, created and tested new vitamin K analogues with stronger neuroactive effects. The team also identified a distinct mechanism through which vitamin K promotes neuronal differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explaining their findings, Dr. Hirota noted, "The newly synthesized vitamin K analogues demonstrated approximately threefold greater potency in inducing the differentiation of neural progenitor cells into neurons compared to natural vitamin K. Since neuronal loss is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, these analogues may serve as regenerative agents that help replenish lost neurons and restore brain function."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To boost vitamin K's biological impact, the team produced 12 hybrid vitamin K homologs by linking them with retinoic acid (an active metabolite of vitamin A that encourages neuronal differentiation), a carboxylic acid group, or a methyl ester side chain. They then evaluated how effectively each compound promoted neuronal differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin K and retinoic acid influence gene transcription through the steroid and xenobiotic receptor (SXR) and retinoic acid receptor (RAR), respectively. The researchers measured SXR and RAR activity in mouse neural progenitor cells treated with the newly developed compounds and found that the hybrids maintained the biological functions of both parent molecules. They also measured the expression of microtubule-associated protein 2 (Map2), a neuronal growth marker, to track cell differentiation. One compound, which combined retinoic acid with a methyl ester side chain, produced a threefold increase in neuronal differentiation compared with the control and showed significantly stronger activity than natural vitamin K. This enhanced version was designated as the Novel vitamin K analog (Novel VK).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand how vitamin K protects neurons, the team compared gene expression patterns in neural stem cells treated with MK-4, which promotes neuronal differentiation, to those treated with a compound that suppresses it. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that vitamin K-induced neuronal differentiation is mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) through downstream epigenetic and transcriptional processes. The effect of MK-4 was specifically linked to mGluR1. Previous studies have shown that mGluR1 plays a key role in synaptic communication, and that mice lacking this receptor experience motor and synaptic impairments similar to those seen in neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delving deeper, the researchers conducted structural simulations and molecular docking studies to elucidate whether the vitamin K homolog interacts with mGluR1. Indeed, their analysis revealed a stronger binding affinity between Novel VK and mGluR1. Finally, the researchers examined the cellular uptake of Novel VK and its conversion to bioactive MK-4 in cells and mice. They noted a significant concentration-dependent increase in the intracellular concentration of MK-4. Moreover, Novel VK converted to MK-4 more easily than natural vitamin K. Further, &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments in mice showed that Novel VK exhibited a stable pharmacokinetic profile, crossed the blood-brain barrier, and achieved higher MK-4 concentration in the brain compared to the control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the study sheds light on the mechanism by which vitamin K and its structural analogues exert neuroprotective effects, paving the way for the development of novel therapeutic agents that can delay or reverse neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concluding with the long-term implications of their work, Dr. Hirota says, "Our research offers a potentially groundbreaking approach to treating neurodegenerative diseases. A vitamin K-derived drug that slows the progression of Alzheimer's disease or improves its symptoms could not only improve the quality of life for patients and their families but also significantly reduce the growing societal burden of healthcare expenditures and long-term caregiving."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope their research translates into clinically meaningful treatments for patients battling neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Given the precarious state of public health agencies under the Orange Menace, it is my hope that the information &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; can be infectious, spread widely to all your contacts, in the hope of promoting self-defense from disease. Knowledge is the best inoculation against misinformation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is from our new 19th newsletter, all about perimenopause and menopause. Feel less alone and more informed as you navigate this season of life. &lt;a href="https://19thnews.org/newsletters/menopause/"&gt;Subscribe today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone on Instagram — and walking down the sidewalk or around the playground — seems to be wearing a weighted vest. Everyone but me.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forbes &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2025/08/19/weighted-vests-are-now-a-fitness-trend-heres-what-you-need-to-know/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the weighted vest market generated $205 million in 2024, and that number is expected to be even higher for 2025. So it’s not all in my head: They’re big business, and American women are happily buying in. A political pollster recently found that &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/19/weighted-vest-women-are-the-2026-swing-voters-00572657"&gt;1 in 6 American women&lt;/a&gt; has one. &lt;/p&gt;


  

  
      
  





&lt;p&gt;That has made me feel a little left out and paranoid. Was I doing a major disservice to my health by not strapping [checks notes] three to 30 pounds to my back to walk around my neighborhood? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cue the expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So I reached out to &lt;a href="https://www.scranton.edu/directory/profiles/health-and-human-performance/joan-grossman.shtml"&gt;Joan Grossman&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, a registered dietitian/nutritionist who is also an associate professor of health and human performance at the University of Scranton. Her research focuses on how various forms of exercise impact post-menopausal body composition and performance. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Grossman said that when it comes to health and longevity, the most important thing is daily body resistance training, or strength training. Such training — using resistance to build muscle strength — is critical for bone health, heart health and metabolic health; research has found that women who engage in regular strength training live longer. It helps preserve the lean muscle mass that’s important for health but decreases with age. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But don’t get daunted: What Grossman has replicated in her research multiple times over is that 15 minutes a day of strength training is all it takes to elicit real body composition change. This most likely will look like basic exercises that you’re already familiar with: squats, lunges, push-ups and bicep curls are all forms of strength training.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enter the current chatter about weighted vests, often touted as a way for women to get that strength training they need to protect their bone health and build lean muscle mass. But there’s actually really limited research on weighted vests themselves, especially on whether they provide strength training benefits the same way that lifting weights or engaging in even body weight exercises does. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s known so far is that there seem to be &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39525516/"&gt;cardiovascular benefits&lt;/a&gt; from walking with a weighted vest. But a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22338922/"&gt;small study&lt;/a&gt; done by Thai researchers found no difference in bone health between those who walked with weighted vests and those who walked without. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s probably because the best exercises for bone density and lean muscle mass are those that involve executing a full range of body motion while utilizing significant resistance. (Think: a series of lunges while holding hand weights.)&lt;/p&gt;


  







&lt;p&gt;“You have to tug on those muscles in order for the muscles to require that metabolic demand,” Grossman said. “And when I say tug on them, I mean you have to use them. It takes work.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the trick is to &lt;em&gt;keep &lt;/em&gt;using them in this way, even as you continue to age. (Yes, Grossman said — you can definitely be 75 and doing a full body squat. And the best way to ensure that’s possible then? Start practicing now.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, could a weighted vest help with this? Maybe, but the research is far from definitive. And should you buy a weighted vest? Sure, if you want to. But do you need to? Not necessarily. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Grossman also advises some caution: There’s also a risk of injury with weighted vests — whether from strain or loss of balance — especially if people are wearing them while doing other forms of resistance training at a gym with little experience. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So why &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;weighted vests everywhere? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I wanted to unpack what to make of their overwhelming popularity. I called &lt;a href="https://www.newschool.edu/lang/faculty/natalia-mehlman-petrzela/"&gt;Natalia Mehlman Petrzela&lt;/a&gt;, a historian, associate professor at The New School and the author of “&lt;a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/F/bo184287097.html"&gt;Fit Nation: The Gains and Pains of America’s Exercise Obsession&lt;/a&gt;.” She’s a woman in her 40s and so she also sees weighted vests all around her. And when she sees them, she thinks about the ThighMaster. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fitness in the United States “is primarily a marketplace, and there is always a new product being marketed,” she said. Weighted vests are just the latest magic cure for all that ails you as you age — weight gain! loss of bone density! loss of muscle tone! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What feels new, though, is that the product also promises to maximize your productivity. “The fact that a weighted vest is a device that you can just put on when you’re just walking around suggests that just walking around isn’t good enough, that you actually should be optimizing that time on your feet to &lt;em&gt;also &lt;/em&gt;be working out at the same time,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="ups-block__single-article__inner"&gt;
              &lt;ul class="ups-block__single-article__list wp-block-single-article-grid"&gt;
                                                      &lt;li class="ups-block__single-article__head wp-block-single-article-grid__item"&gt;
                    &lt;span class=" mobile-show"&gt;
                        More From Jennifer Gerson:
                    &lt;/span&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;figure class=""&gt;
                            
                            &lt;/figure&gt;
                                                            &lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li class="ups-block__single-article__item wp-block-single-article-grid__item"&gt;
                
            &lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The immense popularity of weighted vests is also a sign of a change in how society sees middle-aged women.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s this thorny thing happening where there is this shift from seeing women past a certain age as invisible and unattractive and unworthy of any sort of attention to now seeing them as women who can be sexually attractive and have desires and deserve to feel good,” Mehlman Petrzela said. “I think the double-edged sword of that is that there’s this constant pressure to work on yourself and that now, when you’re 55, you actually still have a lot of pressure to look hot and work out all the time and feel great and be working on yourself and not let yourself go — that pressure didn’t exist in, say, 1960 or even 1990.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a whole other weight to carry. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mehlman Petrzela said that when she sees women walking in her neighborhood wearing weighted vests, she commends them on their commitment to caring for themselves and prioritizing health. But also:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It feels a little bit like this Army of Women who are never allowed to stop working on their fitness, even when they’re going about their day. The idea or the reality that we women who are already carrying so much are now carrying an extra burden to do all of that can sometimes feel, well, a little much.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaking of a little much&lt;/strong&gt; … &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a few weeks, we’re going to be talking about something I have been hearing a lot about from my peers IRL: the dynamic of a mother going through perimenopause living in the same household as a daughter going through puberty and what so many hormones under one roof can look and feel like. (I have a middle schooler myself so … yes.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Is this also you? &lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a0c3cfcdcdd5cec9d4d9e09199d4c8cec5d7d38ecfd2c7"&gt;Please write to me&lt;/a&gt;! I would love to speak with you for this upcoming edition about what you’re experiencing — and what you’re learning about yourself and your child in real time as you change, together. &lt;/p&gt;

So I started to look for a solution to fix that,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael’s girlfriend, Lana, has enjoyed participating in his experiments. “ It’s just very interesting,” she says. “He revealed to me that he was taking his concoction. We experimented with different dosages of everything and saw what that did, so that was kind of cool.” Michael and Lana asked to use pseudonyms to protect their privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lana is not alone among women in preferring more semen. Both Steven and Mike began supplementing after their girlfriends reacted negatively to the small size of their loads. “There are plenty of women who like cum and like to have it on their bodies,” says &lt;em&gt;Good Sex&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74LGNawQJq0&amp;amp;"&gt;Neal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My guess is that the majority of women probably don’t mind having a little bit more ejaculate from their partner,” Neal says. “And I would guess that there’s a not insubstantial subsection of women who actually really would love to have more ejaculate from their partner.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many men find that their partners do not appreciate their newfound talent. Marcus’s post “&lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/cumbiggerloads/comments/17n38w0/hookup_said_my_loads_are_disgusting_lmao/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.reddit.com/r/cumbiggerloads/comments/17n38w0/hookup_said_my_loads_are_disgusting_lmao/"}' href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cumbiggerloads/comments/17n38w0/hookup_said_my_loads_are_disgusting_lmao/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hookup said my loads are disgusting lmao&lt;/a&gt;” is one of the all-time top posts on the subreddit. “As I’ve gotten older, I’ve encountered very few sexual partners that are truly into it,” Marcus says. “Some of them seem to tolerate it more than anything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hink finds that increased load size is a niche area of self-improvement in his community. “Most men are far more concerned with getting a bigger penis, better erections, and lasting longer,” Hink says. “A lot of girls don’t like semen and don’t want a mouth full of semen. So, this is, I think, a little more selfish.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But achieving more semen volume is more attainable than those other goals. “ It’s so much easier and there’s so much less risk, and quite honestly, it’s a lot cheaper,” Hink says. Ultimately, the desire for a larger load is the desire to satisfy oneself. “It’s the pièce de résistance,” Steven says. “It’s the reward for the job well done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxQcUNsdHhXMnVHQnhadEo0Nl9BUkx0Y0FaQTRJMU1KSEczMnQ2eFltT0kyUkgwdW9pS29zREpiamVzb2xJbXZxcUFyV01CbXl2OVYwNkl4MWRIOXJ5eHFYZkdXRkp4UnlhUWNLTElnaXNnQndYVE96YUNFbHJKdU5kVWlXUHQyajA</guid></item><item><title>日本宣布流感疫情—这对其他国家意味着什么-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03367-z</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03367-z/d41586-025-03367-z_51572084.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03367-z/d41586-025-03367-z_51572084.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="A crowd of mask wearing commuters on a busy street in Osaka City." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03367-z/d41586-025-03367-z_51572084.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Cases of influenza are surging in Japan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Kota Kawasaki/Yomiuri Shimbun via AP/Alamy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan’s health authorities have declared an influenza epidemic, with thousands of people infected with the respiratory virus. The number of infections is unusual for this time of year, researchers say, and could seed outbreaks in countries that are heading into winter in Asia and Europe — although it is unlikely to become a global pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 10 October, 6,013 cases of influenza virus have been reported in Japan. More than 100 schools have closed, and nearly half of the 287 people who were hospitalized for flu in September were children aged 14 or younger. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare declared a nationwide epidemic on 3 October. Outbreaks are classified as epidemics when the number of infections is higher than expected in a given area over a particular period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks of influenza virus tend to occur &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03666-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03666-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;seasonally each year&lt;/a&gt;, predominantly in winter across countries with temperate climates. In Japan, that usually occurs around the end of November. This year, the increase in people being treated for flu started five weeks earlier than usual, says Vinod Balasubramaniam, a molecular virologist at Monash University Malaysia in Subang Jaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan has had early starts to the flu season in the past few years, but not this early, says Ian Barr, a researcher and deputy director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, who is based in Melbourne, Australia. “You might see cases in October, but not epidemic-type numbers,” says Barr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03519-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03519-3" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Increasing international travel&lt;/a&gt; since the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01315-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01315-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; is one factor that could be behind the early start to the flu season, says Balasubramaniam. Other factors include climate change and a lack of exposure to the circulating virus, particularly for elderly people and young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information about which strains are circulating in Japan has not yet emerged, but Barr says the outbreaks there could be caused by a strain of influenza A, called H3N2, that surged in Australia and New Zealand over the past two months, coinciding with the end of winter in the Southern Hemisphere. People from Australia are travelling to Japan in huge numbers, he says, meaning there are more chances for virus transmission between hemispheres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In a recent viral clip, Mango’s mom shared what happened when her curious pup decided to help herself to a pair of black stockings. Rather than scolding her, Mango’s owner decided to enforce a lighthearted house rule: “You steal it, you wear it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The video opens with Mango proudly holding her mom’s stockings between her paws, looking both guilty and defiant. The on-screen text humorously reads, “Another episode of ‘You steal it, you wear it.’” Moments later, the camera cuts to Mango, who now wears the stockings on her hind legs like a runway model. The sight is both ridiculous and adorable as the fluffy Golden stands confidently, clearly unbothered by her new “outfit.” Her mom jokingly captioned the video, “Girl where did you even find these?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The combination of Mango’s calm demeanor and her unusual outfit had viewers howling with laughter. One user joked, “Wowww we were not prepared for that,” while another encouraged, “Now STRUT your stuff Mango!” Someone else chimed in, “I’m going to go snag something cute right now!!!!” as if inspired to join the trend. Another viewer added, “This needs to come with an NSFW warning,” referencing Mango’s “spicy” runway look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many praised her mom’s lighthearted way of handling a classic case of canine mischief. Some even commented that Mango looked “too confident” in her new wardrobe, while others admitted their dogs would never sit still long enough to pull off such a look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/194192-video-golden-retriever-steal-stockings-wear-mom" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video: Rescue Golden Retriever Follows Mom’s ‘You Steal It, You Wear It’ Rule &amp;amp; Here’s What Happens;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Video: Rescue Golden Retriever Follows Mom’s ‘You Steal It, You Wear It’ Rule &amp;amp; Here’s What Happens&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 13:18:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxPUUxEQ1hXX1R5NnF1YlFuc3VtUF9iOFNUVV9OZkNYa08zbEY3Ym9JbGhNZlVobzRWSXFPTE5xME04cl95WGhyelRNNVZoV2RwclBqX0tfVlBZUUdUU0NTVk1XeC1KUDRjUTI4a3JyQjlad21GSlRqSEpwLWRheWEzaXFfOWlWdm5oVzVyMy1KNVNTZ0JrcjBNRA</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现了用于停止慢性疼痛的潜在关闭按钮- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/scientists-found-potential-off-button-120000575.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Scientists Found an Off Button for Chronic Pain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Victor Dyomin - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research has found that chronic pain begins in a certain group of neurons near the brainstem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the face of something that threatens survival, these neurons can produce a molecule that acts as a painkiller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could possibly find out how to develop a medication that activates this molecule for lasting relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arthritis.

He and his research team also found that there is a molecule that the brain can release for pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We focused on the lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPBN), a major entry point of sensory information from the periphery and the first site of integration of many affective behavioral states,” Betley said in a study recently published in the journal &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-09602-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Fscience%2Fhealth%2Fa69014450%2Fscientists-found-the-potential-off-button-for-stopping-chronic-pain%2F" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nature;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Populations of neurons in the lPBN […] respond to acute [pain-related] stimuli, and prolonged activation of excitatory lPBN neurons can drive a chronic pain-like state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9119955/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:parabrachial nucleus;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;parabrachial nucleus&lt;/a&gt; is made up of different neuron clusters in the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560589/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dorsolateral pons;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dorsolateral pons&lt;/a&gt; of the brainstem. Known as Y1R neurons, they transmit sensory information (such as taste and &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a23834/record-hot-years-could-be-new-normal-by-2025/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:temperature;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;temperature&lt;/a&gt;) in addition to pain, also regulating appetite and threat signals. While Y1R neurons exist in various subpopulations, what they have in common is the expression of receptors for &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00869/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neuropeptide Y or NPY;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;neuropeptide Y or NPY&lt;/a&gt;, which regulates types of brain activity like metabolism, heart rate, immune function, blood pressure, and even stress reduction. Other studies that involved monitoring neural activity and running computer models showed a link to chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Betley and his research team used painful stimuli (such as exposure to a hot surface) to activate Y1R neurons in mice, and as they predicted, the mice showed behaviors associated with persistent &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a33433129/neanderthal-low-pain-tolerance/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pain;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pain&lt;/a&gt;, such as paw licking. When the Y1R neurons were blocked, pain became much less persistent, and the mice only had short pain responses after being exposed to the same stimuli. There was one group of Y1R neurons that stayed active during licking, which suggests that a subpopulation of Y1R neurons is responsible for part of the Y1R response during extended periods of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Y1R neurons do not directly cause pain, they are thought to be involved in a larger network that is behind painful sensations. The way these neurons are organized allows them to receive sensory inputs, including pain signals sent from the spinal cord, which the neurons then send to multiple regions of the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a69001666/ultrasound-helmet-parkinsons-breakthrough/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain;cpos:12;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something else the researchers wanted to see was whether pain took precedence over survival. They temporarily deprived the mice of food and water and also introduced a frightening stimulus (like the scent of a &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a67955893/early-humans-eaten-by-leopards/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:predator;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;predator&lt;/a&gt;), and when faced with these perceived threats to their survival, the mice experienced significantly less pain. It turned out that production of neuropeptide Y increased in the parabrachial nucleus when the animals were faced with something that could literally mean life or death. Betley’s findings could mean that someday, a drug that signals neurons to produce more NPY could be a viable and safe alternative to painkillers such as opioids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This mechanism is an efficient and tunable system that enables urgent needs to shift brain state away from pain and towards other states that promote &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/math/a29653543/math-zombie-apocalypse/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:survival;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;survival&lt;/a&gt;,” he &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-09602-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Fscience%2Fhealth%2Fa69014450%2Fscientists-found-the-potential-off-button-for-stopping-chronic-pain%2F" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;cpos:15;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. “Future work could build from these findings to test other endogenous or pharmacological interventions that curb pain state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 13:12:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPc2tlQ0hZTHRDMVJLZmtEb2dpRnAyNFlRSUxoSnVWZk1xeTQ4WDJoS1VJT1Vad2dSQU5MdnNUTWRsTllFUkZ2MzBPTVdPcFVKM2t5YzI4NXBkMldBYy1rWGNqTS1TTXNWZ2s2anMyOUpvMzFheDNrRExFRGlNMklRXzVCQTJSTnFq</guid></item><item><title>简单的脂肪酸可以恢复失败的视力- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251014014307.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;Changes in eyesight are one of the most familiar effects of getting older. Sit in a dim restaurant with someone over 60, and you might hear, "Hold on -- let me pull out my cell phone. I need more light to read the menu!" But what if declining vision with age could actually be reversed?&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at UC Irvine have taken a closer look at that question, investigating a potential treatment aimed at slowing or even undoing "aging" in the eye while also preventing age-related diseases such as macular degeneration (AMD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We show the potential for reversing age-related vision loss," explains Dorota Skowronska-Krawczyk, PhD, an associate professor in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics and the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences. The study, conducted in partnership with scientists from the Polish Academy of Sciences and the Health and Medical University in Potsdam, Germany, presents findings published in &lt;em&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt; under the title "Retinal polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation reverses aging-related vision decline in mice."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding the "Aging" Gene&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research builds on earlier work involving the Elongation of Very Long Chain Fatty Acids Protein 2 (ELOVL2), a well-established biomarker of aging. "We showed that we have lower vision when this ELOVL2 enzyme isn't active," says Skowronska-Krawczyk, who is also part of the Robert M. Brunson Center for Translational Vision Research at the UC Irvine School of Medicine. In that previous study, boosting ELOVL2 activity in aging mice increased levels of the omega−3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the eye and led to better vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new research aimed to find a way to achieve similar benefits without depending on the ELOVL2 enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people age, changes in lipid metabolism reduce the amount of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLC-PUFAs) in the retina. This decline can impair vision and contribute to AMD. The ELOVL2 gene plays a crucial role in producing both VLC-PUFAs and DHA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When researchers injected older mice with a specific polyunsaturated fatty acid, their visual performance improved. "It's a proof-of-concept for turning lipid injection into a possible therapy," says Skowronska-Krawczyk. "What is important is that we didn't see the same effect with DHA." Others have also questioned the ability of DHA to slow AMD progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our work really confirms the fact that DHA alone cannot do the work, but we have this other fatty acid that is seemingly working and improving vision in aged animals," says Skowronska-Krawczyk. "We have also shown on a molecular level that it actually reverses the aging features."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the researchers found genetic variants in the ELOVL2 enzyme that correlate with faster progression of AMD. "Now we actually have a genetic connection to the disease and its aging aspect," says Skowronska-Krawczyk, "so we could potentially identify people at higher risk for vision loss progression." This could lead to not only therapeutic treatment options but also targeted interventions for prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings have only further solidified Skowronska-Krawczyk's view of the importance of the ELOVL2 enzyme. "I am pretty convinced it's one of the top aging genes that we should look at when we think about anti-aging therapies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking Beyond the Retina&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a collaboration with researchers from UC San Diego, Skowronska-Krawczyk has also started to explore the role of lipid metabolism in immune system aging. That study found that the lack of ELOVL2 enzyme induces accelerated aging of immune cells, suggesting that systemic lipid supplementation could potentially counteract the effects of age on the immune system. It also suggested that lipid metabolism might play a role in blood cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our first study explored a potential therapy to address vision loss," says Skowronska-Krawczyk, "but with the information we've since learned about immune aging, we are hopeful the supplementation therapy will boost the immune system as well."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

It's different for all of us and may even differ from day to day. A myriad of factors impact when we eat, from our work schedules to our social calendars and those of our family members. Whether we're eating out, cooking at home, or ordering takeout also can affect our plans. There's also personal preference: Tasting Table surveyed readers on &lt;a href="https://www.tastingtable.com/1158971/what-time-do-you-prefer-to-eat-dinner-exclusive-survey/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the preferred time to eat dinner;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;the preferred time to eat dinner&lt;/a&gt;, and answers ranged from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. But the question remains, is there, in fact, a time we should be aiming for, and how important is a consistent time to our digestion and other health factors? To find out, we consulted an expert, &lt;a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-y4p&amp;amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;amp;contentUuid=8931d6b0-18b1-3310-beb1-fed1c0a43f67&amp;amp;featureId=text-link&amp;amp;linkText=Lena+Bakovic&amp;amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2xldHNsaXZlaXR1cC5jb20vcGFnZXMvbGVuYS1iYWtvdmljIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4OTMxZDZiMC0xOGIxLTMzMTAtYmViMS1mZWQxYzBhNDNmNjciLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vbGV0c2xpdmVpdHVwLmNvbS9wYWdlcy9sZW5hLWJha292aWMifQ&amp;amp;signature=AQAAAUclh73U8Ouz_xwB8vkl0R1XTVfYKsMm5IFTxF7G02w5&amp;amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fletsliveitup.com%2Fpages%2Flena-bakovic&amp;amp;spaceId=980751755" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lena Bakovic;elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Lena Bakovic&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN, CNSC at Live It Up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"In my opinion, dinner should ideally be consumed at least two hours prior to bedtime (and sometimes slightly longer, depending on the individual)," Bakovic says. "This strategic timing aids with providing our digestive systems sufficient time to digest and absorb nutrients, while also helping to prevent symptoms of reflux or negatively impacting sleep." If your body hasn't had ample time to digest when you lie down, it could result in stomach pains, heartburn, and acid reflux. Plus, the calories that your body would normally convert into fuel during the day just get stored as fat if you're about to go to bed. This can lead to weight gain, while acid reflux can accumulate into long-term issues like asthma and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Read more: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/10-foods-gordon-ramsay-doesnt-122000054.html" data-ylk="slk:10 Foods Gordon Ramsay Doesn't Touch;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;10 Foods Gordon Ramsay Doesn't Touch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How late is too late for dinner?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woman eating spaghetti at table - D3sign/Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That potential indigestion-related discomfort, Bakovic says, "may, in some respects, be due to the metabolic activity required to digest and absorb food." She explains, "Eating too late can also alter hormonal balance, namely insulin levels, unusually affecting blood sugar ebbs and flows." Insulin is the hormone that turns sugar into energy; it's receptive in the morning to get you ready for the day but not so much at night. Hormones that regulate your appetite and your metabolism follow your circadian rhythm, so if you push against this by eating when your body thinks it's time for bed, the way your body generates energy and feels hungry and full gets thrown off. This could lead to health issues like type 2 diabetes down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, that doesn't mean you have to eat at 5 p.m. if you go to bed at 9:30 p.m. "Eating dinner too early can set us up to eat more food later, in larger portions, and in late evenings or close to bedtime," Bakovic adds. Overcorrecting can just land you back in the position of needing to eat another meal later. The right dinnertime is about balance. This can take dedicated scheduling, but the health benefits are worthwhile. "Generally speaking, smaller and more frequent meals are usually quite easier to digest," the expert adds, "which can help with stabilizing energy levels." Flexibility is key in the long run, as we all know the day can get away from us.

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Seafood&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Generally, the health benefits of fish make certain types of seafood worth the higher price. “Consuming two servings of fish per week has been shown to help lower the risk of heart disease,” says Amy Woodman, owner and dietitian at Farmington Valley Nutrition and Wellness in Simsbury, Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Salmon, in particular, is rich in &lt;a href="/health/healthy-living/foods-high-in-omega-fatty-acids/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/money/personal-finance/2025/splurging-on-groceries.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP.

If you can afford it, Lupoli recommends buying wild-caught rather than farm-raised. “They are leaner and have more nutrients,” she says. “They’re just healthier fish. Because they are healthier, they are healthier for our bodies.”&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Wild salmon also has fewer calories, one-third the saturated fat of farmed salmon and fewer contaminants.﻿&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pro tip: &lt;/b&gt;Buying frozen fish rather than fresh can save you money, Sauceda says. Canned fish is also a more affordable option.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Nuts and seeds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;You’ll get the most nutritional bang for your buck with almonds, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, pecans and walnuts, according to the Mayo Clinic. Cashews and pistachios are also good options, Lupoli says. Choose raw and dry-roasted nuts instead of those cooked in oil.﻿&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Seeds, such as chia seeds, flax seeds and sunflower seeds, are a good source of protein﻿, fiber and omega-3 fatty acids, according to Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pro tip: &lt;/b&gt;When it comes to nuts and seeds, a little goes a long way, which can help keep costs — and calories — down. Eating a small handful of nuts a few times a week will provide health benefits, Lupoli says. And just a tablespoon of seeds per day offers a wealth of nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Protein supplements&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

However, more than 1 in 3 adults ages 51 and older aren’t getting enough protein in their diets, according to research published in &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Journal of Nutrition, Health and Aging&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The majority of his life was spent in the countryside, eluding urban air pollution. From 1956, however, he worked for a major company in crop protection and was, naturally, exposed to a variety of pesticides and farming chemicals. Could these have been the trigger? Curious, I approached Sonia Gandhi, a professor of neurology at University College London (UCL) and an assistant research director at the biomedicine charity the Francis Crick Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is understood that pesticides are included in the environmental factors linked to Parkinson’s disease, but it is not yet apparent whether they affect DLB. Gandhi states, however, that environmental toxins may play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pesticides affect the mitochondria of cells, causing a decline in the energy production – this is believed then to cause a bioenergetic deficit that puts the brain cells in a ‘stressed’ state in which proteins such as alpha-synuclein may misfold,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We cannot be certain that pesticides are the culprit for Grandpa’s DLB, or whether it is even possible for them to have been a catalyst decades before his diagnosis, but current work seeks to decipher the how and why of our environment’s role in neurodegenerative diseases. We may never know in Grandpa’s case, but there is hope for future patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, researchers from the Francis Crick Institute and UCL launched an ongoing project named Role of Air Pollution in Dementia (Rapid), which aims to uncover the specific process(es) of and conditions for PM2.5 to incite neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gandhi says: “Our work in Rapid is designed to examine a range of different hypotheses about how PM2.5 may affect brain health. What is clearly needed, though, is research that can understand the route of exposure, the timing and duration of exposures, the effect of combinations of exposures – as this is what happens in the ‘real world’ – and the actual mechanisms by which either pesticides or air pollution, or both, may affect the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For air pollution, we do not yet know the exact mechanisms – it may affect states of inflammation within the brain, or it may interact directly with the protein alpha-synuclein to change its propensity to aggregate or cause neurodegeneration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How PM2.5 triggers &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/dementia/midlife-medications-dementia/"&gt;neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/a&gt; is not yet determined, but what&lt;em&gt; is&lt;/em&gt; clear is that air quality, which is already linked to numerous chronic conditions, must be improved. Some pollution is unavoidable. We can’t put lids on volcanoes or snuff out every spore-spurting plant. But we do have the capacity to manage PM2.5 produced by human activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2010 sets legal limits for particulate matter concentrations to regulate our exposure to PM2.5, while the National Emission Ceilings Regulations 2018 places legal caps on air-pollutant emissions. Environmental policies must now consider the implications of this new research in neuroscience and make amendments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The idea that we may be able to prevent or delay the onset of a condition by changing our environment – this opens a new door in conditions that currently lack cure/disease-modifying therapies,” says Gandhi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weil comments: “This is an important and exciting research finding. It is important to find a potential cause for Lewy body dementia, and finding this link could provide a potential new avenue for treatments, which is what all the patients in my clinic are eager to see.”&lt;/p&gt;

His goldfish had died the year before. Their dog Copper had passed away a month earlier, and his mother Tricia Reagan tried to explain that the same thing happened to his half sister Sarah. But Copper had lived to 105 in dog years. Sarah Saponara was just 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;His mother said his sister took medication that wasn’t hers. It had dangerous stuff in it, and it made her die. Death, she explained, meant he wouldn’t see Sarah again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Two years passed before Miles and Tricia really talked about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; she died again. It would come up randomly — at the grocery store, the park and the zoo: “Tell me how Sarah died."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As Miles grew older, he had more questions: &lt;em&gt;Where did Sarah get the medicine? Did the doctor give it to her? Could all medicines hurt you? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Sibling grief is real and powerful, but it's often overlooked, especially when the grieving sibling is a young child. In the age of widespread access to drugs like fentanyl, overdose deaths have become a heartbreaking reality for more families.

She started seeking out other drugs to capture that same feeling. At first it was weed, then ketamine and Xanax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She struggled with bipolar disorder and ADHD, but when she was on drugs, she felt like her brain was balanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;By the time Sarah went to college, she didn’t have a drug of choice, but she was addicted to being in an altered state. She ended up dropping out after four semesters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;On an acid trip, she once threw herself out of a moving car on the highway. That was one of the times Tricia felt like she might lose her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Sarah’s addiction uprooted their lives. If Tricia had 100 metaphorical marbles to give to other people, she gave 96 of them to Sarah. At one point, Tricia was worried the person selling Sarah drugs would come to their house, and she sent Liliana, her then-13-year-old middle child, to go live with an uncle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The panic attacks, anxiety and anger hit Liliana in waves: &lt;em&gt;How could Sarah afford drugs, but not food? Why did she keep using? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It took years for her to truly understand the ways addiction had taken control of Sarah’s actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It was really heartbreaking to have to experience Sarah be so dismissive,” Liliana, now 18, says, “There was a lot of anger when she died.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Though they didn’t know the name for it at the time, they were experiencing anticipatory grief — the process of grieving a future loss, which can involve feelings of anxiety, sadness and anger. With overdose-specific loss, those feelings are often more complicated and grouped with the stigma of losing someone to substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It wasn't until after she died that I could say, we went through something horrific,” Tricia says. “It was freaking terrible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/13/USAT/86667389007-img-3271.jpeg?crop=3024,3549,x0,y356&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;height=353&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/13/USAT/86667389007-img-3271.jpeg?crop=3024,3549,x0,y356&amp;amp;width=600&amp;amp;height=706&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Sarah was the oldest of three siblings.

She was with her girlfriend and their roommate. Just hours after snorting the drug, Sarah awoke to find her girlfriend unresponsive beside her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Tricia got the call in the middle of the night: They were at the hospital, and Sarah's girlfriend was dead. She stayed by her daughter’s side. During a brief break to take a conference call, Tricia left the apartment. When she returned with lunch and knocked on Sarah's roommate's door, there was no answer. She and Sarah found him dead, too. A fatal overdose from the same batch of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Later, Sarah admitted they'd known the heroin had killed her girlfriend but had both used it again anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I couldn't understand why she would do that,” Tricia says. “From a distance, it's clear to me that substances have a power that I do not understand…. Her brain was no longer able to process it in a rational way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Six months later, Sarah was gone. She never forgave herself for surviving that tragedy, her mom says. She overdosed at least twice and was in the ER just three days before her death. What eventually killed her on Feb. 17, 2021, was a counterfeit Percocet, laced with fentanyl. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In that final year of Sarah’s life, Tricia hardly slept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Every morning, she checked Sarah’s location and social media. If too many hours went by without hearing from her, Tricia would drive by her apartment, heart racing, to check she was there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Even though she’d imagined the ways Sarah could die thousands of times, nothing compared to the wall of grief that hit her when it actually happened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Sarah had been the soundtrack to their lives. She played 17 instruments. At her rural conservative high school in Ashland, Virginia, she was the first openly gay member of the homecoming court and was voted class clown. When she died, it was like the music stopped. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Tricia wanted to collapse, but she had two other kids to raise. The fear was paralyzing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“One of the hardest things about parenting, when you've lost a kid to overdose, was (thinking) what role did I play in getting Sarah to where she was? And how can I make sure I don't make that same decision with my other children?" Tricia says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Liliana, seven years younger than Sarah, had memories. But Miles was just 4. How do you help a child grieve the sibling they barely knew? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/18/USAT/86219624007-overdoseloss-9.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=450&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/18/USAT/86219624007-overdoseloss-9.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;height=900&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Tricia sent Miles, 8, to a Comfort Zone Grief grief camp for kids 7 to 17 who have all lost a parent or sibling to overdose."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Tricia sent Miles, 8, to a Comfort Zone Grief grief camp for kids 7 to 17 who have all lost a parent or sibling to overdose." data-c-credit="Rachel Hale"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Parenting in the shadow of grief&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For Tricia, parenting now can feel scary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Today’s teens are navigating an ecosystem where counterfeit Oxycodone, Xanax, Percocet and Adderall are accessible on platforms like Facebook, Snapchat and Telegram.

She’s had three surgeries since Sarah died and was adamant with each one that she didn’t want to use opioids, despite pushback from doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“When I told them I didn't want to use opioids, it felt like they were diminishing me and my character,” Liliana says. “I wish more people knew opioids didn't have to be the norm.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In Liliana’s room, a neon lightning bolt lightly illuminates her bed. It was her sister’s. Sarah had once nearly been struck by lightning, and that Christmas, Tricia got her the lamp and a bracelet with a poem that read: "Believe me when I tell you that girls like you are made of lightning — hard to forget and remembered by all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There are often feelings of anger, regret and guilt that come with the loss of a loved one to overdose, and it’s important to seek out overdose-specific grief resources. When explaining an overdose death to a young child, it’s critical to tell the truth, even if it’s explained in simple terms, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.dougy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Dougy Center&lt;/a&gt;, which focuses on grief in children and families. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Tricia brings Liliana and Miles, now 8, to a local support group for those who have had a loss related to substance abuse through &lt;a href="https://fullcirclegc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Full Circle Grief Center&lt;/a&gt; and take part in the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/graplerva/?locale=bg_BG&amp;amp;_rdr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;GRAPLE Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, a peer-lead grief support group for losses related to substance use disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Tricia also sends Liliana and Miles to a &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/09/25/overdose-grief-camp-fills-up-with-kids-who-lost-parents-to-opioids/86199914007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Comfort Zone Grief camp&lt;/a&gt; for kids 7 to 17 who have all lost a parent or sibling to overdose, where she also participated in a parent program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;On the ride home from camp one year, Miles remarked to Tricia: “I don’t think I remember Sarah.

It finds its own quiet places to live. In the corner of their kitchen, there’s a small space that Miles calls “Sarah’s house.” Over the years, he’s filled it with little things for her: a few photos from family trips, small toys, and, one Christmas, a tiny doll bed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“She needs a bed in her house,” he told Tricia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She smiled and asked gently, “Do you think she sleeps there?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Miles shook his head. “No,” he said. “She’s in the stars.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you or someone you love is struggling with a substance use disorder contact the &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/helplines/national-helpline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;SAMHSA National Helpline&lt;/a&gt; at 1-800-662-HELP (4357) for information and resources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rachel Hale’s role covering Youth Mental Health at USA TODAY is supported by a partnership with Pivotal and Journalism Funding Partners.

  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;A Washington man appeared to be destined to develop &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nervous-system-health/alzheimers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; — but against all genetic odds, he has eluded the common dementia for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;Researchers at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis recently published a study focusing on Doug Whitney, 76, who lives near Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has a rare inherited &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/genetics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;genetic mutation&lt;/a&gt; in the presenilin 2 (PSEN2) gene, which virtually guarantees early-onset Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/study-reveals-why-super-agers-maintain-outstanding-memory-80s" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;STUDY REVEALS WHY ‘SUPER AGERS’ MAINTAIN ‘OUTSTANDING MEMORY’ INTO THEIR 80S&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of Whitney’s family members who inherited the gene have experienced cognitive decline starting in their early 50s or sooner, according to a WashU press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitney, however, shows no signs of mental decline. WashU researchers wondered if the reason for his continued cognitive health could help protect others against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doug Whitney, Alzheimer's research participant, appeared to be destined to develop Alzheimer’s disease — but against all genetic odds, he has eluded the common dementia for decades.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(UWash Medicine/Megan Farmer)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in the journal Nature Medicine, the researchers analyzed his genetic data and brain scans, identifying "changes in genes and proteins" that could explain how he has defied the odds to remain &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;mentally sharp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also discovered that Whitney’s brain had virtually no buildup of tau, the hallmark protein that signals the onset of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/new-mri-brain-scan-predicts-alzheimers-risk-years-before-symptoms-develop" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NEW MRI BRAIN SCAN PREDICTS ALZHEIMER'S RISK YEARS BEFORE SYMPTOMS DEVELOP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These extensive studies indicate a remarkable resistance to tau pathology and neurodegeneration," said senior study author Randall J. Bateman, M.D., the Charles F. and Joanne Knight Distinguished Professor of Neurology at WashU Medicine, in the press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urged by his cousin, Whitney first came to WashU in 2011 to participate in a study focused on families with inherited forms of Alzheimer’s, as many of his relatives had developed early-onset disease. At the time, he believed he did not have the gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;&lt;p class="quote-text"&gt;"He actually was able to escape the expected course of the disease."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitney’s mother was one of 14 children, nine of whom had the Alzheimer’s gene. Ten of them died before they were 60. Whitney’s own brother developed the disease before dying at age 55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was 61 at the time — well past the age where it should have onset," he told Fox News Digital during an on-camera interview. "But they tested me, and lo and behold, I did have the gene. I was amazed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a study published in the journal Nature Medicine, the researchers analyzed Whitney's genetic data and brain scans.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(UWash Medicine/Megan Farmer)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were just as "confounded," Whitney recalled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;tested me&lt;/a&gt; three times to make sure that there wasn't some slip-up. But it's true. I had the gene. And now I'm 76 years old and still haven't had any symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive clues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jorge Llibre-Guerra, M.D., an assistant professor of neurology and co-first author of the study, echoed that it was a "big surprise" to learn that Whitney was a carrier of the genetic mutation — officially known as an "exceptional resilience mutation carrier."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He actually was able to escape the expected course of the disease," he said in the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/omega-3-may-help-protect-women-from-alzheimers-disease-new-study-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;OMEGA-3 MAY HELP TO PROTECT WOMEN FROM ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE, NEW STUDY SAYS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, in this most recent study, the WashU researchers aimed to explore potential reasons for Whitney’s absence of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we are able to uncover the mechanism behind this resilience, we could try to replicate it with a targeted therapy designed to delay or prevent the onset of Alzheimer’s, leveraging the same &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;protective factors&lt;/a&gt; that have kept Mr. Whitney from developing this disease to benefit others," said Llibre-Guerra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doug and Ione Whitney often work on puzzles together to help maintain mental sharpness.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(UWash Medicine/Megan Farmer)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who have the PSEN2 mutation tend to have an "over-production" of amyloid protein, which &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/brain-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;builds up in the brain&lt;/a&gt; during the first stage of Alzheimer’s, according to the researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second stage, as symptoms of cognitive decline begin, there is typically a buildup of tau protein in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/missing-link-alzheimers-disease-found-study-human-brain-tissue" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;'MISSING LINK' TO ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE FOUND IN STUDY OF HUMAN BRAIN TISSUE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Whitney’s case, brain scans showed a "significant accumulation" of amyloid, but almost a complete absence of tau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One theory for how Whitney may have escaped his genetic fate stems from his time &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/navy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in the Navy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers discovered that Whitney’s brain (not pictured) had virtually no buildup of tau, the hallmark protein that signals the onset of cognitive decline.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers analyzed Whitney’s cerebrospinal fluid, they found a "a significantly higher-than-normal level" of "heat shock" proteins, protective molecules that cells produce when they’re under stress, including &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/heat-wave" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;high heat exposure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his many years of working as a shipboard mechanic in the Navy, Whitney was exposed to high temperatures for extended periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/dementia-risk-slashed-one-common-health-intervention-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;DEMENTIA RISK SLASHED WITH ONE COMMON HEALTH INTERVENTION, STUDY FINDS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the engine room of ships, the temperatures … would range from 100 to 110 degrees, for four hours at a time," he told Fox News Digital. "They concluded that possibly there was some gene or protein that could mutate and protect me genetically from the disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don’t yet understand how or if heat shock proteins may be mediating the effect," Llibre-Guerra noted in the release. "However, in this case, they may be involved in preventing aggregation and misfolding of tau proteins, but we do not know for sure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"They tested me three times to make sure that there wasn't some slip-up.

"I’m &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/fitness" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;pretty active&lt;/a&gt;, and I hardly have any medications to take."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who are experiencing symptoms, Whitney recommends contacting the Alzheimer's Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Get into research as soon as possible — the earlier you get in, the better chance you have," he said.

And that’s for something as low stakes as a vitamin D supplement; it’s not the end of the world if I’m a little deficient. But when it comes to HIV prevention, missing a dose of your prescribed daily prevention pills could mean the difference between protection and new infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A new drug called lenacapavir might entirely change the game, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Right now, our most widely used tool to stave off HIV — which &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet"&gt;killed an estimated 630,000 people&lt;/a&gt; last year — is through prevention pills, called pre-exposure prophylaxis. PrEP works extremely well and has prevented millions of HIV infections in the 13 years it’s been around. But the catch is that it needs to be taken every single day. In much of the Global South, having &lt;a href="https://www.prepwatch.org/resources/getting-prep-rollout-right/"&gt;consistent access to it remains a big hurdle&lt;/a&gt;, on top of issues with adherence and stigma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That’s the reason why, by 2023, only about 6 million people worldwide were on PrEP, a fraction of the tens of millions who could benefit. Each year, another 1.3 million people still acquire HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But a discreet shot taken &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; twice a year, like the newly approved lenacapavir, takes forgetfulness — and some stigma — out of the equation. For a field where breakthroughs have been rare, lenacapavir has almost vaccine-like efficacy (even though it’s not one). In clinical trials, the drug showed 100 percent protection in women and approximately 96 percent in men, transgender and nonbinary people. Those are the kind of numbers policymakers can’t ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The US Food and Drug Administration approved it in June, the World Health Organization endorsed it in July, and the European Union followed in August. And the Trump administration — which &lt;a href="/future-perfect/397399/usaid-omb-purge-government-agency-spending-leave"&gt;grounded its live-saving global health work to a complete stop&lt;/a&gt; eight months ago — has recently made lenacapavir the center of its “&lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/America-First-Global-Health-Strategy-Report.pdf"&gt;America First&lt;/a&gt;” global health strategy. The administration plans to roll out the drug in about a dozen low-income countries by early 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That’s all remarkable news. Low-income countries typically have had to wait decades, if not more, before newer, better drugs trickled down. This time, at least in theory, access could come almost simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But whether lenacapavir actually makes a dent in the HIV epidemic will depend less on science than on politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;AIDS-related deaths have dropped dramatically since 2005, in large part because of PEPFAR.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Council on Foreign Relations&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Four decades ago, an HIV infection was a near-death sentence. But since then, we’ve marched toward progress — making better drugs with simpler regimens and widening access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But even after all that work, we still don’t have a cure or a true vaccine. That’s why an innovation like lenacapavir feels notable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For years, HIV drugs targeted the virus’s enzymes, and it wasn’t obvious that targeting anything else would work. Then in the 1990s, researchers backed by the National Institutes of Health began studying how the virus builds its cone-shaped shell, called the capsid. Most &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/23/fda-approval-lenacapavir-yeztugo-gilead-history-development-breakthrough-william-pao/"&gt;scientists dismissed it&lt;/a&gt; as “undruggable” — a smooth protein structure with no obvious place for a medicine to stick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But a small band of virologists thought differently. They spent years hunting for a molecule that could jam the capsid’s formation. After countless dead ends, that hunch paid off: The work led to lenacapavir, the first drug to successfully attack the virus’s shell and block multiple steps in its life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;“This drug is extraordinary — the closest thing to a vaccine that we have.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z3"&gt;— Dr. Megan Ranney, Yale School of Public Health dean&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In a landmark clinical trial that began in 2021 and enrolled more than 2,000 teen girls and young women from South Africa and Uganda, no one who received lenacapavir contracted HIV. The effect was so striking that, in June 2024, an independent safety board told researchers to end the trial’s blinded phase early — continuing would’ve meant withholding an obviously effective drug from some participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“It would’ve been unethical not to,” said Linda-Gail Bekker, an infectious disease physician at the University of Cape Town and one of the trial’s lead investigators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Those numbers are really impressive, but lenacapavir’s efficacy as an injectable is another plus. In much of sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV burden is among the heaviest, injectable contraception is already the most widely used form of birth control. For many women, injections are more discreet and practical than taking a daily pill. “It’s a very recognized concept…injections are a very attractive option,” Bekker said. That familiarity could be the difference between a prevention tool that works in theory and one people actually use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As lenacapavir emerged from late-stage trials, with results showing near-perfect protection, the world took notice. In 2024, the editors of &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, the prestigious scientific journal, named lenacapavir their &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/breakthrough-2024#section_breakthrough"&gt;breakthrough of the year&lt;/a&gt;. “This drug is extraordinary — the closest thing to a vaccine that we have,” said Dr. Megan Ranney, the dean of the Yale School of Public Health and one of the &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; editors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A twice-yearly shot that can nearly eliminate new infections should be the stuff of celebration. Lenacapavir could mark the beginning of the end of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But as always in public health, the science is only half the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A breakthrough only matters if it gets off the shelf and reaches the people who need it most. And in much of the world, that depends on policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Since 2003, the US &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/pepfar/"&gt;President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief&lt;/a&gt;, or PEPFAR, has been an essential, global lever for HIV treatment access. PEPFAR is a George W. Bush-era program that has delivered lifesaving HIV treatment to poor countries and has &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/about-us-pepfar"&gt;helped save more than 25 million lives&lt;/a&gt; over its 22-year history. The program is funded by the US Congress, which renews its authority and budget — both of which can get caught up in politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When President Donald Trump returned to office in January, he ordered a &lt;a href="/future-perfect/402944/pepfar-hiv-donald-trump-elon-musk-global-health"&gt;broad freeze on US foreign aid, throwing PEPFAR into limbo&lt;/a&gt;. Grants were halted, drug shipments stalled and USAID — the program’s main implementer — was dismantled almost overnight, stoking fears that the world’s most successful HIV program was about to be killed off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Then last month, the administration announced its &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/releases/the-united-states-presidents-emergency-plan-for-aids-relief/2025/09/pepfar-commits-to-distributing-breakthrough-hiv-drug-lenacapavir-demonstrating-american-excellence-in-science-and-american-leadership-in-hiv-prevention"&gt;plans to revive PEPFAR&lt;/a&gt; to deliver the breakthrough drug lenacapavir. (But right now, it’s unclear how the ongoing government shutdown will affect PEPFAR funding.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The administration says it will prioritize delivering lenacapavir to pregnant and breastfeeding people in eight to 12 yet-to-be-announced countries, as part of Trump’s push to &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/09/department-of-state-gilead-sciences-and-the-global-fund-announcement-of-lifesaving-and-innovative-pepfar-initiative/"&gt;end mother-to-child transmission of HIV&lt;/a&gt; by the end of his term. On paper, that’s a tidy goal — two injections can protect both mother and baby through pregnancy and nursing — but advocates say that choice isn’t rooted in science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In sub-Saharan Africa, young women, broadly, account for the majority of new infections, and elsewhere, it’s gay and bisexual men, trans people, sex workers, and people who use drugs — those who were disproportionately infected and died in the early decades of the HIV epidemic. Now, channeling the new drug only through maternal health programs risks leaving those communities out yet again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Prioritizing pregnant and breastfeeding people is ideological, not scientific,” said Asia Russell of &lt;a href="https://healthgap.org/"&gt;HealthGAP&lt;/a&gt;, a New York City-based AIDS advocacy organization. “They’re a very, very small fraction of those at risk.” In sub-Saharan Africa, pregnant and breastfeeding people face real risk — a few out of every hundred contract HIV each year — but they’re still a small slice of a larger epidemic that’s largely driven by young women and queer men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Patients wait to be seen at the maternal and child health unit at Kuoyo Sub-county Hospital in Kisumu, Kenya — a region with one of the highest HIV rates in the country. Clinics like this have been hit hard by recent US aid freezes, leaving gaps in care and prevention.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Michel Lunanga/Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;State Department official Jeremy Lewin also made their philosophy clear during the administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/09/department-of-state-gilead-sciences-and-the-global-fund-announcement-of-lifesaving-and-innovative-pepfar-initiative"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt;. “There are no NGOs involved in this — none of those sort of beltway bandits here,” he said, referring to the aid groups that have traditionally implemented US-funded HIV programs. (It’s a loaded term and a misleading one, given that &lt;a href="https://www.stateoig.gov/uploads/report/report_pdf_file/fy-2024-coordinated-pepfar-oversight-plan.pdf"&gt;oversight bodies&lt;/a&gt; haven’t uncovered corruption at scale.) “It’s going to be the countries [who are] responsible for distributing it through their national healthcare systems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That might sound efficient in Washington, but it’s more complicated on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That’s because HIV isn’t like cholera or the flu — something you can beat with a one-size-fits-all campaign. It affects some groups more than others and carries deep stigma, because it’s tied to sex, sexuality, and drug use, all of which are moralized in many societies. And in many countries, the state is the very institution that enforces, even criminalizes, that stigma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Bekker, who runs an HIV research center in South Africa, said that even in places without formal bans, public clinics can feel hostile to sexual and gender minorities. “The result,” she said, “is that people just don’t show up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://files.kff.org/attachment/Issue-Brief-Key-Issues-and-Questions-for-PEPFARs-Future.pdf"&gt;PEPFAR’s own history&lt;/a&gt; shows that prevention works best when community-led groups such as LGBTQ+ clinics or drop-in centers are included in the response. Those are the spaces that reach groups left out by official systems. Jirair Ratevosian, a former senior PEPFAR adviser, said ending infant infections is crucial, but so is supporting community- and faith-based clinics “where people actually feel safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Gilead Sciences, headquartered in Foster City, California, developed lenacapavir — the twice-yearly HIV prevention shot now at the center of the US rollout.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Besides the Trump administration (and all its political theater), there’s one more key player: Gilead Sciences, the California-based company that developed lenacapavir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In September, Gilead made two big promises. First, it agreed to sell lenacapavir to PEPFAR at “&lt;a href="https://www.gilead.com/news/news-details/2025/gilead-announces-partnership-with-pepfar-to-deliver-twice-yearly-lenacapavir-for-hiv-prevention-for-up-to-two-million-people-in-primarily-low--and-lower-middle-income-countries"&gt;no profit&lt;/a&gt;,” although it’s unclear what that actually means. Second — and more importantly — it signed licensing deals with six generic manufacturers, sharing its technology so those companies can start preparing to make cheaper versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Typically, drug companies fiercely guard new medicines under patents for 20 years, during which time they alone can make and sell the drugs — and only countries that can afford the list price get access. Once those patents expire, generics can enter the market and drive costs down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;By making these licensing deals, Gilead is trying to shorten that wait time so, if all goes to plan, poorer countries could get lenacapavir in just a few years instead of decades later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The licensing deal allows generics to be sold in 120 low- and lower-middle-income countries, covering most of the world’s poorest nations. Once those versions hit the market, they’ll cost a fraction of Gilead’s price tag — which in the US is $28,128 a year per patient, though few people pay that sticker price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But the deal leaves out many upper-middle-income countries such as Brazil or Argentina, where infections have been rising. Those nations fall into a gray zone — too rich for cheap generics, too poor to afford Gilead’s prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For Gilead, a for-profit company, sharing its drug formula with generic makers might sound generous, but it’s not as straightforward as it looks. The licenses “carve the world into low-value markets where generics can operate [where Gilead won’t be making money anyway], and profitable ones where Gilead keeps its grip,” said Tahir Amin, an intellectual-property lawyer and co-founder of &lt;a href="https://www.i-mak.org/"&gt;Initiative for Medicines, Access, and Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit that advocates for patent reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Meanwhile, major philanthropists — the &lt;a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/media-center/press-releases/2025/09/hiv-prevention-lenacapavir"&gt;Gates Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://unitaid.org/news-blog/lenacapavir-for-hiv-prevention/"&gt;Unitaid, Clinton Health Access Initiative, and Wits RHI&lt;/a&gt; — are doing their part to help generics reach the market faster. They’re backing two Indian generic manufacturers with funding and technical support to help scale production so that low-cost versions of the drug are available by 2027. If that works, it would cost just $40 per person per year — roughly what daily oral PrEP costs today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If that happens — that is &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; we’re able to make cheaper generics faster, roll them out equitably, and deliver them where people feel safe — lenacapavir could make a real dent in the HIV epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;Breakthrough science doesn’t guarantee a breakthrough in public health.

This quiet mineral helps you relax, sleep better, and manage stress. Yet, experts say most people don’t get enough of it through food or lifestyle habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The most overlooked mineral in modern life&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low magnesium is easy to miss because its symptoms overlap with everyday tiredness or stress. Despite being vital for more than 300 chemical reactions in the body, this mineral often goes unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-Consumer/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Institutes of Health (NIH)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, magnesium supports muscle and nerve function, blood pressure control, and energy production. Yet most people don’t get enough from their diet.

It also activates the part of your nervous system that helps you relax and sleep. When levels drop, people often report anxiety, muscle tension, or disturbed sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/6/1846" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;review published in Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and summarized by &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/should-you-take-magnesium-supplements" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Harvard Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; notes that magnesium deficiency can cause fatigue, headaches, and muscle cramps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also plays a role in heart health. Low levels have been linked to high blood pressure and arrhythmia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The modern lifestyle problem&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue is not lack of awareness. It is how we live. Diets high in processed food, chronic stress, and excess coffee or alcohol all deplete magnesium. Even sweating during workouts or living in polluted cities increases magnesium loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refined grains and packaged snacks, staples of urban diets, contain little magnesium because processing removes the nutrient-rich outer layer. Over time, this slow depletion adds up, especially for people with restrictive diets or gut issues like IBS or celiac disease that reduce absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Signs your magnesium may be low&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of magnesium deficiency appear slowly and are easy to miss. Common signs include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle cramps or twitching eyelids&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Restless sleep or frequent awakenings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue despite adequate rest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headaches or migraines&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tingling or numbness in hands and feet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unexplained anxiety or low mood&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these sound familiar, a blood test can help. However, magnesium levels in blood reflect only a small part of thebody’s total magnesium. Doctors usually consider symptoms and diet together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Magnesium and better sleep&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium helps the brain relax by binding to GABA receptors, the same neurotransmitters targeted by many sleep medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3703169/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;clinical study in the Journal of Research in Medical Sciences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that older adults who took magnesium supplements slept better, woke up less often, and had improved melatonin levels.

But supplements can help people with diabetes, digestive issues, or those taking diuretics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://main.icmr.nic.in/sites/default/files/nutrition/Nutrient_Requirements_Revised_2020.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; recommends about 340–360 mg daily for men and 310–320 mg for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you take supplements, magnesium citrate or glycinate are better absorbed than oxide forms.

&lt;p&gt;If your mood fluctuations feel less like your usual stress and anxiety and more like the beginnings of a villain origin story (and you’re also experiencing symptoms like insomnia and feeling warmer than usual), it could be the beginning stages of perimenopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what doctors call the transition to menopause, which is the end of a person’s reproductive years and technically marked by 12 consecutive months without a period, with the full transition taking anywhere from two to eight years, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/menopause/menopause-basics" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7956240" data-affiliate="true"&gt;according to the Office on Women’s Health&lt;/a&gt; (OWH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perimenopause usually begins after the age of 40 (though it can start earlier), the variabilities of which — both in ovarian function and hormone levels — can leave you feeling out of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s generally a confusing time that catches many of us by surprise, in large part because of how wildly unpredictable symptoms of perimenopause can be,” Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.annabarbieri-md.com" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7956240" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Anna Barbieri&lt;/a&gt;, New York-based OB-GYN and founding physician at &lt;a href="https://www.elektrahealth.com" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7956240" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Elektra Health&lt;/a&gt;, told HuffPost. “Hormonal changes, and the way symptoms show up, are anything but linear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some, periods can still be regular in the early stages of perimenopause, making it easy to brush off mood-related symptoms (anxiety, irritability, crying spells) as being caused by things like stress, sleep deprivation or burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But start adding signs of cognitive decline to the mix — drawing a blank as to what someone just told you, forgetting what you walked into a room to do — and these ongoing mental blips can trigger understandable waves of panic and fear as to what exactly is going on with that mind of yours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The possible links between perimenopause and mental health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our 20s and 30s (pre-menopause), there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.menopause.org/for-women/menopauseflashes/menopause-symptoms-and-treatments/going-mad-in-perimenopause-signs-and-solutions" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7956240" data-affiliate="true"&gt;predictable ebb and flow&lt;/a&gt; to our hormones — ditto post-menopause, a time when our hormones are low, but steady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perimenopausal period is marked by one long hormonal fluctuation, with levels of estrogen and progesterone (typically referred to as “female” hormones) varying quite a bit. Testosterone — a “male” hormone that’s produced at lower levels in people assigned female at birth — takes a slow dip as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: “Your hormones are a rollercoaster, and the rest of you is along for the ride,” Barbieri said.&lt;/p&gt;

Yeah, this one’s got that in spades. In a video posted by @pearl.the.golden.girl, big sis Pearl is lying on her side when her puppy sister Poppi toddles over and curls up right into her belly, like she was meant to fit there all along. The whole scene feels like a warm hug — calm, safe, and full of love and understanding. &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; Pearl seems to have a mountain of patience for her little sister, and Poppi’s every move screams that she trusts her older sister with her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Golden Retriever puppy cuddling big sister will melt anyone’s heart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The video has won several hearts online. The in-video text sets the tone: “Getting our dog a puppy so she never had to be lonely.” From there, it’s just pure comfort and sweetness. Little Poppi comes, sits, and lies down right in the crook of Pearl’s belly. She finds the coziest spot between Pearl’s front and hind legs before resting her head on her sister’s back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Pearl gets up at this, but then lies straight back down. She ensures that Poppi has enough space to stretch. In the next shot, Poppi rests her head against Pearl’s front leg. The puppy gets up for just a second and then puts her head down again, becoming as comfortable as possible. She sighs like she’s finally found home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The video ends with them curled up together, fast asleep and perfectly nestled against each other, like puzzle pieces that fit.

But as her due date neared, troubling symptoms crept in: sudden swelling, rapid weight gain and elevated blood pressure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day had started off perfectly. Family filled the Pearman home in Baltimore, Md., eager to meet &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shannelpearman" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Shannel Pearmen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Shannel Pearmen&lt;/a&gt; and her husband Jared’s newborn son — the first grandchild on both sides. There was food, laughter and the kind of joy that comes from gathering around a baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even as the house buzzed with happiness, Shannel was battling a nagging headache. She brushed it off as the exhaustion of new motherhood, assuming that by bedtime a little medicine would make it fade. Instead, the pain only grew worse. Her son’s cries kept her awake through the night — something that, looking back now, she says may have saved her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By morning, the headache had escalated. Without warning, Shannel was overcome by the urge to vomit. As she rushed to the bathroom, Jared followed close behind. When she looked up at him, half of his face had vanished from her vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that instant, she knew something was terribly wrong. Shannel called her mother, a nurse, who urged her to get to the hospital immediately. The couple grabbed their one-week-old baby, threw a few things into a bag and sped through the night to the emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was supposed to be one of the happiest times of my life,” Shannel, then 29, tells PEOPLE exclusively. “We had just had our first child. We were over the moon. But overnight, everything changed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannel Pearman&lt;/p&gt; Shannel Pearman and her husband Jared&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just weeks earlier, life had felt picture-perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was June 2019, and Shannel had built the life she always dreamed of: a thriving career as a TV reporter, a loving husband in Jared — a photographer she met while working at a station — and a home in Baltimore. The couple had been eagerly awaiting the arrival of their first child, a son due in May 2019, and for most of her pregnancy, everything went exactly as she hoped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was my first child. I was glowing and happy, just wanting to rub my belly and enjoy it,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as her due date neared, troubling symptoms crept in: sudden swelling, rapid weight gain and elevated blood pressure. Shannel voiced her concerns repeatedly, but says they were brushed aside. “Everyone kept telling me it was normal — that the swelling would go down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, her condition worsened. At 41 weeks, she was induced and labored for hours before doctors determined an emergency C-section was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because of the surgery, I couldn’t hold my son right away,” she recalls. “That was so emotional. I had just given birth, my son was here, but I couldn’t hold him yet. I just couldn’t wait to finally have him in my arms. When the moment finally came in the early hours of the morning, even though I was exhausted, it was one of the best feelings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannel Pearman&lt;/p&gt; Shannel Pearman and her husband Jared with their newborn son&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the troubling symptoms didn’t disappear. Shannel left the hospital with reassurances that everything was fine — that the swelling was normal and would resolve with time. She was told to come back in six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just one week later, on June 1, 2019, a splitting headache and blurred vision sent her racing back to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What followed was a blur. Doctors shuffled her between units — labor and delivery, then other departments — but never ordered a CT scan. Hours slipped by. It wasn’t until her mother arrived from Delaware and demanded answers that a scan was finally performed. That’s when they discovered the truth: Shannel was in the middle of a &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23969-hemorrhagic-stroke" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hemorrhagic stroke;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hemorrhagic stroke&lt;/a&gt;, caused by a ruptured blood vessel in her brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was disbelief,” she says. “I was 29 years old. I was healthy. I had no health issues. I had just been in the hospital. Everything seemed fine. We didn’t think anything seriously wrong was happening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannel Pearman&lt;/p&gt; Shannel Pearman in the hospital&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long after, Shannel lost consciousness. The last thing she remembers is sitting in the ER holding her newborn as medical teams tried to comfort her. From there, she was rushed into emergency brain surgery, during which doctors removed half of her skull to relieve the swelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her next clear memory is waking up in a different hospital. She remembers fumbling with her phone, trying to send texts until someone enlarged the font so she could read the words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The first few days felt like an out-of-body experience,” she says. “I had lost my left peripheral vision in both eyes. Waking up and not being able to see was emotional. But more than anything, I was just thankful to be alive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannel Pearman&lt;/p&gt; Shannel Pearman in the hospital after her stroke&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before her stroke, Shannel, now 35, had planned to breastfeed her son. It had taken a few days to find a rhythm with him — and just as she did, everything changed. But her family refused to let that dream slip away. While she was in the ICU, Jared taught himself how to use a breast pump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No one there knew how — I was the youngest patient on the floor — so my husband had to figure it out himself,” she says. Relatives pitched in, creating a relay system: pumping, cleaning parts and driving milk from the hospital to their baby so she could continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Something my family always noted is that no matter what I was going through, whenever I spoke, I was full of positivity,” she adds. “I was excited about what life could look like after I got through all of this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her optimism carried her, but recovery was grueling. Shannel spent less than a week in the hospital before she was discharged, but until her second surgery on July 25, she had to wear a protective helmet anytime she wasn’t sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hated that thing,” she admits. “It was so bulky and uncomfortable, and I had to wear it constantly. I’m thankful for its purpose — it protected my head — but I couldn’t wait to be rid of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When her helmet finally came off, it felt like freedom — yet the relief was paired with a sobering truth: nothing was going back to the way it was. She would not return to work, she could no longer drive and her vision would never fully come back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the help of occupational therapists and specialists, Shannel began to relearn how to navigate life. Still, at first, she didn’t fully understand what living with a brain injury would mean. Weeks — even months — passed before the reality truly set in. She had regained the ability to walk and talk, but invisible struggles remained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I struggle with processing, with crippling migraines, with reading and speaking sometimes,” Shannel explains. “There are moments when I can’t find the word I want or can’t get it out. And because the disabilities are invisible, it makes it even more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Essentially everything I do now is impacted by my brain injury,” she adds. “Something as simple as writing on paper takes extra effort. Everything has changed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannel Pearman&lt;/p&gt; Shannel Pearman wearing her helmet and holding her son&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back, Shannel says that rather than hide what she was going through, she made a different choice: to share it. Just days after leaving the hospital, she posted updates on Instagram — helmet on, baby in hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what began as personal updates for friends and family soon grew into something larger, as strangers connected with her honesty. Today, she uses that platform to raise awareness about maternal health, Black maternal health and stroke among young people — issues she admits she barely knew about before her ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her posts have since reached millions, including one video of her struggling to recall the color yellow. That clip alone has been &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shannelpearman/video/7536997510041193758" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:viewed more than 6.6 million times;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;viewed more than 6.6 million times&lt;/a&gt; and drawn over 16,000 comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When that one picked up traction, I was so surprised because honestly, I didn’t even want to post it,” she admits. “I share so much of my journey, but that moment felt too raw, too vulnerable. I thought it was embarrassing. But my husband captured it, and I thought, maybe I should share — because it’s one thing to hear me talk about the struggle, it’s another to actually see it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, she posted the clip and logged off, too nervous to check. When she finally returned, the response floored her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was taken aback that this video — the one I almost didn’t post — was getting millions of views,” she says with a laugh. “But then I started reading the comments, and it made me emotional."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On one hand, there was so much love and encouragement from strangers cheering me on," she adds. "And on the other hand, there were people who could relate. That broke my heart, but it also made me grateful. Because for them, seeing that video meant they weren’t alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, one of the hardest things she’s shared publicly has been her decision about whether to have another child. She and Jared had always dreamed of a bigger family, but after the stroke, the idea felt terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Part of me felt like the stroke had robbed me of so much,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took a year and a half of therapy, medical consultations and prayer before they were ready to even consider it. Ultimately, they made a plan — and when Shannel became pregnant again, joy came with new fears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her second pregnancy wasn’t easy. PTSD triggered anxiety and depression, but she carried on and eventually welcomed a daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our family is complete,” she says with a laugh. “We have our baby boy, our baby girl. Confidently, we are never having another child again — I cannot go through this again. Our family is complete, and it is perfect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannel Pearman&lt;/p&gt; Shannel Pearman and her husband Jared and kids&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, she says her focus is simple: “surviving the day.” Her symptoms remain unpredictable; stress, overstimulation or bright light can trigger severe migraines. She relies on Nurtec for relief, plus supplements and calming routines — coffee, hydration, slow mornings — to reduce risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, life with two little ones and a brain injury is anything but quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Where my brain needs peace and quiet, my kids give me everything but that,” she laughs. “I’m just trying to show up and be the best mom I can be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She’s even started talking to her son about her disability. “He’s six now, and that has been heartbreaking. The first conversation I had with him was explaining that I’m visually impaired, or ‘partially blind,’ as I say to him, and that’s why Mommy doesn’t drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had a suspicion he already knew, because sometimes he’d test me — like standing on my left side to see if I could see him," she adds. "When I finally sat him down, he could repeat back what I said, but I don’t think he fully understands. For my sixth stroke anniversary, we watched some of my videos together, and he recognizes when I’m in a hospital gown — he’ll say, ‘That’s a stroke video, Mommy had a stroke.’ But I don’t think he quite grasps what that means.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on her journey, Shannel’s voice softens and tears fill her eyes. “I hate that it has happened, and I hate that I’m disabled,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years after her stroke, the weight of her new reality hit hard. She wasn’t going back to work as a reporter. She couldn’t drive. Depression took hold, and dark days stretched on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But last year marked a turning point. She realized she could sit in bed all day and cry, but life wouldn’t wait. Her children were growing, and she had been given a second chance — a new opportunity she couldn’t waste. “I can’t just rot away — I don’t deserve that, my kids don’t deserve that, my husband doesn’t deserve that,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk: PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So she made a conscious choice to embrace the life she still had. “Yes, this sucks, but I’m going to live. I’ll take my kids to the Maryland State Fair, and maybe I’ll have a migraine afterward — but it’s okay. We’ll roll with the punches. Since making that shift, I’ve been able to truly be happy in this space. My old self would be proud of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her outlook has transformed. The struggles remain, but she’s focused on what truly matters: family, life, and creating memories. "Nothing else matters,” she says, a quiet certainty in her voice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/headache-nearly-cost-new-mom-29-her-life-exclusive-11812304" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 10:07:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE52TzhDcmFNcXF5aG1rbTVTZmVUUzVfS0Z6cU9NaDdDenlCVHFNZUZzYWJzaWFST2F3MUF0UHY4S0lyUmpYRUJQWGVXZnk4T2h2VWxIbWxyY0JCR3FUVU16YW1pV3ZXVncybE5OY2x0b01yXzVJQjVBU2JJd3ZrbzQ</guid></item><item><title>一氧化碳中毒的首个解毒剂，在几分钟内“净化”血液-好消息网络</title><link>https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/first-antidote-for-carbon-monoxide-poisoning-cleans-blood-in-minutes/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

BY-SA&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s invisible, it’s lethal, and it’s been with us for decades, but carbon monoxide poisoning can now be fought with the first-ever antidote that rapidly removes the toxic molecule from the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon monoxide or CO, poisoning accounts for 50,000 emergency room visits in the US each year and causes about 1,500 deaths, each one being lamented as a shameful waste and tragic oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the only treatments for CO poisoning are oxygen-based therapies, which help the body eliminate the toxic gas. However, even with treatment, nearly half of survivors suffer long-term heart and brain damage. This has created an urgent need for faster, more effective interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study &lt;a href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/news/2025/new-protein-therapy-shows-promise-as-first-ever-antidote-for-carbon-monoxide-poisoning.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; by University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) in &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2501389122" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;PNAS&lt;/a&gt;, the research team developed a new engineered protein-based therapy called RcoM-HBD-CCC, which acts like a sponge to soak up carbon monoxide from the blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RcoM (short for “regulator of metabolism”) is a natural protein isolated from the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Paraburkholderia xenovorans &lt;/em&gt;which uses it to sense minute levels of carbon monoxide in its environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers engineered a version that is highly selective, grabbing CO without interfering with oxygen or other important molecules in the bloodstream like nitric oxide, which is vital for the regulation of blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In tests on mice, the new therapy worked quickly to remove CO from red blood cells and was safely flushed out of the body through urine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CO is known commonly as the “silent killer,” because this odorless, invisible gas, typically released from combustion sources, including stovetops, propane heaters, car exhausts, and firewood, poisons in a gradual manner that isn’t immediately obvious to the victim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE FIRST AID ADVANCES: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Revolutionary Antidote Neutralizes Venom of 19 of World’s Deadliest Snakes–Thanks to Man Who Immunized Himself" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/revolutionary-new-antidote-neutralizes-venom-of-19-of-the-worlds-deadliest-snakes/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Revolutionary Antidote Neutralizes Venom of 19 of World’s Deadliest Snakes–Thanks to Man Who Immunized Himself&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In healthy bodies, oxygen inhaled from the air binds to the protein hemoglobin on the surface of red blood cells, which then ferry the oxygen to all the tissues of the body. CO however, competes with oxygen for hemoglobin. It enters the bloodstream and binds to hemoglobin with a 200 to 400-fold greater affinity than oxygen. That means CO hogs most of the hemoglobin seats, so not enough oxygen molecules can get a ride to the tissues that need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the only available treatments for carbon monoxide poisoning involve giving 100% pure oxygen, sometimes under pressure in a hyperbaric chamber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All too often, patients are not transported, diagnosed, and treated in time to reverse the effects of CO poisoning, which can cause lasting cardiac and neurological injuries or even death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE HOUSEHOLD TOXINS DEFEATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Flint Finishes Replacing 11,000 Lead Pipes, Concluding Activists’ Decade-Long Effort to Secure Clean Water" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/flint-finishes-replacing-11000-lead-pipes-concluding-activists-decade-long-effort-to-secure-clean-water/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Flint Finishes Replacing 11,000 Lead Pipes, Concluding Activists’ Decade-Long Effort to Secure Clean Water&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infused in the bloodstream, scavenger hemoproteins like RcoM-HBD-CCC rapidly bind to carbon monoxide molecules, reducing the time it takes to clear half of the carbon monoxide in the blood to less than a minute, compared to more than hour with pure oxygen therapy and five hours without any treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A potential drawback the researchers were aware of is that so-called “scavengers” like RcoM also have an affinity for oxygen, and so may uptake the nitric oxide mentioned earlier. This can cause wild and potentially unsafe changes in blood pressure, but RcoM-HBD-CCC caused no such side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unlike other protein-based treatments, we found the compound caused only minimal changes in blood pressure, which was an exciting finding and raised the potential for this new molecule to have clinical applications,” said study corresponding author Mark T. Gladwin, MD, Dean of UMSOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This has the potential to become a rapid, intravenous antidote for carbon monoxide that could be given in the emergency department or even in the field by first-responders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future studies will likely include more pre-clinical research to determine the safe and effective dosage range for RcoM-HBD-CCC in treating carbon monoxide poisoning. It could also form the basis for new research in other fields, including as an oxygen delivery therapy or blood substitute. This could include hemorrhagic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe anemias, and the preservation of organs for transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;

I had a negative colonoscopy in 2003, but in 2013, my colonoscopy required a polypectomy of a 3-mm tubular adenoma. In 2019, my colonoscopy was negative again. I'm concerned with the risks involved in repeat colonoscopies. What is your opinion?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— J.G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear J.G.:&lt;/strong&gt; The usual recommendation would be to consider a repeat colonoscopy in 2029, when you would be about 82. This is an age where you could decide to stop having colonoscopies, but if you were my patient, I would probably advise you to consider another colonoscopy again, given your history of a tubular adenoma. This is a condition that can progress to colon cancer over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;You are right that there are risks of a colonoscopy, but high blood pressure and a valve replacement are not high-risk conditions that would make a colonoscopy too dangerous, in my opinion. If the next colonoscopy were negative again, you could then safely discontinue the colonoscopies as the risk of progressing to colon cancer in your expected lifetime, even if you lived to be over 100, would be very small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I would respect your decision not to have any more colonoscopies, but in my opinion, the benefit outweighs the risk for most healthy 82-year-olds with a history of premalignant polyps, even if your most recent one didn't show any polyps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; What is a fever? I mean, when I should worry about my temperature? I usually run slightly below normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— A.O.A.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear A.O.A.:&lt;/strong&gt; Although 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 degrees Fahrenheit) is usually considered a fever, this isn't universally true. Body temperature varies based on the time of day (morning temperatures are lower than afternoon), by age (older people tend to have lower temps), and from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;An increase in a baseline temperature of 1-2 degrees Celsius (1.8-3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) could be considered a fever. The "average" person's temperature has been found to be between 36.6-36.8 degrees Celsius (97.9-98.2 degrees Fahrenheit) in large trials, so most people are below what has long been considered "normal." The range of healthy people's temperatures is quite broad, with 99% of people who were studied ranging from 35.3-37.7 degrees Celsius (95.5-99.9 degrees Fahrenheit).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Elevated temperatures often come from infections. Viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic infections can all cause a fever. However, there are metabolic conditions that cause an elevated blood temperature without an infection. Heat stroke, some medications, very high thyroid hormone levels, and bleeding inside the brain can all cause high temperatures, sometimes dangerously high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If a person has a low-grade fever (typically 37.5 degrees Celsius/99.5 degrees Fahrenheit, or 38 degrees Celsius/100.4 degrees Fahrenheit) along with the typical symptoms of a cold, this is not necessarily a sign to worry. The fever can be treated with acetaminophen (Tylenol). Higher fevers may be worth a phone call or a visit with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Finally, a person can have a very severe infection without a fever, so you can't count on it 100%. Older people are less likely to be able to mount a fever response, so signs of a serious illness (for example, cough and confusion, which often represents pneumonia in an older person) may require urgent or emergent medical evaluation even without a fever.&lt;em&gt; Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 09:14:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1AFBVV95cUxOSlRIX1NETEVlcDI5VV9CNGc2RlJUdXlKR0U0RnhTeElubkdpSlQzR1Z1VFRHUVNtbFI3VW5lYkdnSTI4ZDlodmtteHpKdzdtZ1FwWVFHTjM5b2Z4YlV1V212UjdXWTdQTHZFV0UzSzBibTM3WnI1bkVCM0plajNtbVp6SnZ3a2xPcXlZbWY4TlNINEpuYlU1V3ZvSnY4ZVpoLVNUNnFINHRubUs4YmNxdEhORFN5TW5mRmoyZVNXQzZKZzVZUjhOZTlTYm04WERxdU8xOQ</guid></item><item><title>引体向上、穴居人节食和生物黑客：探索MAHA人的心态-雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/article/pull-ups-caveman-diets-and-biohacking-inside-the-maha-man-mindset-090000223.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.instagram.com/clintfuqua/?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clint Fuqua;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Clint Fuqua&lt;/a&gt; was MAHA before MAHA. In fact, the 48-year-old personal trainer and gym owner says he was one of the first people to hashtag “make America healthy” (his was #MAH; the “again” hadn’t come along yet) in 2010. Fuqua had then gone through a bit of a “reinvention” himself and decided to dedicate his life to helping others with what he calls “personal health care reform,” he tells Yahoo. “The goal was: How do we get people healthy, for real? It comes down to people taking control of their lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So, when Robert F. Kennedy Jr. came onto the scene in 2024 with his plan to “Make America healthy again,” Fuqua was naturally on board. The principles he’s now hearing from the Trump administration align with his ethos: “I’m gonna take care of myself, and I’m not gonna rely on somebody else to take care of me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“&lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/maha-moms-theyre-feeling-heard-174847929.html" data-ylk="slk:MAHA moms;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;MAHA moms&lt;/a&gt;” have made headlines advocating for RFK Jr.’s plans on behalf of their children’s health, whether through &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/form-environmentalism-called-america-healthy-145703823.html" data-ylk="slk:better food;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;better food&lt;/a&gt; or “&lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/cdc-approves-limited-recommendation-covid-155432529.html" data-ylk="slk:informed consent;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;informed consent&lt;/a&gt;” vaccine regulations. But what about the MAHA &lt;em&gt;men&lt;/em&gt;? We went looking for what the movement means to these guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="what-is-maha-to-men"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is MAHA to men?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For Fuqua, MAHA means “taking better care of yourself: Eat what you’re supposed to eat, do what you’re supposed to do, exercise daily ... set yourself up to live a good life and take care of people,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That sense of autonomy, of taking your fate into your hands rather than trying to “shove it back on a doctor or family member,” as Fuqua puts it, is a big part of MAHA’s appeal to men like him. There’s plenty of overlap between what MAHA moms and MAHA men want, but this self-determination is especially compelling to the males of the group, says &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.unbiasedscience.com/about-us" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jess Steier;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Jess Steier&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Unbiased Science. The MAHA movement offers “a sense of control: If you do this or don’t do this, you will live longer and you will have a better life,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Of course, wanting autonomy is nothing new. But when COVID-19 hit the U.S., that desire was put into a pressure cooker. Amid lockdowns and ever-changing public health guidance, many Americans, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/covid-pushed-generation-young-people-120000108.html" data-ylk="slk:particularly young ones;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;particularly young ones&lt;/a&gt; and especially&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;young men, felt like “guinea pigs in this trial period of restrictions,” &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.theupandup.us/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rachel Janfaza;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Rachel Janfaza&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the Up and Up, a qualitative research firm that studies Gen Z, tells Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the listening sessions Janfaza hosts across the country, Gen Z men have pointed out the frustrating contradictions they saw during the pandemic. One said he was told he could go to wrestling practice but had to wear a mask, for example. “That didn’t make sense to him when he was literally on top of people,” says Janfaza. That period of sometimes confusing restrictions “set the tone for the rest of their lives,” she says. “Young people, and men in particular, are looking for that control and sense of autonomy in many walks of life,” including their health, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Between the pandemic and headlines about the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/colorectal-cancer-rates-rising-among-120043959.html" data-ylk="slk:rising rates of cancer;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;rising rates of cancer&lt;/a&gt;, chronic illness and obesity among young adults, Gen Z-ers may “feel like something is broken, and they want to take it into their own hands,” and that may particularly be the case for men, Janfaza says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="masculinity-and-maha"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Masculinity and MAHA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Health Secretary Kennedy has posted some instantly &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/rfk-jr-doing-shirtless-pushups-080301806.html" data-ylk="slk:viral videos of himself doing push-ups and exercising;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;viral videos of himself doing push-ups and exercising&lt;/a&gt; — shirtless and in jeans. In one of those videos, he said he was “&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/rfk-jr-shares-bizarre-shirtless-212458680.html" data-ylk="slk:practicing” for his then upcoming confirmation hearing;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;practicing” for his then upcoming confirmation hearing&lt;/a&gt;. While health experts aren’t sure how these displays demonstrated his fitness for the role, they did show that he was physically fit, especially for a then 70-year-old man. And that matters to the men of MAHA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There’s a real physicality” to a MAHA man, &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1" class="link " href="https://history.stanford.edu/people/kathryn-olivarius" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kathryn Olivarius;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Kathryn Olivarius&lt;/a&gt;, a Stanford University science historian who’s working on a book about the MAHA movement, tells Yahoo. And that physicality — big muscles, a chiseled jawline, a tanned physique — “is tied to a return to a masculinity that feels very situated in the past,” Olivarius adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For many men who support the movement, MAHA is synonymous with this kind of masculinity. “Men are protectors and builders,” says Fuqua. “You’ve gotta be able-bodied to build stuff and to be able to protect what you love.” In particular, the goal is for “men to get back to being men,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The MAHA men — and Kennedy’s videos — also closely resemble the countless male influencer (man-fluencer) videos that populate social media. A recent Common Sense Media report found that three-quarters of adolescent boys in the U.S. &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/article/masculinity-maxxing-and-the-manosphere-are-big-online-how-thats-affecting-boys-in-4-charts-090003230.html" data-ylk="slk:regularly encounter masculinity content online;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;regularly encounter masculinity content online&lt;/a&gt;. “People are seeking to ‘reclaim’ something that society has lost,” says Olivarius. And that desire is “amped up by our online culture,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="looking-back-on-healthier-times"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking back on ‘healthier’ times&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Like their female counterparts, many MAHA men look to the past for solutions to problems they see in the current food, health care and wellness landscape. A MAHA man is the “cave person” to the trad-wife woman, says Steier. Some male influencers take this as far as promoting &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/raw-milk-beef-tallow-diy-sunscreen-and-more-health-and-beauty-trends-have-roots-in-farm-life-is-barnyard-wellness-safe-110037861.html" data-ylk="slk:beef tallow;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;beef tallow&lt;/a&gt;, carnivore or &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:14;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thecavemandad/video/7502920304704900395?q=caveman%20diet&amp;amp;t=1760369057167" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:caveman diets;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:14;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;caveman diets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:15;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.tiktok.com/@the_captains_lifestyle/video/7553053270764424461" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:eschewing sunscreen altogether;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:15;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;eschewing sunscreen altogether&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, 64% of men who responded to a Yahoo/YouGov survey of 1,690 U.S. adults said they rarely or never wear sunscreen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This skepticism of modern products and medicine runs deep. Fuqua believes there’s a lot of “trash” on the sunscreen market, so he sticks to versions that use &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/article/sunscreen-expire-protect-skin-tips-choosing-sunscreens-100048337.html" data-ylk="slk:natural minerals like zinc instead of chemical sunblocks;cpos:16;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;natural minerals like zinc instead of chemical sunblocks&lt;/a&gt;. But he also believes that &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/few-minutes-sun-sunscreen-protective-090007902.html" data-ylk="slk:sun is important to health;cpos:17;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;sun is important to health&lt;/a&gt; (it is, to a point) and suggests that &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/gen-z-adults-unaware-sunburn-risks-tanning-myths-204506852.html" data-ylk="slk:skin cancer;cpos:18;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;skin cancer&lt;/a&gt; is a problem of modern behavior. People are “big overgrown plants with emotional issues: We need water, food, sunlight and some emotional support,” he says. “Was skin cancer as big of an issue [in the past]? No, because people got out of the sun as much as they could or wore coverage; they weren’t out there in a thong doing gardening.” (Skin cancer has existed for many years, but Fuqua is right that covering up and staying in the shade are also effective &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:19;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-prevention/sun-protection/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:forms of sun protection;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:19;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;forms of sun protection&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Similarly, Fuqua sees modern food as the result of “frankenscience.” So, he gets his eggs directly from a local farm. It’s too inconvenient to get in Dallas, where Fuqua now lives, but he grew up drinking &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/raw-milk-has-always-been-risky-to-drink-then-it-tested-positive-for-bird-flu-now-all-milk-will-be-tested-for-the-virus-154348258.html" data-ylk="slk:raw milk;cpos:20;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;raw milk&lt;/a&gt; from his aunt and uncle’s cows (“there’s nothing better”), and is among the 40% of men who think it should be &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:21;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/php/publications/unpasteurized-cow-milk.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fully legal across the U.S.;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:21;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;fully legal across the U.S.&lt;/a&gt;, according to Yahoo/YouGov polling. And while he’s not wholly against vaccination, Fuqua doesn’t think shots and their schedules should be one-size-fits-all for kids. He cites his mother, who was a teacher who questioned vaccines and blended up baby food for him rather than ever buying formula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fuqua’s beliefs illustrate a central tension public health experts see in the MAHA movement: “There are kernels of truth buried in some places,” says Steier.

Alternative vaccination schedules are better than no vaccines at all, but there’s no proven danger in kids getting more than one at a time — and &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:24;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/vaccines-and-nervous-parents-why-spacing-out-the-vaccine-schedule-is-not-the-answer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:there is a risk of infection if vaccination is delayed.;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:24;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;there is a risk of infection if vaccination is delayed.&lt;/a&gt; And &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:25;pos:1" class="link " href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/mineral-vs-chemical-sunscreen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:physical sunscreens like zinc work well, but chemical ones are also effective and perfectly safe;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:25;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;physical sunscreens like zinc work well, but chemical ones are also effective and perfectly safe&lt;/a&gt;. The movement is characterized by “this very binary way of thinking, and that to me is the most dangerous part of MAHA,” Steier says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="the-tech-nostalgia-paradox-of-maha-men"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The tech-nostalgia paradox of MAHA men&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even as Fuqua looks back to the past for guidance about what is healthiest now, he also places hope in certain technologies. He would like to see genetic testing used to help determine which kids get which vaccinations and when. Fuqua also believes that at-home testing and annual &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/article/i-tried-four-trendy-body-scans-the-results-were--confusing-100056673.html" data-ylk="slk:full-body scans;cpos:26;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;full-body scans&lt;/a&gt; should become routine. This combination of retrograde and futurist beliefs is a theme among the men of MAHA in particular, according to experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The distinction between good and bad tech seems to lie, for MAHA men, in the difference between corporatized and institutionalized products (vaccines, Big Food) and ones marketed as personalized (supplements, at-home blood tests). “MAHA is presented as being about asserting agency and control, and there’s a tech component that [makes you feel] like you’re optimizing your own body and own self,” says Olivarius. Everything from high-protein diets to wearable trackers falls under “biohacking, in a way that makes you feel like an active participant in a kind of gamified [approach to health],” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Experts say this is fine — to a point. “You want to get healthy and fit, and you’re going to biohack and run and lift weights? That’s great if you want to do that and it makes you happy,” says Olivarius. “What scares me is, [if] you start to slip into the anti-vaccine territory, then it becomes less about lifestyle and more about a worldview,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="the-good-the-bad-and-the-hopeful-for-maha-men"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The good, the bad and the hopeful for MAHA men&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many of the practices that Fuqua and men like him incorporate into their own lives are good for health and well-being. It’s also apparent that Fuqua is acting in good faith; he genuinely cares about the student-athletes and clients he trains. But this is exactly what presents a problem for scientists. When it comes to public health, it’s dangerous to take the bad with the good. It’s the job of scientists to think and communicate in relative risks — to talk about nuance and why any given behavior won’t guarantee better health. But that messaging just isn’t as direct and satisfying as MAHA’s — and because basic healthy behaviors have become wrapped up in political identity, it’s difficult for science communicators to support some MAHA beliefs while countering others without alienating those involved. “Public health needs better PR,” says Steier. “But we can’t get it because by definition science is all about the nuance; we’re never proving anything, we’re accumulating evidence — that’s a mouthful, and people don’t want a mouthful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Rather than fight or disagree with the MAHA men, Steier thinks the way forward is through “empowering” them. “All right, men, you’re smart enough to see through the grift” of the marketing of ultra-processed foods, for example, she says. But Steier points out that &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:27;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-05/global-wellness-industry-is-now-worth-6-3-trillion#:~:text=The%20global%20wellness%20industry%20was,Institute%2C%20a%20leading%20industry%20group." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:wellness is now a bigger industry;cpos:27;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;wellness is now a bigger industry&lt;/a&gt; than &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:28;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/us-pharmaceuticals-market-report#:~:text=How%20big%20is%20the%20U.S.,USD%20669.42%20million%20in%202025." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Big Pharma;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:28;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Big Pharma&lt;/a&gt;, but with none of the regulation. So perhaps MAHA men can turn that same skepticism on supplements or vaccine misinformation. “There are some red flags here, but you’re in the driver’s seat, you can make the best decision — just know there are people who are taking advantage of you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxQZnQ3dWxBQi0tUXZxaFFGWVZhc2cxWW5Fb2hBQUE5QjhoRVVDYkVfVzJoaF9oYmJKZ19iOUttYVRzOHVUQWVlczRNRVYtbzhGQ1BjcThQSHpFdlRWb0lNTlhHWFVGZWRyRUlKRW1OTEExZDUybFhHWEt1U0lySU93eU9Cb3o3MnVxNUF2YVFsQ1RWSzg0ZlBKLUFTWV9tMlVveFRtMWNlQlhYdW5MdDgzQ2l6MGNxd1BMTEFOaw</guid></item><item><title>儿科医生在疫苗疑虑时期如何赢得信任-调度</title><link>https://thedispatch.com/article/pediatricians-vaccine-refusal/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section id="article-body" class="tight-template" :class="{'text-size-sm': $store.ui.textSize === 'sm', 'text-size-md': $store.ui.textSize === 'md', 'text-size-lg': $store.ui.textSize === 'lg', 'text-size-xl': $store.ui.textSize === 'xl'}"&gt;
    &lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Andrew Miller knew something was up. The North Carolina pediatrician saw nearly a dozen new patients at his practice over the span of a couple of weeks last year, all of whom were opting out of their children receiving some or all vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the pattern became clear, Miller, a board-certified physician who supports the vaccine schedule, eventually asked a patient how they found his practice. “Well, you know, you’re on that website,” the patient told him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;    


&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website, it turned out, is “Dr. Green Mom,” a blog with an affiliated supplements company run by Ashley Mayer. Mayer is a &lt;a href="https://hpa.unc.edu/explore/explore-health-careers/naturopathic-medicine/"&gt;naturopathic doctor&lt;/a&gt; who describes herself as “vaccine-neutral” and who sells her own &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/dr-green-mom-llc-644546-01302023"&gt;supplements&lt;/a&gt;, including products like “VaxClear” that she claims helps with “toxin elimination” during vaccination. She also maintains a database of doctors in each state who are friendly towards or tolerant of families who forgo some or even all vaccines—and Miller is on that list.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I agree very little with what is on the Dr. Green Mom site, and I think it mostly operates in a pseudoscience fashion,” Miller told &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt;. But he also wants parents turning to sources like Dr. Green Mom to be exposed to sound medical science and understand the safety and necessity of vaccination. Miller welcomes patients who refuse some or even all vaccines into his practice, a position at odds with a growing number of pediatric practices across the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distrust of vaccines and immunization guidance had been on the rise since before the COVID pandemic, and childhood vaccination rates had been slipping for years. But the pandemic worsened these trends. President Donald Trump’s elevation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the health and human services secretary exacerbated existing political polarization around vaccines and emboldened purveyors of false and misleading medical information, fueling an even more chaotic information environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For primary care physicians and pediatricians, dealing with parents who don’t believe in most or all childhood vaccines, are skeptical of some immunizations, or are just plain confused has become a much more challenging task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some pediatric offices have adopted policies of dropping current patients or not accepting new families if they refuse to vaccinate their children. A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2770611"&gt;2019 survey&lt;/a&gt; of U.S. pediatric offices published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of American Medicine&lt;/em&gt; (JAMA) found that 51 percent of pediatricians reported that their offices had a policy requiring the dismissal of patients refusing vaccines, although only 37 percent of pediatricians reported often or always dropping such patients. Private practices were far more likely to have dismissal policies than hospitals or community health centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear just how widespread the practice of dropping patients who refuse vaccinations is since there's a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7227633/#CIT0009"&gt;dearth&lt;/a&gt; of studies on the topic. The 2019 survey is one of just a handful on the subject in the last two decades. Still, the literature shows an increasing trend. A 2012 survey using the same methodology as the 2019 version found only &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/136/6/1103/33879/Characteristics-of-Physicians-Who-Dismiss-Families?redirectedFrom=fulltext#:~:text=21%25%20of%20Peds%20and%204%25%20of%20FPs%20reported%20always/often%20dismissing%20families%20if%20they%20refused%20%E2%89%A51%20vaccine"&gt;21 percent&lt;/a&gt; of pediatricians dismissed families for vaccine refusal. “I think the prevalence of these policies has gone up, I don’t know by how much, though,” Sean O’Leary—a pediatric-infectious disease doctor and researcher at the University of Colorado who co-authored both surveys—told &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt;, noting that the 2019 survey has not been updated.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proliferation of dismissal policies is one factor driving vaccine skeptical parents to sites like Dr. Green Mom. After Miller found out he was on the site’s list as a doctor willing to treat the children of vaccine-skeptical parents, he decided against trying to have his name removed. Today, the vast majority of his new patients are undervaccinated or nonvaccinated, many of them arriving at his practice by way of the list but also from moms’ Facebook groups and word of mouth. Approximately two dozen of these patients commute more than an hour to Miller’s Durham, North Carolina, practice, he said; some drive up to four hours just to see him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pediatric clinic is affiliated with Duke Health, a private, nonprofit health care system that strongly encourages full vaccination but does not allow patient dismissals based on vaccination status. “That physician-patient relationship is an incredibly important one, and while there are things that could terminate that, they’re very few and far between,” said Miller, who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; in his personal capacity, not as a representative of his practice or Duke. “My job is to be there for the patient, even if they don’t really listen to me and do everything that I say.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The influx has included some of Miller’s new favorite patients. “They’re thoughtful, intelligent people. Many of them actually end up getting vaccines, either some or all, but they’re just looking for someone who is willing to have those conversations and dive in deep with them and treat them as someone capable of handling and thinking through that information,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When discussing vaccination, Miller said, he sets boundaries with new patients. He tells parents that there are black-and-white situations when a patient’s life could be at extreme risk by refusal of a vaccine, and in those cases, he will insist on certain actions. For example, if a mother has Hepatitis B or is unsure whether she has the disease or is untested, he’s adamant that children receive the Hep B vaccine immediately. But if both parents have been tested, and there’s no additional risk factors like drug use in the home, then for Miller, opting out of the vaccine is within the purview of parental choice. “I feel my job as the clinician is not to coerce, it’s not to belittle or shame,” he said. “My job is to educate and to explain.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The number of clinics who are willing to engage and see this population is dwindling.

                                            &lt;/cite&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Anna Ruderman, one of Miller’s colleagues who shared her personal views with &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt;, agrees that patients should not be dismissed for vaccine refusals. She believes that parents should be treated with compassion and will discuss with parents the risks of foregoing or spreading out specific vaccines. But she said decisions to depart from the vaccine schedule can be fraught, sometimes leading parents to misevaluate the importance of the guidelines. “It’s so hard because you run into this slippery slope of,  ‘Oh, well, they said this one wasn’t important,’ but they’re all important,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “Vaccines are by far the safest things we do as a pediatrician,” she added. “If we did no other parts of our job and just did the vaccines, that would save more lives than anything else that we do.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruderman has experienced more and more families declining vaccines, many based on false and misleading information. “I spent an extra hour with a patient today in my busy clinic schedule, discussing all of the misinformation and all of the fear that the parent felt, and going through all of the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/trump-expected-link-autism-with-tylenol-experts-say-more-research-needed-2025-09-22/"&gt;false information&lt;/a&gt; like Tylenol or vaccines cause autism,” she said, noting the parent was getting her information from TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller fears the growth of dismissal policies will drive more families toward bad information and medical advice. “The number of clinics who are willing to engage and see this population is dwindling,” he said. “These people are going to end up in these echo-chamber clinics that are telling them what they already want to hear, which I would argue is bad medicine. We really need to keep people within our clinics and keep it so that they can continue to be exposed to the good and healthy ideas, even if that makes it more challenging for us.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many pediatricians take a different approach. The reasons for dismissal policies can vary. Some practices worry about the legal liability of not vaccinating children who later contract vaccine-preventable diseases, although many offices require parents to sign a vaccine refusal form designed to mitigate liability risk. Other providers are concerned about the time involved in working with and persuading parents of non-vaccinated patients, reducing available time for others in practices that are often already booked out months in advance for new patients. (Pediatrics is one of the specialties that’s been &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/27/pediatrics-residency-match-pay-pediatrician-shortage/"&gt;hit hard&lt;/a&gt; by the national shortage of doctors.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the primary driver of dismissal policies seems to be a desire to incentivize higher vaccination rates and to protect people in clinics from potential increased risk of exposure to disease. Indeed, outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease have triggered the adoption of dismissal policies by many medical practices. O’Leary, the pediatrics researcher, said he noticed an uptick after the 2014-15 Disneyland measles outbreak that sickened more than 100 kids in California and even spread to Canada, sparking an outbreak of 150 more cases.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the&lt;em&gt; Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-03-27/should-doctors-kick-out-unvaccinated-children-pediatricians-face-dilemma#:~:text=Orange%20County%20pediatrician,young%20or%20immunocompromised."&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, a California pediatric clinic near the epicenter of the outbreak had allowed parents of patients to refuse vaccines. Doctors in the practice felt responsible for the spread of the disease among patients who choose to not receive the measles vaccine, putting at risk not only that cohort but also other patients who were immunocompromised, or too young to be vaccinated. “We had extremely low vaccination rates, and frankly, I think, a lot of our physicians and our patients became complacent; they weren’t seeing these diseases,” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/rzGcEhQXAV0"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Dr. Eric Ball, a partner at the practice. “And then we started having kids with measles come into our office.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We had babies and other people exposed in our waiting room to children who had measles. We had adults contract measles in our office. This was a huge wake-up call for all of us,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak resulted in pro-vaccine parents pressuring some pediatricians to put dismissal policies in place. “For some of the practices, they may have been on the fence about whether or not to have a policy like this, but then they started hearing it from parents in their practice, saying, ‘We like you guys and all, but we don’t want to bring our kids where they might pick up measles, so we’re going to go to the practice down the street that doesn’t accept non-vaccinators,’” O’Leary said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropping patients for refusing vaccines used to be a rarity and was actively discouraged by medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). In 2005, AAP issued &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7227633/#CIT0032:~:text=In%202005%2C%20the%20AAP%20recommended%20that%20%E2%80%9Cpediatricians%20should%20avoid%20discharging%20patients%20from%20their%20practice%20solely%20because%20a%20parent%20refuses%20to%20immunize%20his%20or%20her%20child.%E2%80%9D32"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt; that “pediatricians should avoid discharging patients from their practice solely because a parent refuses to immunize his or her child.” In 2013, the guidance was changed from “should avoid discharging” to “should endeavor not to discharge.” But &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/138/3/e20162146/52702/Countering-Vaccine-Hesitancy"&gt;in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, the group softly endorsed the practice, writing that “a pediatrician may consider dismissal of families who refuse vaccination as an acceptable option” but emphasizing that such move “is not one that should be made lightly, nor should it be made without considering and respecting the reasons for the parents’ point of view.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pediatric practices in North Carolina have also &lt;a href="https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2019/05/07/no-shots-no-service-pediatricians-take-tough-stands-while-vaccination-rates-for-young-children-in-n-c-drop/"&gt;tightened&lt;/a&gt; their policies in recent years, following outbreaks and increased cases of vaccine-preventable diseases like whooping cough. Several clinics reported the crackdown resulted in more parents choosing to vaccinate. But beyond anecdotes, there’s little evidence on whether dismissal policies result in higher aggregate vaccination rates beyond a particular practice. O’Leary said that pediatricians he talks to often think their practices’ policies result in more vaccination, but “we don’t have data on that.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He thinks ousting patients for vaccine refusal could, in practice, do more harm than good, citing the unknowns of where such patients will turn to for care next and how dismissal affects families’ trust in the medical system. While vaccination rates are slipping in some areas, they are &lt;a href="https://thedispatch.com/article/vaccines-back-to-school-rfk-oster/"&gt;still high&lt;/a&gt; nationally, and O’Leary &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMclde2407983"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that aside from areas experiencing an active outbreak, there’s no evidence that seeing unvaccinated patients increases the likelihood of the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases within a practice. It’s possible that the proliferation of dismissal policies could actually increase the risk of spreading disease if more non-vaccinated and under-vaccinated patients begin to cluster at a narrowing number of clinics that agree to see them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As vaccines become a more divisive and politically polarized topic, some pediatricians argue that the specter of dismissal is more likely to drive families away than incentivize them to vaccinate their children. If under-vaccination before the pandemic was more a product of complacency, a new policy could serve as a helpful nudge to parents and signal how important their doctors think immunization should be. But if under-vaccination is now more the result of confusion or fear, dismissal policies can simply seem coercive. “At one point it may have been an incentive, but I don’t know that it still is,” Ruderman said.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least some local health officials are actively encouraging physicians to turn away from dismissal policies. In Michigan’s Oakland County, the health department had previously encouraged clinics to adopt dismissal policies, but officials &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X24008089?fr=RR-2&amp;amp;ref=pdf_download&amp;amp;rr=98e1e7ce5f1631cb"&gt;changed course&lt;/a&gt; after they became concerned the approach was actually harming vaccine uptake. The county has since embraced a “harm reduction” approach designed to help educate clinicians on vaccine hesitancy and strategies to improve vaccine coverage aside from zero-tolerance dismissal policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pressure on pediatricians will continue to increase as misinformation and confusion around immunizations spread and red and blue states pursue diverging vaccine policies. While trust in public health authorities around vaccines has plummeted, pediatricians remain the only source of vaccine information trusted by large majorities across political affiliations: A &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/10/10/pediatricians-vaccine-trust-influencers-rfk-jr/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;-KFF poll&lt;/a&gt; released last week found that 85 percent of all parents trust their pediatricians’ advice on shots, including 93 percent of Democrats and 85 percent of Republicans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poll also found that only 12 percent of U.S. parents who trust their pediatrician skipped or delayed a vaccine, other than for COVID or the flu, but that number jumps to 41 percent among parents who distrust their pediatricians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2024, AAP released &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/153/3/e2023065483/196695/Strategies-for-Improving-Vaccine-Communication-and"&gt;additional guidance&lt;/a&gt; that O’Leary co-authored on vaccine dismissals. The update still says patient dismissal for refusing vaccines is an acceptable option for medical practitioners, but places even more emphasis on treating dismissal as a last resort “after repeated attempts to help understand and address parental values and vaccine concerns, engender trust, and strengthen the therapeutic alliance” and after “less drastic alternatives” are considered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Miller, building trust with patients is incompatible with the pressure of a dismissal policy. “[If] we say, ‘Do this or else,’ maybe they do choose to get one more vaccine that day in that clinical encounter,” Miller said. “But what I’ve done is further undercut the trust and the relationship that I had with them before, and I’m ultimately losing them in the long run, from becoming a part of what I think is the good practice of medicine for vaccinations.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

            

&lt;p&gt;Alcohol is a leading cause of cancer across Europe, and experts say stronger government policies to curb drinking could prevent thousands of cancer cases and deaths each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the European Union alone, the subregion with the &lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/04/05/dry-january-where-in-europe-is-drinking-alcohol-getting-worse-and-which-countries-have-cut"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;heaviest alcohol consumption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the world, alcohol caused more than 111,000 new cancer cases in 2020, according to the new scientific review from the World Health Organization's (WHO) cancer research agency, known as the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).&lt;/p&gt;        

&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, that number reached an estimated 741,000 cases, with men accounting for almost 70 per cent of new cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the health consequences, the economic toll is also substantial: according to WHO, premature deaths from alcohol-related cancers cost €4.58 billion in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The WHO European Region, and especially countries of the EU, are paying too high a price for alcohol in preventable cancers and broken families, as well as costing billions to taxpayers,” said Dr Gundo Weiler, who leads prevention and health promotion efforts at WHO's Europe office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some call alcohol a ‘cultural heritage’, but disease, death, and disability should not be normalised as part of European culture," he added.&lt;/p&gt;  

&lt;h2&gt;How alcohol is linked to cancer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IARC first classified alcohol as carcinogenic in 1988. It says alcohol raises the risk of at least seven types of cancer, including cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, liver, colorectum, and female breast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe alcohol causes cancer through multiple mechanisms, including altered hormone levels, changes to the gut microbiome, and DNA damage from oxidative stress and the metabolite acetaldehyde, which is found in ethanol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reducing or quitting alcohol lowers the risk of developing these cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
  

&lt;p&gt;Most alcohol-attributable cancers are linked to “risky” drinking (two to six alcoholic drinks per day) and “heavy” drinking (more than six drinks per day), according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, even “moderate” drinking (fewer than two drinks per day) was responsible for more than 100,000 new cancer cases globally in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Strategies to reduce risks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new analysis marked the first time IARC has evaluated the potential benefits of alcohol-related cancer prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It "establishes with no further doubt that population-wide alcohol policies reduce drinking, and that reduced drinking lowers cancer risk," said IARC director Dr Elisabete Weiderpass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency pushed for measures such as higher taxes, minimum prices, and raising the legal drinking age, as well as limiting the density of alcohol retailers, restricting hours or days of sale, banning alcohol marketing, and implementing government-controlled alcohol sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These policies all help to reduce drinking and, in turn, lower cancer risk, IARC said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a&lt;a href="https://www.iarc.who.int/news-events/modelling-the-impact-of-increased-alcohol-taxation-on-alcohol-attributable-cancers-in-the-who-european-region" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2021 study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;found that doubling alcohol excise taxes could have prevented 6 per cent of new alcohol-related cancer cases and deaths in 2019 in the WHO's European region, which spans Europe and Central Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Raising awareness about the cancer risks of alcohol and the fact that no level of drinking is safe is critical,” said Dr Béatrice Lauby-Secretan, deputy head of IARC's evidence synthesis and classification branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone has a role to play in changing the current norms and values surrounding alcohol consumption," she added.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

Antidepressants had similar carryover effects, as did proton pump inhibitors, medications millions take for acid reflux and heartburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The microbiome is the body's collection of beneficial bacteria. Its health relies on a diverse population of bacteria to fight disease, absorb nutrients and regulate immune and metabolic systems. It is influenced by everything from diet and lifestyle to the medications a person takes, including common prescription drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study confirmed that commonly prescribed medications, ranging from antibiotics to antidepressants, consistently reduce the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13882945/The-microbiome-miracle-Good-bacteria-dont-just-live-gut-body-help-ward-deadly-illnesses-cancers-infections-doctors-reveal-nurture-ultimate-guide.html"&gt;diversity of gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes for years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A less diverse microbiome is linked to a weaker gut barrier, chronic inflammation and a compromised immune system. This state of imbalance, known as dysbiosis, creates a state of chronic inflammation and weakened immune defense that is a recognized breeding ground &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14639877/Scientists-cancer-diet-mistake-gut-health-leukemia.html"&gt;for cancer development&lt;/a&gt;, specifically, colorectal &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-5bca6ea0-a862-11f0-b36e-c3dba671310f"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dysbiosis creates a gut environment dominated by cancer-promoting bacteria, which can trigger tumor growth by stimulating blood vessel formation, uncontrolled cell division and the evasion of cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;The Estonian team's findings impact tens of millions of Americans. Annually, hundreds of millions of antibiotic prescriptions are written, while about 30 million people each take benzodiazepines, beta-blockers or SSRIs (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To investigate the long-term effects of medications on gut bacteria, an Estonian study genetically analyzed stool samples from 2,509 adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By revisiting 328 of them four years later with new samples and checking their prescription records, they pinpointed the effects of common drugs like acid reflux pills, antidepressants and anxiety medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ninety percent of 186 medications tested disrupted the gut microbiome, and for many, including antibiotics, antidepressants and proton pump inhibitors, the effects persisted for over three years after the last dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antibiotics have the most severe and long-lasting impact on the gut microbiome. The study found that the effects of drugs like azithromycin and penicillin remain detectable for over three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The reduction in bacterial diversity from antibiotics never fully recovered, suggesting the damage is permanent or lasts for many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like antibiotics, benzodiazepines were associated with fewer species of bacteria, changing the overall composition of the gut microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drugs' effects persisted for over three years and were cumulative, with more prescriptions leading to greater gut imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among all non-antibiotic drugs, beta-blockers were one of the top disruptors of the gut microbiome, accounting for a significant portion of the variation in people's gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) also caused long-term damage to the gut microbiome, reducing diversity and creating a pro-inflammatory state that can fuel cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These changes to people's microbial ecosystems persisted for years after people stopped taking the medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The second round of testing, though smaller, solidly proved that proton pump inhibitors and various antibiotics also have lasting impacts on the gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A dysbiotic gut often has a ‘leaky’ barrier, allowing bacteria and their toxins to enter the bloodstream. This triggers a persistent, low-grade inflammatory state throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A depleted microbiome is less effective at detoxifying harmful compounds and produces lower levels of protective molecules like butyrate, leaving the body more vulnerable to exposures or events that damage the cells’ DNA and can initiate the development of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers deduced in 2024 that changes in the gut microbiome, including the proliferation of bad bacteria, including some previously unknown strains, has been linked to &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-70702-1"&gt;between 23 and 40 percent&lt;/a&gt; of colorectal cancer cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They proved that these newly discovered bacteria can directly trigger the growth of precancerous growths in the colon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found that the gut microbiome can create a pre-cancerous environment by causing changes in colon cells that are crucial for the structural integrity of tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;The bar graph portion of the graphic shows that beta-blockers were the top disruptor. The study used a color-coded chart (in shades of blue below) to show that most common medications are strongly linked to a major loss of gut bacterial diversity. Darker shades of blue indicated a stronger negative correlation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Oliver Aasmets of the University of Tartu Institute of Genomics and lead author of the latest Estonian study, said in a statement: ‘Most microbiome studies only consider current medications, but our results show that past drug use can be just as important as it is a surprisingly strong factor in explaining individual microbiome differences.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their findings were published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.00541-25"&gt;mSystems&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These findings apply to tens of millions of Americans. In the US, healthcare providers wrote approximately 270 million antibiotic prescriptions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 30 million Americans take benzodiazepines and 30 million take beta-blockers. Further, approximately 30 million Americans take SSRIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The World Health Organization sounded the alarm Monday about a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/13-10-2025-who-warns-of-widespread-resistance-to-common-antibiotics-worldwide" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;growing threat of drug-resistant bacteria&lt;/a&gt; around the globe that could undermine life-saving treatments, an issue Wayne State University researchers have been warning about for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;One in 6 laboratory-confirmed bacterial infections that led to common infections in people worldwide in 2023 were resistant to antibiotic treatments, according to a WHO report released Monday that reviewed data from more than 100 countries. From 2018-23, antibiotic resistance increased in more than 40% of the pathogen-antibiotic combinations monitored, rising to more than 70% in some African nations, the report found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;This growing threat to global health, including in the United States, compromises the ability of antibiotics and other drugs to treat infections and protect patients during surgeries, said WHO officials, who called the growing resistance to antibiotics "widespread, increasing and unevenly distributed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Antimicrobial resistance is outpacing advances in modern medicine, threatening the health of families worldwide,” WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a Monday statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/-mm-/46ffa7acfb1aa06c1b12a1e01effc5ff0fe17641/c=0-142-2453-1522/local/-/media/2016/05/27/DetroitNews/B99399644Z.1_20160527070610_000_G37V7K45.2-0.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=372&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/-mm-/46ffa7acfb1aa06c1b12a1e01effc5ff0fe17641/c=0-142-2453-1522/local/-/media/2016/05/27/DetroitNews/B99399644Z.1_20160527070610_000_G37V7K45.2-0.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=744&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="This 2006 colorized image from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows a strain of E. coli bacteria.

The reported number of clinical cases of Candida auris — a type of yeast that is resistant to antifungal medications and can spread in health care facilities — increased almost fivefold from 2019 to 2022, the CDC found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"We are so interconnected, and organisms spread very easily," Michigan Chief Medical Executive Natasha Bagdasarian told The Detroit News on Monday. "There are different patterns depending on place, but the (drug-resistant bacteria) are really everywhere. What’s happening on the other side of the globe really impacts us here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;More than 2.8 million antimicrobial-resistant infections occur each year in the United States, according to the CDC, which added that its &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/antimicrobial-resistance/media/pdfs/2019-ar-threats-report-508.pdf" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;2019 report&lt;/a&gt; found that more than 35,000 people die as a result. Antimicrobial-resistant infections were associated with nearly 5 million deaths worldwide in 2019, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2821%2902724-0/fulltext" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;report released in The Lancet medical journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Wayne State researchers have been studying the impacts of drug-resistant bacteria for years, after drug-resistant bacteria were found among Detroit patients, said Dr. Teena Chopra, an assistant dean in the Wayne State School of Medicine, where she is an infectious diseases expert. She and other Wayne State experts have been stressing it is critical to stop the spread of the drug-resistant bacteria, especially in Detroit and southeast Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"It's been getting worse for years now," Chopra said Monday. "Drug resistance is here ... and, given the population of Detroit who are on antibiotics, it's one of the biggest problems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Detroit is one of America's most impoverished big cities, with a majority Black population that has more chronic health conditions. One of the first reported outbreaks of drug-resistant bacteria occurred in Detroit in the early 1980s, involving intravenous drug users and other patients with medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ghebreyesus warned that doctors around the globe need to use antibiotics responsibly, since an overreliance on antibiotics to treat a variety of ailments has helped lead to the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Our future also depends on strengthening systems to prevent, diagnose and treat infections and on innovating with next-generation antibiotics and rapid point-of-care molecular tests," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Impacts of drug-resistant bacteria&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Detroiters have higher percentages of obesity, diabetes and blood pressure, Chopra said. These conditions require a person to be on antibiotics to treat them, she said. If the antibiotics aren't as effective, people could die of the diseases, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People with other infections, such as those of the bloodstream, urinary tract and gastrointestinal tract, are also at risk of being exposed to drug-resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In its report, the WHO &lt;a&gt;examined worldwide resistance&lt;/a&gt; to 22 antibiotics used to treat common infections. From 2018 to 2023, antibiotic resistance increased an annual average of 5% to 15% in the monitored antibiotics, the report found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The WHO report also looked at eight common bacterial pathogens worldwide, including E. coli and K. pneumoniae, which can lead to severe bloodstream infections that frequently result in sepsis, organ failure and death. The report found that 40% of E. coli infections and 55% of K. pneumoniae infections globally are now resistant to third-generation cephalosporins or a form of antibiotics that includes penicillins, which are the first-choice treatment for these infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The CDC said last month that infections of a type of drug-resistant bacteria called NDM-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-report-finds-sharp-rise-in-dangerous-drug-resistant-bacteria.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;have surged more than 460%&lt;/a&gt; in the United States between 2019 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The estimated U.S. cost to treat infections caused by six antimicrobial-resistant germs frequently found in health care is more than $4.6 billion annually, according to a CDC study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Across the world, the WHO report estimated that antibiotic resistance is highest in the South-East Asian and Eastern Mediterranean regions, where 1 in 3 reported infections was resistant. The South-East Asian region covers a quarter of the globe's population, while the Eastern Mediterranean area covers countries such as Afghanistan, Egypt, Tunisia and Pakistan, or about 10% of the world's population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In the African region, 1 in 5 infections was resistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Causes of drug-resistant bacteria&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The increased use and misuse of antibiotics or antimicrobials, along with other stressors, such as pollution, create conditions for microorganisms to develop resistance and bacteria in water, soil and air can become resistant to common antibiotics following contact with resistant microorganisms, the WHO report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"As soon as antibiotics started, bacteria developed to be able to resist them," Michigan's Bagdasarian said. "Now multiple different classes of bacteria can resist them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The exposure to the bacteria can occur through contact with polluted waters, contaminated food, the inhalation of fungal spores, and other pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/presto/2020/12/15/PDTN/b3dc3b83-4623-4c93-a1a4-0fd7d71a06a4-Teena_Chopra_MD_2020_hori.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=440&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/presto/2020/12/15/PDTN/b3dc3b83-4623-4c93-a1a4-0fd7d71a06a4-Teena_Chopra_MD_2020_hori.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=880&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Drug-resistant infections have been a problem that has worsened over the decades, said Dr. Teena Chopra, an infectious diseases expert at Wayne State University in Detroit.

People who lack access to doctors are more likely not to seek treatment, which allows the bacteria to become a more serious problem and potentially spread, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;An outbreak of community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus, or a drug-resistant bacterium, was reported as early as 1982 in Detroit, where more than half of the patients were intravenous drug users, and the other half had medical conditions that also put them at risk, according to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5314345/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;paper by the Infectious Disease Clinics of North America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The proportion of community-acquired staphylococcal infections resistant to methicillin rose from 3% in March 1980 to 38% in September 1981 among 165 patients seen at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, according to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7114629/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;1982 paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. "Drug abuse, serious underlying illness, previous antimicrobial therapy, and previous hospitalization were all associated with the development of this infection," according to the paper's abstract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Other strains of drug-resistant bacterium were also discovered during this outbreak, according to a paper in the National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;What can be done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Although the number of countries reporting bacteria-resistance issues has ballooned fourfold to 104 countries since 2016, almost half of the countries did not report data in 2023, the WHO said. And it warned that about half of the reporting countries still lacked the systems "to generate reliable data."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Generating more reliable data, especially in underserved areas, by 2030 can help inform treatments and policies to fight this public health threat, according to the WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For patients, Chopra said, only use antibiotics when prescribed by health care professionals and take all of the prescribed antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But she also pointed to sweeping changes she believes could help slow the rise of the bacteria. Legislation requiring scientists to check for and report the bacteria, worldwide standards on the use of antibiotics for livestock and more federal funding for research to treat the infections would help, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Investments in and creating incentives for the creation of novel antibiotics that bacteria haven't yet formed a resistance to is another solution, Chopra and Bagdasarian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Another solution is antibiotic stewardship, which is already common in most U.S. hospitals, Bagdasarian said. This is a program in which doctors and pharmacists learn the appropriate use of antibiotics to prevent resistance, improve patient outcomes, and preserve antibiotic effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For those suffering from an infection or showing symptoms, such as fever, a headache or fatigue, Chopra suggested seeing a primary care physician as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"The faster we see it, the faster we can treat it," she said. "Any delays in detection could make it harder to treat and cause it to spread."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But this time of year, especially, it's important to make sure patients are being treated for the right condition, Bagdasarian said. Viral infections can't be treated by antibiotics, and using antibiotics to treat respiratory infections will lead to overuse, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"We want to avoid a future where we have bacterial infections that we can’t treat," Bagdasarian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;satwood@detroitnews.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 03:01:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9wFBVV95cUxPclFfRUZZU1c3UHB2Mk85UVZCWURZUkFVaWpMUkp2U2N3NnJzMUZ6UDlNb0dfd2FKRlRrbDFDQktBRDZpR2ZRcVhYUXMyVWFPVnlSVHI4dXVKTFRBRkVySi1rWTBKZ2lmTm9oR0hhU05MZHEtbUhuRnFmaDBqajVrS2V4UWw2bm9KUzhZeDRDUThMTk9rQmxtcEw1SHRSczVuNmFtaVV0MGVydXFJSVBSYUtlUTNOSnNJNkc1YVQ3U2tPcm9aYlg0bmJTOW54ZEg4dDJKYzVoZk5XckROY1RXM2tMSy1xbmlwMTVqSTBVYnZpTUZWMG1B</guid></item><item><title>吃超加工食品可能与吸烟一样有害- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/eating-ultra-processed-foods-could-be-as-harmful-as-smoking/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 02:55:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxNbkV0a193eWdfLUxJUHl3ZkpYNEk5cDVBaml5ZDAzVnpmeTFiYXVEek5MVVVvamQ1eGRuUHJjVUdyWjlOUldXNEo3cHJycC15UmxQZmVUQjQ5RVpVcF9zb2tkVV9wZF9mMlF2aGVQcGlLbnZwRmVXZUhMVjYwSko4eUJsUUVhNk9ZelpVRGxR</guid></item><item><title>研究显示，天然甜味剂促进脱发的常见治疗方法- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/natural-sweetener-boosts-a-common-treatment-for-hair-loss-study-reveals</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A leading treatment for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_hair_loss"&gt;androgenetic alopecia&lt;/a&gt; (AGA) – the classic pattern hair loss – could be made more effective with the clever addition of the natural sweetener stevioside, derived from the stevia plant (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevia_rebaudiana"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stevia rebaudiana&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/18238-minoxidil-topical-solution-or-foam"&gt;Minoxidil&lt;/a&gt; is a popular treatment for AGA that is rubbed into the scalp: it works by revitalizing hair follicles with increased blood flow, but not much of it gets absorbed into the skin. Various forms of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2023.126013"&gt;microneedle&lt;/a&gt; patches have been tested to improve penetration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, researchers from China and Australia combined stevioside with microneedle patches, primarily because stevioside helps minoxidil dissolve much better in water. Using this method, much more minoxidil should get under the skin to the hair follicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/decades-of-studies-link-suicide-risk-with-common-hair-loss-treatment"&gt;Decades of Studies Link Suicide Risk With Common Hair Loss Treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach was tested in mice that had been genetically engineered to lose hair, and the results were promising. Much more of the minoxidil made it into the skin, and more hair grew back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a significant increase in hair follicle transition to the growth phase, which resulted in 67.5 percent coverage of the treatment area by day 35," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202503575"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Collectively, the results highlight the potential of the stevioside microneedle delivery system for the treatment of AGA."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_177065" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177065" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/MouseResults.jpg" alt="Mice baldness" class="wp-image-177065 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/MouseResults.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/MouseResults-512x415.jpg 512w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/MouseResults-600x486.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-177065" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The new treatment significantly improved hair growth in mice.

Hair growth started around a week earlier, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As promising as these results are, they're for mouse hair and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-hair-loss-drug-approved-restores-80-of-hair-loss-in-some-alopecia-patients"&gt;not human hair&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers are still experimenting with the microneedle delivery system and the minoxidil mix to find the best method of delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The benefits and drawbacks of various technical methods, such as metal or soluble microneedles and sustained-release systems, should be evaluated in conjunction with specific clinical scenarios," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202503575"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further testing will be required in larger animal studies before human  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="177062" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; can get underway, and only at that point can scientists assess how these microneedle patches might work on people – while any side effects or other complications can also be weighed up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term viability also needs to be assessed. Current minoxidil treatments need to be applied &lt;a href="https://drhair.co.uk/blog/how-often-should-i-apply-minoxidil/"&gt;at least once a day&lt;/a&gt;, and while microneedle delivery might change that, it needs to be suitable for regular applications.&lt;br&gt;

"Using stevioside to enhance minoxidil delivery represents a promising step toward more effective and natural treatments for hair loss, potentially benefiting millions worldwide," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.wiley.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Can-a-Stevia-derived-sweetener-improve-hair-loss-treatment/default.aspx"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; pharmacologist Lifeng Kang, from the University of Sydney in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202503575"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advanced Healthcare Materials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But based on the records gathered, the WHO estimates one in three bacterial infections in south-east Asia and the eastern Mediterranean were resistant to antibiotics in 2023, and one in five in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) arises when pathogens evolve to withstand the drugs used to kill them. In 2021, 7.7 million people globally died from bacterial infections. Drug resistance contributed to 4.71 million of the deaths, with 1.14 million directly attributed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The report raises serious concerns about gram-negative bacteria – those protected by an outer shell – such as &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;, which cause some of the most severe bacterial infections that often lead to sepsis, organ failure and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hutin said 40% of &lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; coli&lt;/em&gt; and more than 55% of &lt;em&gt;K&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; are resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, the first choice treatment for such infections. In the WHO African region, resistance often exceeds 70%, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Resistance to critical second-choice antibiotics, particularly carbapenems and fluoroquinolones, was also rising among key gram-negative bacteria such as &lt;em&gt;Acinetobacter&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;K&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; and salmonella, the report found. “These antibiotics are critical for treating severe infections and their growing ineffectiveness is narrowing the treatment options,” Hutin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Manica Balasegaram at the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership said the report added to evidence that drug-resistant infections had reached “a critical tipping point”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The most difficult-to-treat gram-negative infections are now beginning to outpace antibiotic development, either because the right antibiotics are not reaching the people who need them, or because they are not being developed in the first place,” he said. “As a result, the number of AMR deaths is &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2824%2901867-1/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;now expected to rise sharply&lt;/a&gt;, increasing by 70% by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s not enough to develop new antibiotics, they have to be the right ones, those that target infections that have the greatest public health impact. We are failing to replace the antibiotics that are being lost to resistance, and this latest WHO report shows that the consequences of that are now finally beginning to be felt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Until now, the AMR narrative has focused rightfully on the overuse of antibiotics, but this isn’t enough. To avoid the tipping point, we must now also focus efforts on accelerating innovation and increasing their appropriate use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Sanjib Bhakta, who works on drugs to tackle AMR at University College London, said the WHO report revealed “an alarming escalation in resistance”, particularly among gram-negative bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He said combating AMR required “tailored global action” from strengthening surveillance and diagnostics to ensuring equitable access to narrow-spectrum antibiotics. Preventing infections was also important through cleaner water, better sanitation and hygiene and vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Crucially, renewed investment is needed to support interdisciplinary, blue-sky research aimed at discovering novel therapeutic interventions against drug-resistant bacteria,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="d59ac631-67a1-41f5-8764-9ab5f26a9d65" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.GuideAtomBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="GuideAtomWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Contact us about this story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;html&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Secure Messaging in the Guardian app&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US drug epidemic has slowed in recent months, however, amid a crackdown on drug trafficking by the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overdose fatalities have dropped nearly 24 percent over the 12 months to April 2025, the latest available, with an estimated 76,516 fatalities, compared to an estimated 101,363 fatalities over the previous year-long period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not clear whether bluetoothing is already taking place in the US, but some experts have warned that addicts may be put off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They say that one reason the practice is not more widespread is that it tends to deliver users with a diminished high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It often is not clear how much of a high those who infuse themselves with another drug users blood receive, with this potentially being no different to a placebo effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Catharine Cook, the executive director of Harm Reduction International, a nonprofit based in the UK, told the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/world/asia/bluetoothing-drug-blood-sharing.html"&gt;New York Times:&lt;/a&gt; 'It's the perfect way of spreading HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'&lt;span&gt;It’s a wake-up call for health systems and governments, the speed with which you can end up with a massive spike of infection because of the efficiency of transmission.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Fiji, in 2014 the country had fewer than 500 people living with HIV, but by 2024 this number had surged to approximately 5,900.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the same year, the Pacific island nation recorded 1,583 new cases of HIV, equivalent to a 13-fold increase on its usual five-year average. About half of all new infected patients said they had been sharing needles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows drug overdose deaths by year in the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the percent change in drug overdose deaths from April 2024 to April 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kalesi Volatabu, executive director of the non-profit Drug Free Fiji, described to the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m42dwvlk8o"&gt;BBC &lt;/a&gt;the moment that she witnessed the practice firsthand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I saw the needle with the blood, it was right there in front of me,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This young woman, she'd already had the shot and she's taking out the blood, and then you've got other girls, other adults, already lining up to be hit with this thing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'It's not just needles they're sharing, they're sharing the blood.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Estimates suggest about 33.5 percent of drug users in the US share needles, which also poses a risk of transmitting HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts warn that the virus, alongside other diseases such as hepatitis, can get onto the needle if it is used by an infected person, and then be transferred to another individual who also uses the same needle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In general, HIV rates in the US have fallen since 2017. However, due to disruptions in care in 2020 from the Covid pandemic, which means HIV cases were likely missed, new diagnoses have been slightly increased. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the CDC, in the US and its associated territories, there were 39,201 new HIV diagnoses in 2023, the latest data available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is an increase from the 37,721 new cases in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the 2023 cases, the newest CDC report on HIV shows 518 diagnoses were associated with intravenous drug use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts emphasize that HIV is no longer a death sentence, saying that there are drugs available that can slow the virus' replication and allow someone infected to live a full and normal life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The practice of bluetoothing was first recorded in Tanzania around 2010, where it quickly spread from the country's inner city to the suburbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Zanzibar, a tourism haven in the nation where the practice took hold, researchers found HIV rates were up to 30 times higher than those recorded in the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has also been recorded in Lesotho, a small African nation bordering South Africa, and Pakistan, where people have sold half-used blood-infused syringes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:27:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPZjdTWGFEZl9iRDlfUlFMQ1dEY2t4Qkw5VEREME52VzZocFlxYXZyWFJpYS1KU19iZDV6SGptUkR6aVQxUjNPQm01dDBjWjhwd01ZdlhPUFhOMUxQT3g2MVZXRTlYMFR3UEpFM1BLamQ2NDBFa1NySXdObEppSkc0dExDb2pQVm5jRmM5VlM4V3Z0MTc4MWdBT1hjQzLSAaIBQVVfeXFMT2ItYXB6YUtORVpkeThycUg3MTRiYS1US3ZjVkY5elF2TkozMmdCYmt6cE9seWJmZTNMOVJkY0dqcm52MzRYMjJENUtJRHhza05HekkxelplVFZRQzU2UVk1R0VfbWVrRjJUYURaYU43MWVDYkhPd0c1TEJmNHRNb2ZmTnZsa3hCUzZZZlA3THRpUENXelJSQ054MnotNWhBN2F3</guid></item><item><title>新的1天手术在同一手术中切除癌症并重建乳房- ABC新闻-突发新闻、最新新闻和视频</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/US/new-1-day-surgery-removes-cancer-reconstructs-breast/story?id=126492962</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;When the results of her routine mammogram came back with a diagnosis of stage 0 DCIS breast cancer in multiple areas of her right breast, Athaliah McPherson, a hairstylist and mom of one, said she wasn’t surprised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I knew something was off," McPherson told ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;McPherson’s diagnosis was not life-threatening in and of itself, but left unchecked, it might have developed into something more serious. Typically, doctors treat DCIS with partial or full breast removal surgery, sometimes followed by radiation or hormone therapy to lower future risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;McPherson was referred to the Montefiore Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;There, her team -- led by Dr. Pedro Piccinini, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon, and Dr. Maureen McEvoy, a breast surgical oncologist -- recommended McPherson undergo a new procedure called total breast reconstruction, which combines mastectomy (breast removal) and reconstruction in a single surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;McPherson recalled that her aunt had been diagnosed with the same type of breast cancer and faced multiple complications after her mastectomy. She was open to an alternative, and six months after her diagnosis, McPherson decided total breast reconstruction was a “no-brainer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Combining the two procedures allows for the removal of breast tissue and rebuilding the breast immediately, instead of doing two separate operations. The surgeon places the breast implants between the chest muscles to provide added stability, helping reduce the risk of distortion, movement, infection and fluid buildup. By avoiding the need to cut through or lift muscle, it can also lessen pain, speed recovery, and create a more natural breast shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;Medical personnel use a mammogram to examine a woman's breast for breast cancer.

That delay often heightens the emotional distress of a breast cancer treatment while the patient waits to regain her breast shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Compared to traditional mastectomy, the immediate impact of total breast reconstruction is, as Piccinini told ABC News, "better results, lower complication rates, shorter hospital stays and reduced overall costs." He added that the procedure is covered by most insurance plans, making it more accessible to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“The first day after surgery, I was up and walking,” McPherson said. “I was back to work within six weeks.” She credits her quick recovery to the ease of the surgery, and active lifestyle, and the care she received at Montefiore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“I am 100% happy with my results,” McPherson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The two-for-one approach represents a notable shift in breast cancer surgery, said Piccinini. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Improving a patient’s physical appearance after breast cancer treatment can have a powerful ripple effect. Patients often become “more outgoing, experience improved relationships, and develop a stronger self-image,” Piccinini explained. These benefits can contribute to better health outcomes and, in some cases, longer survival, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;McPherson agreed. “Do something that will help you feel better, make you look better, and help you have the will to live,” she advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Piccinini and his team are presenting their technique to other oncologists at national conferences throughout the country, aiming, he said, to spread the word and advance the standard of care for all breast cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As for McPherson, she is currently in remission. Her advice to other women: “Do not skip your yearly mammogram.” And if you do get a diagnosis, explore all your options for treatment and recovery, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Cyrus Mowdawalla, MD, is a resident physician in Internal Medicine from Montefiore Medical Center and a contributing correspondent of the ABC News Medical Unit.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News - Breaking News, Latest News and Videos</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:01:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQbzYxQ3NCZ1lEaW5mZk8zT0IteUx1R2VfU3VwbC02MDlpYTh1ckdBaGFNTzlJazNBWUtYTUl1c19yS2NlZXNteUdBbDQ4cGV4SXV6Z0VSTWN5aDVVTkNUTWlPV2RiMDJmYk5TSHFrbnNjOVFZRGpyanc4c3lacTVNRFVnSGxvbTFLdFhiN05yN2FJVWdNdWFOV0kxdDhIZ9IBowFBVV95cUxQQVZpN2hJWkVPbVhLNzdLMy13UW1UU0dPbkQwNGxYc0t4NXM4US1DTU50UzZDU2dOcEx3Q3JZWC1sQlhjdmhFR2NSSkpubzdfMHRqM09xc0k4SGlaZkxROXprQXpWaW8xdTlVMnNfaGtDcmk3SmVabGFWckZJOVpHbXdqdXVNWnhyT2pNS3dHQnN5dDhfM0JLZmlDcy05bU9LblE4</guid></item><item><title>随着明尼苏达州禽流感的蔓延，杂货商表示，他们预计这不会影响感恩节计划- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minnesota-bird-flu-impact-fall-2025-thanksgiving/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minnesota is seeing a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/bird-flu-returns-minnesota-vaccine-turkey-farms/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;resurgence in bird flu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; cases this fall. The virus has infected thousands of turkeys and chickens in eight counties over just the last few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are trying to figure it out, for sure. I tell you, it's so disheartening," said Jake Vlaminck, president of the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vlaminck owns and operates Fahlun Farms near Lake Lillian. When his turkeys first got avian influenza a few years ago, he &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minnesota-farm-bird-flu-laser/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;installed lasers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to keep away ducks and geese —   birds that spread the illness. That seemed to be working until last week, when his father-in-law noticed gulls on the property. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He said he saw them on the roof of the barn. He scared them away. That was on a Monday morning. Come Wednesday morning, our birds started feeling sick," said Vlaminck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Friday, they tested positive for bird flu, and so did one of his neighbors' barns. All the turkeys needed to be put down to stop the spread. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"On the first site, we had to depopulate, it was about 33,000 birds. The other site we depopulated, we are closer to 38,000," said Vlaminck. "Unfortunately, us farmers, we are no better off now than we were 10 years ago."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a consumer standpoint, Thanksgiving is still a month and a half away, but grocery stores don't anticipate this latest outbreak will impact prices or supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Last year they said the same thing and it didn't affect us at all," said Mark Alger, the meat manager at Marketplace Foods in Watertown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a couple of weeks, the first holiday turkeys will start arriving and he's not expecting problems.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've got Butterball. We've got Best Choice, we've got Jennie-O," said Alger. "It's a busy time of the year, the holidays."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It'll also be a busy time for Vlaminck, as he works to get his numbers back up while pushing for a solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The USDA needs to come up with a vaccine strategy and figure out what's the best way to protect all the poultry in the U.S., protect our food supply, and still make sure we can have foreign trade," said Vlaminck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USDA wants to remind people that turkey bought in grocery stores is safe to eat. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;
