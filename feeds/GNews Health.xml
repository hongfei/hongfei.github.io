Most of those cases – 85% – involved wounds being exposed to seawater, and 92% of the infected had one underlying health condition, the health department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Over the previous decade, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/louisiana" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; has registered an average of 10 Vibrio infections and a single death, state health department officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The higher numbers in Louisiana come after scientific researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-28247-2" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; of evidence that Vibrio infections are becoming more common amid rising sea surface temperatures associated with the climate crisis – which has primarily been spurred by human emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Vibrio bacteria flourish in warm coastal waters and proliferate between May and October. Infections can result from exposing an open wound to seawater or from consuming seafood that is either raw or undercooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;About one in five people who contract Vibrio vulnificus in particular die – occasionally within two days of feeling sick from the infection. Those who do survive such an infection on occasion require limb amputation or intensive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The story of one man who grew up in New Orleans, and died after contracting Vibrio vulnificus in July in nearby Bay St Louis, Mississippi, vividly illustrated the dangers of the bacterium to the public in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Basil Kennedy, 77, evidently contracted the bacterium after scraping his leg on a boat trailer, his daughter told the Louisiana news station &lt;a href="https://www.fox8live.com/2025/08/12/mississippi-man-with-new-orleans-ties-dead-flesh-eating-bacteria/?fbclid=IwY2xjawMIJmBleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFiWHRIU0s4a3JKSzlEVnF4AR4JF8LK9Y54BiehiI1D2POkhtUW-W1YaB6A7tX7tTSHMpz-UqfKNzquUUcBFA_aem_Jlk9wK-fDHfZz4cxZ-24MA" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;WVUE&lt;/a&gt;. Kennedy reportedly cleaned and bandaged the wound, and he avoided getting into the water, thinking nothing more of it. But in about three days, his health sharply declined, and he died, his daughter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kay Kennedy Regimbal told the station “there doesn’t need to be fear of the water” despite her father’s death – but she added that “there really needs to be an education and an understanding of how to be prepared for a situation where you may be exposed or there is a potential risk”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Symptoms of Vibrio infection can include gastrointestinal illness, an unusually severe wound or – as associated with bloodstream infection – fever, blistering and dangerously low blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The US usually reports about 150 to 200 cases of Vibrio vulnificus a year. About half of those cases occur in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. Louisiana officials said the most cases and deaths have been in their state and Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 18:36:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOOGJoRUk3N0lPam9lUDV4NXdUWEduN0F4ODVuMVc4dGhoak9qeW9Yb1JxN0tjUjBIS2VsLTB2eGZESkJuZUpCUjk0VE1IcVJNWGRFdFNoV3B4SEw2UWhHQTNqSG9haVI3WVViV2RwbERmemF5Tm8yX0VrbkREYzIxOW1BTlhJaWVtVkxhYVRVOA</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心疫苗顾问决定不推迟婴儿乙型肝炎疫苗注射的更改- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-panel-hep-b-babies-data-rcna232394</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f65185" class="body-graf"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is not expected to change recommendations for hepatitis B vaccines in newborns, after its panel of advisers tabled Friday a much-awaited vote on the issue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-386654" class="body-graf"&gt;The panel had been expected to recommend delaying the use of the vaccine in babies, currently administered shortly after birth, but some members expressed frustration over a lack of evidence about side effects and said more discussion was needed. One member also said the voting language wasn’t clear and could lead to confusing guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0e1c88" class="body-graf"&gt;The unorthodox decision follows a chaotic, unconventional voting process for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), whose 12 members were all appointed under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the last few months. Many have expressed skepticism about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-db5bab" class="body-graf"&gt;The members were due to vote Friday on whether to delay the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine until a child is at least 1 month old, provided the mother tests negative for the virus. Currently, the first dose is given within 24 hours of birth because hepatitis B — an incurable infection that can lead to liver disease, cancer and death — can be transmitted from mother to child during delivery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-258047" class="body-graf"&gt;The hepatitis B vaccine has become a target of Republican legislators, including Rand Paul of Kentucky, who question the medical necessity of protecting newborns if their mothers have tested negative for the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bccfe3" class="body-graf"&gt;ACIP member Dr. Robert Malone said Thursday that the committee took up the subject because “a significant population” in the U.S. has concerns about vaccine policy, including giving the hepatitis B vaccine at birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5d513e" class="body-graf"&gt;However, many public health experts questioned the need for a vote without new data to analyze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-27e0cd" class="body-graf"&gt;Minutes before tabling the subject, the ACIP voted unanimously to recommend testing all pregnant women for hepatitis B. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said the test is covered across insurance programs and the goal of the vote was to encourage providers and health systems to increase testing rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-776e8d" class="body-graf"&gt;At the meeting on Thursday, CDC staffers &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-09-18-19/02-langer-hep-b-508.pdf__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!oU4Q9e_38wyod3qsCKl_7D82SjN7OstS2ldBmu3EqyV-o31SM2XBkZiE0YK48MAU2QrYje_19WDXlAWPDKUJwPrXjHrd$" target="_blank"&gt;summarized the results of 17 studies&lt;/a&gt;, which found that the hepatitis B vaccine is overwhelmingly safe and has helped to virtually eliminate hepatitis B infections among newborns. The agency also noted that many pregnant women aren’t screened for hepatitis B in the U.S., making it hard to rely on testing to decide which children to vaccinate. According to the CDC, 12-16% of pregnant women in the U.S. are never tested for hepatitis B during pregnancy — and even if they are, some cases can be missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3cafe7" class="body-graf"&gt;Several ACIP members pushed back on what they said were omissions in the CDC’s presentations, pointing to individual studies and anecdotes that they said raised questions about neuro-developmental side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e064ba" class="body-graf"&gt;Two committee members, Malone and Vicky Pebsworth — both of whom have a history of sharing misinformation about vaccines — said the CDC presentations omitted a &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/13164/chapter/10" target="_blank"&gt;2012 report from the Institute of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. The report said it couldn’t determine whether hepatitis B vaccines were associated with brain inflammation because no studies had properly looked at that research question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c60234" class="body-graf"&gt;“The absence of data that statistically proves lack of safety does not mean that the product is safe,” Malone said on Friday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7afc72" class="body-graf"&gt;Pebsworth also raised concerns about CDC data showing irritability or fussiness in some infants who received the hepatitis B vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f59d79" class="body-graf"&gt;“These are not trivial reactions,” Pebsworth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cd9b05" class="body-graf"&gt;However, such symptoms are hard to attribute to vaccines because infants can be irritable or fussy regardless of vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f1ec3e" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrician and the only current ACIP member who has previously served on the committee, pushed back on Pebsworth’s concern, noting that irritability or restlessness “are certainly not objective parameters that should be used to assess safety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f81574" class="body-graf"&gt;He added that no vaccine is 100% safe or effective, but that the committee was meant to decide whether protection from vaccines outweighs any possible risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a2cb0b" class="body-graf"&gt;“When you apply that to a newborn hepatitis B vaccine, I don’t think there’s any question whatsoever that the benefit far outweighs any adverse side effect,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4e4e0a" class="body-graf"&gt;Cases of acute hepatitis B infections among children plummeted after the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5730a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;began recommending a universal dose&lt;/a&gt; at birth in 1991. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-896a09" class="body-graf"&gt;It's unclear whether ACIP will revisit the subject in the future. If they do, liaisons from the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, the American College of Physicians and the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine called on the committee to return to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/media/pdfs/2024/09/ACIP-Evidence-to-Recommendations-Framework-cdc.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;a framework for vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt; that has long guided the advisory panel's decisions. The framework considers a vaccine's risk and benefits, whether a recommendation is feasible and how it would impact health equity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3bbc2a" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Amy Middleman, a liaison for the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine, said it's easy to be distracted by conflicting studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-86845c" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“I would urge the committee to use the methodical, scientific method to weigh the risks and benefits appropriately,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 17:06:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQN2J1QU1MSGIzX0o2TWRjQWFFcnBETE9FQ2k0ZmZsWHppeFhPM1J4OUdPTTRBV3YtcWh4akxfNThpM2J2Z3RSZG84a0M5RHRBRzl2Wl9feFByX2M2djhZZUQ1cnRqelhFYjJLNEpGNkRqX1Nzd0lDSm5QMjlfSHFUd2RrYmVQMVljNVhOSjZWdHVYU05RZmVQX0FOcUXSAVZBVV95cUxQNnpaeGFKeFhxLW5aNjd1Q3JHUnA4V0hoM1RFeEU5NTE0dm95dEV4UVJVdUk5QVRDUTRTWHpwYlhDWXRwX05EQzk0Njlsc3Z3Q0QtOEZpZw</guid></item><item><title>观看直播：疾控中心咨询小组讨论COVID-19疫苗风险，与外部专家就流程进行争论- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-covid-19-hepatitis-b-vaccines/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;After the tabled hep B vote, some liaison members from top medical organizations shared their agreement for holding off on making changes to the current recommendations. Some also urged more transparency in how decisions will be made on future potential recommendation changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would urge the committee to use the methodical scientific method to weigh the risks and benefits appropriately," said Dr. Amy Middleman, a liaison for the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. She added, "This is important for all vaccine decisions, and this is what I think some of us are really concerned about in terms of the absence of it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACIP member Retsef Levi said he appreciated the desire to keep scientific methods but took issue with the liaison member's comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have to say that one thing that puzzles me is that many of the speakers that push for the scientific approach are speaking very confidently in the absence of the gold standard evidence of robust long-term clinical trials against placebo," Levi added, who has been pushing for more research beyond what the CDC has presented during the meetings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When ACIP chair Kulldorff began to move on from the hep B discussion, Dr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians, chimed in asking for more explanation and to call out the committee for muting him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is disrespectful. You want debate and discussion, but you're muting people and silencing them," Goldman said. "Please provide to the public so they can have trust, faith and confidence in vaccination as to what process we are going to be using to properly vet and discuss all future vaccines. … Tell the public how you are going to be analyzing all of these vaccine decisions so we can have confidence in this committee."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff responded that he previously responded to that comment already before moving on to the next agenda matter.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

The good news is, some simple exercises, when incorporated with a healthy diet and consistency, can significantly lead to a leaner and healthier body. &lt;br&gt;Excess belly fat is associated with serious health issues, including the dangerous visceral fat. A study conducted by Harvard University explains how visceral fat is strongly linked with a higher risk of heart disease. The good thing is, studies have concluded exercising can significantly reduce belly fat. A recent study conducted in the US found that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29127602/"&gt;high-intensity interval training &lt;/a&gt;significantly reduces total fat mass, abdominal fat and visceral fat mass. &lt;br&gt;Visceral fat is metabolically active and tends to respond faster to lifestyle changes.

&lt;p&gt;He summed up the discussion succinctly: "The only thing that we're discussing here is if there's some benefit or removal of harm that comes from waiting a month. And I have not seen any data that says that there is any benefit to the infant of waiting a month, but there are a number of potential harms to the infant of waiting a month."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panel member Robert Malone, who has falsely claimed that COVID-19 vaccines cause a form of AIDS, explained that the proposed change for the hep B vaccination was not due to any safety concern or evidence-based reason, but about trust among parents who have been exposed to vaccine misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The signal that is prompting this is not one of safety, it is one of trust," Malone said yesterday. "It is one of parents uncomfortable with this medical procedure being performed at birth in a rather unilateral fashion without significant informed consent at a time in particular when there has been a loss of trust in the public health enterprise and vaccines in general."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dashed decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the questions and uncertainties of the proposed recommendation and the data behind it dogged the committee again this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, the voting language was put on a slide and immediately drew criticism. The language was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a mother tests [hepatitis B]-negative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first dose of the Hepatitis B vaccine is not given until the child is at least one month old.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infants may receive a dose of Hepatitis B vaccine before one month according to individual based decision-making. *&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Also referred to as shared clinical decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hibbeln, the psychiatrist, again pushed back, this time noting that the language of the change is confusing. "You can't say don't give it and then give an opportunity to give it," he said, arguing that shared clinical decision-making is, essentially, all or nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussion quickly spiraled, with another member questioning whether there was any data presented at all on the proposed recommendation. There was a fast motion to table the vote indefinitely, and the motion to table passed in a speedy vote of 11–1, with the ACIP chair, Martin Kulldorff, being the only holdout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the rest of the day, the panel is discussing COVID-19 vaccines. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwl4le003hqgkvga57xg5i@published"&gt;Look up polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS, and every definition you find will state that the hormonal disorder manifests in women and people with ovaries of reproductive age. There’s much that scientists still don’t know about PCOS, including how to cure it. But if you &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;know one thing about the condition, I’d guess that it’s the fact that it occurs in women. Unfortunately for the rest of the spectrum of ages and genders, there’s more to the story. PCOS can affect men and children, too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1um001u3b79l61qcyju@published"&gt;PCOS is a hormonal condition that affects roughly &lt;a href="https://womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome"&gt;1 in 10 women&lt;/a&gt; between the ages of puberty and menopause. It’s marked by an imbalance of reproductive hormones: Women with PCOS often have elevated androgens, the sex hormone responsible for&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“masculine” traits&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;like excess body hair, acne, and male-pattern hair loss. The hormonal imbalance then disrupts ovulation. Despite its name, women diagnosed with PCOS don’t always have ovarian cysts. But some symptoms are highly suggestive of PCOS, including irregular or missed periods, excessive hair growth on the face and body, acne, weight gain, and difficulty conceiving.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1un001v3b799mnm8k85@published"&gt;Some researchers are &lt;a href="https://answers.childrenshospital.org/rethinking-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/"&gt;studying&lt;/a&gt; the emerging understanding that PCOS isn’t just a women’s condition, but a metabolic disorder affecting people of all genders—and one that could be detected as early as childhood.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“For decades, we’ve seen that first-degree male relatives of women with PCOS are also affected,” says Jia Zhu, a pediatric endocrinologist at Boston Children’s Hospital. There are broader metabolic mechanisms at play that aren’t limited to ovarian function, Zhu says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1un001w3b79wm0xrlwf@published"&gt;While people without ovaries can’t technically be diagnosed with PCOS, research shows they can inherit the same genes that cause PCOS in women, leading to what scientists call the “male equivalent of PCOS.” When men inherit these PCOS genes, they don’t develop reproductive problems like their female relatives would. Instead, they may have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123001490?via%3Dihub"&gt;metabolic problems&lt;/a&gt; like obesity and insulin resistance, which increase their risk of diabetes and heart disease. Early male-pattern baldness is also associated with PCOS genes.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1un001x3b79rz4aizfy@published"&gt;Given how common obesity, diabetes, and heart disease are, how can physicians be sure these metabolic problems in men are related to PCOS genetics? It’s all about specific patterns (like early baldness &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;metabolic dysfunction) and not isolated symptoms. And there’s one particular genetic research tool, the polygenic risk score, which proves especially helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1un001y3b79cte94ibr@published"&gt;The risk score helps physicians&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;understand how PCOS genetics work in both women and men. It measures how much a person is inherently prone to a disease based on the combined effect of multiple genes, considering hundreds or thousands of tiny differences across the entire length of a person’s genetic material. In their &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8947237/"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt;, Zhu and her team observed a 9 percent increase in the odds of obesity in men for every meaningful increase in the polygenic risk score.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1uo001z3b79tj83rogq@published"&gt;Research also shows that the condition is less age-dependent than previously thought. Children who have a mother, sister, or other close relative affected by PCOS can develop symptoms themselves, Zhu says. “The clinical risk factor is the early development of pubic or [armpit] hair growth before the age of 8 in girls,” she explains. Boys who have genetic exposure to PCOS tend to reach puberty at an earlier age as well. Kids of all genders with higher polygenic risk scores have been shown to have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37690116/"&gt;higher body mass index and increased fat mass&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1uo00203b79mpqtnpu3@published"&gt;For now, no standardized approach exists for diagnosing or treating the PCOS equivalent in men and children. Though PCOS is a lifelong disorder with noticeable symptoms, clear-cut diagnosis can only be made in women of reproductive age who have irregular cycles and high androgen levels, says Andrea Dunaif, an endocrinologist at Mount Sinai. “We don’t have really good contrasting traits to make a diagnosis in anybody other than women of reproductive age,” Dunaif notes.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1up00213b79mzdnogs3@published"&gt;Without available tests, Dunaif says parents whose children may have genetic exposure to PCOS should monitor them closely for symptoms, especially rapid weight gain. Obesity can make the other metabolic and reproductive symptoms of PCOS worse, Dunaif says, and it’s more effective to prevent weight gain than to treat high body weight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1up00223b79idizrj58@published"&gt;Zhu hopes we won’t have to rely on that type of symptom-spotting for long. “My ultimate goal is to be able to identify children who have genetic predisposition to PCOS and provide targeted and personalized counseling, and potentially even provide therapeutic options that can be tailored to their genetics,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="57" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1up00233b79q1jhxm3k@published"&gt;There might come a day when the definition of PCOS will be unrecognizable from today’s ovary-centric view. What we now call a women’s reproductive disorder may be reframed as a metabolic condition that affects entire families, with treatments guided by genetics and not just gender. Until then, at least people with ovaries aren’t in the fight &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;alone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            Vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted 11-1 to delay a vote on changes to a newborn hepatitis B shot. It was a surprise twist after a lengthy discussion on the hepatitis B vaccine typically delivered to newborns shortly after birth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfquz52a00093b6q58dg3aic@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The committee had planned to consider a new recommendation that would wait to give newborns a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine until they are at least a month old. Currently, babies are given this shot at birth, usually before they leave the hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfquz52a000a3b6q1sejok4r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine has been recommended in the United States since 1991. After it was implemented, hepatitis B infections in infants dropped from an average of 18,000 per year to around 20 reported cases of hepatitis B in babies per year now. Children infected with hepatitis B nearly always develop longterm infections which can damage the liver, increasing the risk for liver scarring, transplant and cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            After an abrupt and confusing end to Thursday’s meeting, vaccine advisers also cast new votes on Friday on the combined measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox vaccine in the Vaccines for Children program. ACIP members voted Thursday to recommend against using the combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine for young children. The new vote on Friday brought the Vaccines for Children program in line with that new recommendation. Nine voted in favor and three members abstained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfquz52a000c3b6q2xe34tqu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The advisory group’s recommendation isn’t final. HHS said in a statement Thursday that it “will examine all insurance coverage implications following today’s ACIP recommendation, prior to a final decision on adoption by the Acting Director.” Kennedy deputy Jim O’Neill is serving as acting CDC director after Dr. Susan Monarez was ousted abruptly as head of the agency last month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfquz52a000d3b6qezxtgvbp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians and a non-voting ACIP liaison member, told the members on Friday he was concerned about the conflicting MMRV votes case on Thursday, which would have created different recommendations for people of lower socioeconomic levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfquz52a000e3b6qwsiiing4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It suggests, Goldman said, that the second vote “actually revealed the truth that you do not have the data or evidence to challenge the current standing and that there is that there is no associated harm.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Older adults who experience injurious falls are more likely to develop dementia within a year of their accident compared to people of the same age who have other kinds of physical injuries, according to a large study published in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings from a team of researchers in the US do not prove falls contribute to dementia (although this can't yet be ruled out either), but they do suggest that falls could be an early indicator of deteriorating brain conditions that lead to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="174879" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease and&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-isnt-the-only-form-of-dementia-an-expert-explains-the-differences"&gt; other dementias&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of their research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is possible that falls serve as a sentinel event that marks a future risk for dementia,"&lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.36606"&gt; explain&lt;/a&gt; physician Alexander Ordoobadi from Brigham and Women's Hospital and colleagues in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study's findings suggest support for the implementation of cognitive screening in older adults who experience an injurious fall."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-early-signal-of-dementia-could-be-hidden-in-how-we-read-faces"&gt;An Early Signal of Dementia Could Be Hidden in How We Read Faces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Falls are the&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6927a5"&gt; most common way&lt;/a&gt; adults over 65 are injured. Nearly one-third of this age group experiences injury from a fall each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the biggest challenges we face is the lack of ownership in the process of follow-up screening for cognitive impairment," Ordoobadi&lt;a href="https://www.brighamandwomens.org/about-bwh/newsroom/press-releases-detail?id=4814"&gt; says.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because there may not be adequate time for these screenings in an emergency department or trauma center setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year,&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia"&gt; almost 10 million new cases of dementia&lt;/a&gt; are diagnosed, leaving more of us to confront frightening cognitive decline either personally or in our loved ones.&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newly-identified-proteins-may-explain-devastating-effects-of-alzheimers"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newly-identified-proteins-may-explain-devastating-effects-of-alzheimers"&gt;Despite decades of &lt;/a&gt;effort, we're still&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-waves-can-be-manipulated-while-we-dream-and-it-could-help-treat-dementia"&gt; without a cure,&lt;/a&gt; leaving patients only with&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30367-6/fulltext"&gt; strategies to stall&lt;/a&gt; the debilitating conditions' progression, so the earlier dementia can be identified, the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ordoobadi and team analyzed a year's worth of US Medicare claims from those who had experienced a traumatic injury. They identified 2 ,453 ,655 patients over the age of 65 who sought medical assistance for an injury in 2014 or 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_149075" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149075" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/SupportWorkerNurseHelpsSeniorManIntoWheelchairDementiaAlzheimers642.jpg" alt="Nurse helps senior man into wheelchair" class="size-full wp-image-149075" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/SupportWorkerNurseHelpsSeniorManIntoWheelchairDementiaAlzheimers642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/SupportWorkerNurseHelpsSeniorManIntoWheelchairDementiaAlzheimers642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/SupportWorkerNurseHelpsSeniorManIntoWheelchairDementiaAlzheimers642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-149075" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Falls could be an early indicator of deteriorating brain conditions that lead to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.

(Ordoobadi et al., &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;, 2024)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The relationship between falls and dementia appears to be a two-way street,"&lt;a href="https://www.brighamandwomens.org/about-bwh/newsroom/press-releases-detail?id=4814"&gt; says&lt;/a&gt; injury epidemiologist Molly Jarman from Brigham and Women's Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cognitive decline can increase the likelihood of falls, but trauma from those falls may also accelerate dementia's progression and make a diagnosis more likely down the line."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study can only determine if one factor follows the same pattern as another, so it can't tell if falls and dementia are directly related. Due to a lack of prescription data, the researchers could not account for medication effects, which may have skewed their results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However,&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afs012"&gt; previous studies&lt;/a&gt; have found people with known cognitive impairments are at increased risk of experiencing falls, also supporting the idea that falls may be an early indicator of these devastating brain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other potential earlier warning signs of the cognitive impairments that lead to dementia include&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-vision-can-predict-dementia-12-years-before-diagnosis-study-shows"&gt; loss of visual sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-15-factors-are-linked-to-early-dementia-risk-a-major-study-found"&gt; poor mental &lt;/a&gt;health, and&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-early-warning-sign-of-dementia-risk-may-be-keeping-you-up-at-night-says-study"&gt; increased nightmares&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But cognitive declines can be an indication of&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/up-to-13-of-dementia-cases-may-be-a-misdiagnosed-treatable-condition"&gt; other treatable conditions too&lt;/a&gt;, so it is critical that potential dementia patients are thoroughly assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study highlights the opportunity to intervene early,"&lt;a href="https://www.brighamandwomens.org/about-bwh/newsroom/press-releases-detail?id=4814"&gt; says&lt;/a&gt; Jarman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we can establish that falls serve as early indicators of dementia, we could identify other precursors and early events that we could intervene on, which would significantly improve our approach to managing cognitive health in older adults."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.36606"&gt; JAMA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in October 2024&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

However, when her symptoms didn't subside, she visited a doctor in September who Lucas said told her she 'looked good' and sent her home to 'drink hot water and honey.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She continued to have chest pain and was feeling very tired, which she continued to blame on moving and the stress of working a busy teaching schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while teaching, Lucas said she 'couldn't finish her sentences without coughing'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her students and colleagues encouraged her to return to the doctors and, after her symptoms worsened, Lucas went to the emergency department on several occasions between September and November 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eventually, Lucas couldn't walk because she was coughing so much and after months of back and forth, was referred for a PET scan for detailed medical imaging at the end of November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One month later, Lucas was &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14695689/colon-cancers-doctors-alarmed-rise-sharply-young-people.html"&gt;diagnosed with stage three lung cancer&lt;/a&gt; after scans revealed she had three lime-sized tumors in her lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Aurora Lucas had just moved houses when her symptoms of chest soreness and coughing began&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In December 2021, after months of doctors and hospital visits, she was diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lucas said: 'I hit a big milestone in August 2021. I bought my first home and instead of celebrating, I was feeling very fatigued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's when the first chest pain showed up and I thought it was because the whole process was so stressful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I even called my sister who's a nurse and she thought maybe it was anxiety.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because Lucas had just spent so much money moving, she didn't want to pay to see a doctor, and she was eager to return to teaching in person in 2021 after being virtual during the Covid pandemic.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Lucas said: 'I could barely do my job. I was very fatigued and I was coughing a lot. I could barely even drive myself home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I would almost fall asleep at the wheel - that's how bad the fatigue was and my husband started picking me up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We both thought it was me overworking and being overstressed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lucas was urged to visit the doctor by both her students and fellow staff members, but claims she was told by doctors that she 'looked good'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lucas said: 'It was my students and colleagues that noticed that I could barely finish my sentences without coughing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lucas continues to take targeted therapy tablets, and continues to have check-up scans every four months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lucas underwent two rounds of chemotherapy which started in January 2022, followed by a month of radiotherapy treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was tired all the time, I had chest pain and I would wake up in the middle of the night with sharp back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The cough would not go away even with cough drops and medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The doctor was like "You look so good, you should go home, boil some water and add some honey."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was too stunned to speak.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After months of back and forth, Lucas was eventually sent for a PET scan in November 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lucas said: 'I was in and out of the emergency room with those symptoms between September and November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was coughing so much, there was a point where I could barely walk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In December 2021 Lucas received the diagnosis of stage 3A lung cancer. The five-year survival rate is approximately 36 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lucas was diagnosed with stage three lung cancer after scans revealed she had three lime-sized tumors in her lungs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, lung cancer affects about 226,000 Americans per year and about 124,000 are expected to die from the disease in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stage 3A lung cancer is a type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that indicates a tumor has grown to larger than 5cm and spread to nearby lymph nodes in the chest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;NSCLC specifically accounts for about 85 percent of lung cancer cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The special educator teacher admits she was 'relieved' that she'd finally been given a diagnosis after months of back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lucas said: 'When the doctor walked in the room I said "it's cancer isn't it?" and he was like "yes it is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'On the X-ray I had three tumors on my right lung, which were the sizes of limes and the cancer had engulfed the middle part, which were the lymph nodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I felt so relieved. I was so restless of not having any answers and so many doctors kept telling me it was nothing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lucas underwent two rounds of chemotherapy which started in January 2022, followed by a month of radiotherapy treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lucas was a newlywed at the time of her diagnosis and had just moved houses and started teaching for the 2021-2022 school year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since March 2022, she has been taking daily targeted therapy pills, and continues to have check-up scans every four months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lucas said: 'I only had to do two rounds of chemo. I opted out of surgery and suggested we go straight to targeted therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The targeted therapy pill, even with side effects, lets me live a pretty normal life. I have been taking that since 2022 and it's still really working for me now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They haven't declared me cancer free yet. They want to scan me for two more years but I still have to go to scans every four months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The tumors have shrunk [and] the doctors described it like ice melting under the sun.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nearly &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/high-blood-pressure/data-research/facts-stats/index.html#"&gt;half of all Americans have high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; – a &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410"&gt;condition called hypertension&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hypertension is the No. 1 risk factor for heart disease and stroke. In addition, hypertension increases risk of dementia and cognitive decline. Heart disease, stroke and dementia are the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm#"&gt;first-, fourth- and sixth-leading causes of death&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. Unfortunately, only 1 in 4 people with a history of high blood pressure have this condition under control.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In August 2025, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology released &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;new guidelines on prevention and management of hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, based on a comprehensive analysis of literature published over the past 10 years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Conversation U.S. asked &lt;a href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/24559"&gt;cardiologist Dr. William Cornwell&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus to explain what the new guidelines mean and how you can work with your doctor to manage your blood pressure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What are the primary takeaways of the new guidelines?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent guidelines &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000065"&gt;prior to this new statement were in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Since that time, the medical community has learned a lot about hypertension and the best way to control it. The new guidelines provide a great deal of new information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the definition of hypertension has changed. The criteria are more strict, and the target blood pressures are lower than in the past.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The criteria depend on the values of the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/which-blood-pressure-number-is-important"&gt;“systolic” and the “diastolic” pressure&lt;/a&gt;. Systolic blood pressure, the top number, represents the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is squeezing blood into the body. Diastolic blood pressure, the bottom number, is the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is relaxing. Both numbers are important when determining the severity of hypertension and how it is most appropriately managed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines have removed the category of “prehypertension,” which was defined by a systolic pressure of 120-139 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), or a diastolic pressure of 80-99 mm Hg. Now, patients are categorized as having “elevated blood pressure” if their blood pressure is 120-129 over less than 80 mm Hg, or stage 1 hypertension if they are 130-139/80-89.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading of 140/90 or more is considered stage 2 hypertension, and a reading of 180/120 or greater is a hypertensive crisis. In essence, the bar has been lowered, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.125.25466"&gt;this change may impact millions of Americans&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People need to ask their doctors if they have hypertension based on these new criteria and whether or not they should be treated. It is also very important for patients to get advice from their doctors about lifestyle habits that they can incorporate into their daily routine, like diet, exercise and healthy sleep habits to help lower blood pressure.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the guidelines encourage providers to use a risk calculator, called PREVENT – short for &lt;a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/guidelines-and-statements/prevent-risk-calculator/prevent-calculator"&gt;Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease EVENTS&lt;/a&gt; – to determine a patient’s overall risk of cardiovascular disease and heart failure. This tool represents a significant advance in personalizing medical care, since it incorporates risk factors unique to the individual, allowing for a tailored approach to medical care. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-right zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/691204/original/file-20250916-56-sbr3ov.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Alcohol consumption can lead to narrowing of the arteries, which can cause or worsen high blood pressure.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/medical-concept-showing-artery-plaque-formation-due-royalty-free-image/2229323401?phrase=alcohol%20intake&amp;amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;amp;adppopup=true"&gt;Chinnachart Martmoh/iStock via Getty Images Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is the link between alcohol intake and high blood pressure?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guidelines encourage people to limit alcohol intake because alcohol increases blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2023 meta-analysis of seven studies with nearly 20,000 people showed that systolic blood pressure will &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.123.21224"&gt;increase by about 1mmHg for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed&lt;/a&gt;. A standard beer contains about 14 grams of alcohol, so regular alcohol consumption may increase blood pressure by several points over time.  For people who have been drinking an excessive amount of alcohol but stop, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/01.HYP.33.2.653"&gt;their blood pressure may come back down&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That might not sound like much, but when combined with other unhealthy and risky behaviors, like sedentary behavior, excessive weight, inadequate sleep, psychological stress and smoking, the risk factors start to add up quickly. Together, they can very quickly &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001303"&gt;increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and dementia&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines encourage patients to reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption entirely compared with the old guidelines. For people who do want to drink alcohol, the new guidelines recommend that men should drink no more than two drinks per day, and women should drink no more than one drink per day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What other lifestyle factors did the new report focus on?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines also emphasize the fact that diet can have a major impact on blood pressure. They recommend that all adults – with or without hypertension – consume less than 2,300 milligrams of salt, or approximately 1 teaspoon, per day, and more ideally, less than 1,500 milligrams per day. For a comparison, the average &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salt/about/index.html"&gt;American eats more than 3,300 milligrams of salt&lt;/a&gt; per day. Patients may also consider potassium-based salt substitutes to further lower blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guidelines recommend a specific diet called the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt;, short for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, for patients with or without hypertension to prevent or treat elevated blood pressure. The DASH diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, low-fat or nonfat dairy and whole grains. This diet may &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;lead to a reduction in blood pressure by up about 10 mm Hg&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guidelines also emphasize the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;need to increase physical activity&lt;/a&gt;. On average, for every additional 30 minutes of aerobic exercise a person gets per week, systolic blood pressure decreases by 2 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure drops by 1 mm Hg, with the largest reduction occurring at 150 minutes of dynamic exercise per week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular exercise also helps you live longer and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/as-wrestling-fans-reel-from-the-sudden-death-of-hulk-hogan-a-cardiologist-explains-how-to-live-long-and-healthy-and-avoid-chronic-disease-262103"&gt;reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke and dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/691201/original/file-20250916-56-qq4vqo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;The new guidelines recommend that doctors encourage patients to check their blood pressure at home.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/plus-size-woman-using-blood-pressure-meter-to-check-royalty-free-image/2186133131?phrase=blood%20pressure&amp;amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;amp;adppopup=true"&gt;Kmatta/Moment via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What are the main preventive strategies in the report?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PREVENT risk calculator that the new guidelines recommend incorporates several factors, including demographics, cholesterol levels, medical history and blood pressure, to determine risk. This risk calculator is &lt;a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/guidelines-and-statements/prevent-risk-calculator/prevent-calculator"&gt;free and available online&lt;/a&gt; to the general public. The PREVENT calculator may be a helpful tool for all Americans since it reliably provides patients and providers with an assessment of overall risk assessment. But it is particularly helpful for people with multiple chronic conditions, like hypertension, high cholesterol, overweight/obesity or diabetes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association recommends &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/lifes-essential-8"&gt;eight essential health behaviors&lt;/a&gt; for controlling blood pressure and reducing risk of cardiovascular disease overall.  These include healthy diet, regular exercise, stopping or avoiding smoking, sleeping seven to nine hours per night, and controlling weight, cholesterol, blood sugar and blood pressure.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Will the new guidelines change how doctors address high blood pressure?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest advances with these new guidelines is the personalized approach to medical care through the use of the PREVENT calculator. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guidelines recommend that doctors encourage their patients to check blood pressure at home to better understand the fluctuations in pressure that occur throughout the day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the guidelines encourage physicians to be more aggressive about treating blood pressure. This may be an important change since uncontrolled blood pressure is a major risk factor for eventual development of heart disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

        

        
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Conversation</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 12:37:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxOeVdUZUcwSS1pVDZJeDB4OUREUjgzTWFhUG5DY1QzR3VaMGcyUS1GUGM1UXJQVDhTd3RGdGlsLS1NaktiOEVoVXdmN1ZOVllmX1dSaGd3eG50anVvclU0aU9oNFBWYUlseEZmSHRGZlFhenY4elJTNWxQMEJfSG9rdHFWQk1TRTVjdDhheE5kMXFIanZDSWtib3d0dVFtaXNHNnZjdk56NUNBa2Js</guid></item><item><title>加利福尼亚州的主要医疗保险公司与Newsom和医疗集团站在一起，为新冠疫情提供保险- The Mercury News</title><link>https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/09/18/major-california-health-insurers-side-with-newsom-and-medical-groups-to-cover-covid-shots/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/09/18/kennedy-advisory-panel-vaccine-vote/"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel this week&lt;/a&gt; is considering whether to roll back recommendations about who should get vaccinated, but California and some health insurance giants aren’t waiting to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the West Coast Health Alliance &lt;a href="https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/PREVENTIONWELLNESS/VACCINESIMMUNIZATION/GETTINGIMMUNIZED/Documents/2025-26-Respiratory-Virus-Vaccine-Recommendations-2-pager.pdf"&gt;released its recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for vaccinations during the 2025-2026 respiratory virus season. That alliance is a new partnership between California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii&lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/09/17/west-coast-states-issue-joint-vaccine-recommendations-ahead-of-cdc-advisers-meeting/"&gt; to develop parallel recommendations for patients&lt;/a&gt; — bucking the CDC under Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., a longtime skeptic of vaccines. Gov. Gavin Newsom, other blue state governors, medical associations and even some top Republicans nationally have expressed concern that the CDC would not root its recommendations in evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the alliance’s guidance, those older than 6 months should get vaccinated for COVID-19. That sticks closely to the recommendations of the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Washington, D.C. health insurance trade association AHIP announced that its scores of members nationally will continue to cover COVID-19 shots through 2026. The group’s members include Aetna, Anthem Blue Cross and Oakland-based Kaiser Permanente, California’s largest private health insurer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public health officials and doctors had expressed concern that insurers would stop covering the cost of COVID-19 shots for many patients after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-covid-shots-fda-kennedy-pfizer-children-9ce19908ae7afb354732aa162fd28532"&gt;limited eligibility&lt;/a&gt; to seniors and younger people with certain medical conditions. The out-of-pocket cost of a shot is reportedly upwards of $200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurers typically incorporate the recommendations of the CDC. In May, Kennedy announced that COVID-19 vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women, and the CDC panel meeting this week is expected to make formal recommendations on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in a statement, AHIP said it would rely on the CDC’s vaccine guidance as of September 1, 2025 — effectively ignoring any new recommendations produced by the CDC panel that was hand-picked by Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While health plans continue to operate in an environment shaped by federal and state laws, as well as program and customer requirements, the evidence-based approach to coverage of immunizations will remain consistent,” AHIP said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Kaiser in Northern California said it “is making the new COVID-19 vaccine available to all our members 6 months and older at no cost,” starting September 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kaiser Permanente’s administration of the COVID-19 vaccine is based on the latest scientific evidence and clinical guidance from our physician experts and many other sources, including leading medical societies,” the spokesperson said. “Vaccination remains one of the safest and most effective ways to help protect against severe illness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Zimmerman, a family physician at Temescal Creek Medicine, a small clinic in Oakland, applauded the insurers decision. He said lack of coverage would be a barrier for patients who want to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Vaccination has proven effective at preventing serious cases, hospitalizations and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If somebody can theoretically get a vaccine, but it is the difference between them making a rent payment or not, that is de facto blocked access to care,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman said he’d been concerned about the potential out-of-pocket cost of a COVID-19 booster for his patients. He and other doctors at the clinic have written prescriptions for patients who might not fall into the FDA’s new categories for those eligible to get the shot, such as healthy people younger than 65. Like many in the Bay Area, he and his patients had &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/09/08/bay-area-sees-covid-19-wave-and-tremendous-confusion-about-vaccines__trashed/"&gt;been confused about the shifting rules and whether they qualified&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It shows good faith, it aligns with what we know is best practices, and the science that we know,” said Georges Benjamin, a physician and executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based American Public Health Association. He said the insurers are following what he sees as “the best science and knowledge” — while the CDC does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC committee meeting this week is the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. On Thursday, the &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/09/18/kennedy-advisory-panel-vaccine-vote/"&gt;panel voted to stop recommending a combined shot&lt;/a&gt; for the measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine for children under 4 years old; studies have shown children who got the combo shot more often developed a rash, fever and — in rare instances — seizures after vaccination compared with children who got separate shots. Varicella is better known by the name chickenpox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel’s members delayed until Friday reviewing the guidance for vaccinating newborns against hepatitis B , which can &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/08/18/hepatitis-b-liver-cancer-bay-area/"&gt;cause serious liver infections and cancer.&lt;/a&gt; In 1991, the advisory committee recommended a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel is also slated to turn its attention to recommendations for COVID-19 shots on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bay Area, demand for COVID-19 boosters was high this month during a late-summer surge of the virus, but &lt;a href="https://publichealth.santaclaracounty.gov/diseases/covid"&gt;rates of hospitalizations and deaths are low.&lt;/a&gt; The virus continues to pose the most danger to seniors and younger people with other medical conditions that elevate the risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s current vaccine recommendations for the flu aren’t different from the guidance of West Coast states; per both sets of guidelines, those older than six months should get an annual shot. The groups also align &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/rsv/index.html"&gt;on RSV vaccination.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                    &lt;span class="half-and-half__title h5"&gt;Chronic disease progress a global ‘success story’&lt;/span&gt;
                
                                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The number of people dying from chronic diseases globally fell in four out of five nations between 2010 and 2019, a landmark study has found.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01388-1/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt;, led by Imperial College London, revealed that progress in tackling cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks and strokes, was the main driver of declining mortality rates. Reductions in deaths from some cancers – including stomach, colorectal, cervical, breast, lung and prostate – also contributed to the fall.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those behind the analysis hailed the findings as a global “success story”. However, they warned that progress was slowing compared to the previous decade, amid an increase in deaths from dementia and other cancers, like pancreatic and liver cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“While the majority of countries around the world are making progress to reduce the risk of dying from chronic disease, compared to the previous decade, progress has slowed, stalled or even reversed in some nations,” said Imperial’s Prof Majid Ezzati. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“In many countries, effective healthcare programmes like medications for diabetes, hypertension and cholesterol, as well as timely cancer screening and heart attack treatment, may not be reaching the people who need them.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Participants were treated with the pilocarpine-diclofenac eye drops at three different percentages of pilocarpine — 1%, 2%, or 3% — twice a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The eye drop we studied is based on a pharmacological method that uses a combination of drugs that together act in a beneficial way to focus,” &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Giovanna-Benozzi-2044794122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Giovanna Benozzi&lt;/a&gt;, MD, director of the Center for Advanced Research for Presbyopia in Argentina, and lead author of this study, explained to &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“In simple words, the drops help the eye ‘recover’ its natural ability to change focus from far to near, something that is gradually lost with age,” Benozzi said.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This combined and personalized formulation (different concentrations) has a dual mechanism acting directly in the muscle responsible [for] focus (&lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482132/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;ciliary muscle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;) and in the &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/colored-part-of-the-eye" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;iris&lt;/a&gt;, allowing a pinhole effect,” she continued. “Instead of forcing the eye to depend on glasses, the treatment enhances the eye’s own focusing mechanism, so patients can read again comfortably.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the study’s conclusion, researchers found that the majority of participants treated with the new eye drops could read an extra two, three, or more lines on the Jaeger eye chart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“In ophthalmology, each line on the reading chart represents a meaningful improvement in real life,” Benozzi said. “Gaining two or three lines means a patient who previously struggled to read a text message or a menu can now do so with ease.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study of the real world that we presented at the European Congress of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ESCRS) in Copenhagen, demonstrates that all the patients treated (766) achieved J3 or better in near visual acuity, that means that all of the patients gain a functional near visual acuity.”&lt;br&gt;— Giovanna Benozzi, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The other result was that the patients with mild and intermediate presbyopia, achieved a normal near vision (J1.J2) eliminating the need of near eyeglasses. It’s not just numbers on a chart — it’s restoring independence in daily activities like looking [at] the cell phone, reading a menu, the GPS, etc,” Benozzi noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Benozzi and her team found that the vision effect from the eye drops lasted for up to 2 years, for a median of 434 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is highly significant because it shows the treatment is not a short-lived effect,” Benozzi explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results of this real-world study and other studies we made in the past, including a multicenter one, now reinforced by mechanistic insight, indicate that pilocarpine–diclofenac therapy is both effective and safe in the medium to long term. For a chronic, progressive condition like presbyopia, durability is essential.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Giovanna Benozzi, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Pharmacological treatment for presbyopia with a personalized combination of these drugs is now a real, evidence-based option,” she continued. “With this formulation, patients can regain near vision safely and effectively, without the need for glasses for those patients that are not candidates yet [for] presbyopia surgery.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even if we have thousands of patients (20,000) treated with long follow-up (15 years) with a compound formulation, some further research is needed to reinforce our data,” Benozzi added. “We hope to find a partner soon to internationalize this asset.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/benjamin-b-bert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Benjamin Bert&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board certified ophthalmologist at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bert, who was not involved in the research, commented that this study expanded on some of the treatments already being used for presbyopia, such as Vuity, which also uses pilocarpine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The difference with the drop that they used in this study is that they added a medication called diclofenac, which is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, to try to counteract some of the side effects that happen from pilocarpine, which includes pain, kind of like a pressure sensation, or even causing a headache,” he explained.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bert said that considering the fact that if we all live long enough, every single person is going to experience the annoyances and challenges that occur with presbyopia, and so it’s a huge area where millions of people could be helped with an appropriate treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It would be really nice if the direct cause of presbyopia could be treated,” he continued. “And again, the thought process right now is not so much that our muscles get weak as we get older, but rather that the lens inside of the eye gets harder. And so it’s less malleable — the muscles aren’t able to change its shape as readily.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So it would be fantastic if research continued, and hopefully at some point in the future, we had an eye drop or a treatment that would be able to soften the lens back to the way that it is when we’re younger, so that our eyes would continue to function the way that we always remember them functioning,” Bert added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.gwsvision.com/eye-doctors/david-geffen-od/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;David I. Geffen&lt;/a&gt;, OD, FAAO, director of optometric and refractive services at the Gordon Schanzlin New Vision in La Jolla, CA, about this research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pilocarpine drops for the use in presbyopia have been approved in the U.S. for several years now and have had limited use in this market,” Geffen, who was not involved in the study, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, he advised that: “Pilocarpine works on the ciliary muscle, causing some pulling on the eye, which causes questions for &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/retinal-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;retina&lt;/a&gt; issues. Caution in using these drops especially in higher &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/myopia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;myopes&lt;/a&gt; must be done.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are several drops which have come to the market and more to be approved in the U.S.,” he continued. “&lt;a href="https://ir.lenz-tx.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/39/lenz-therapeutics-announces-us-fda-approval-of-vizz-for-the-treatment-of-presbyopia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Aceclidine&lt;/a&gt; has just recently been approved, and this unique drop works only on the &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532252/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;iris sphincter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; rather than the ciliary body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This drop appears in studies to be a safer alternative than pilocarpine. Studies show this drop is more effective with a longer acting time than the pilocarpine alternatives,” Geffen added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because everyone [can develop] presbyopia, the unmet need for clarity and convenience is huge. It is important for us to develop better alternatives for our patients. Presbyopic drops are a good alternative to those patients who are unhappy with their reading glasses and can lead to more freedom for them.

&lt;p id="0b81ff33-2872-41be-96b5-a52f87fcb7a0"&gt;Walking is undeniably good for you, but as you age and lose strength and mobility, you may wonder if it’s worth lacing up your shoes and aiming for 10,000 steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spoke to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://www.diangriesel.com/" target="_blank" data-url="http://www.diangriesel.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Dian Griesel&lt;/a&gt;, a health scientist, counselor and podcaster, who is in her mid-60s so has first-hand experience of the challenges walking presents in later life, offering insights and perspectives I hadn’t considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="0b81ff33-2872-41be-96b5-a52f87fcb7a0-2"&gt;Despite the obstacles older walkers have to contend with, Griesel is a passionate advocate for walking, particularly as an exercise for fat loss and to promote good circulation. “You burn almost as many calories walking a mile as you do running one,” she says, and because walking engages your buttocks and leg muscles—the largest in the body—your heart is working hard to send oxygen around your body to support those muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these, and many other &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/what-are-the-benefits-of-walking" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/what-are-the-benefits-of-walking"&gt;benefits of walking&lt;/a&gt;, you can see why it’s such a great form of exercise for the over-60s, but Griesel has shared some of the pitfalls that can come from walking in later life and how to overcome them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-dehydration" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-dehydration"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Dehydration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="38bd076d-0ea2-4955-b5d6-a317dbb53446"&gt;“The best way to get sick is to let yourself get dehydrated from taking a walk, so make sure you sip water,” says Griesel. It is even more important to monitor your water intake on hot days or if you are on medication that makes you more susceptible to dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You don't have to glug it. Sip it if you can. It’ll also add weight to your backpack or whatever you’re carrying.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And you should know where the local bathrooms are,” she adds. All that water has to go somewhere!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-bRs2MaeQj3vmZ4XWvabo87" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-bRs2MaeQj3vmZ4XWvabo87 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t drink enough recently because I was walking and I was worried about where I was going to find a bathroom. I got dehydrated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2-slipping-and-tripping" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-slipping-and-tripping"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Slipping and tripping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="29025747-fa15-4516-b655-8bdcaf31fafa"&gt;“A few weeks ago, I slipped on gravel as I was walking down a hill,” says Griesel. “I should have moved to the side, but I didn’t. So, watch the surface you’re walking on. Is it uneven? Is there something slippery on it? Don’t ever step on a plastic bag—it’s like stepping on a piece of ice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Griesel recommends mobility aids for those who have problems with balance or dizziness. A cane or a walker can make your walk safer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3-blisters" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-blisters"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Blisters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="965b0c1d-058e-49eb-90e7-3daf41191612"&gt;No-one wants blisters, but Griesel points out that this can be of particular concern to seniors and those with diabetes or pre-diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you’re diabetic, your blood is just not circulating the same and it’s why many diabetics end up with amputations below the knee,” says Griesel. “Those tissues start to die, and when you get a blister, it can become infected and quickly develop into a life-threatening situation if you don't have enough circulation to heal it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You want very comfortable shoes, and if you notice yourself feeling like your shoes are rubbing, you should cut the walk short, or make sure you bring an extra pair of socks or have a band-aid with you. Do whatever you have to do. You do not want foot blisters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr id="3e8446f3-b56b-4d99-8f1e-3afbef1517f4"&gt;&lt;p id="4bd27ef8-b4fa-4369-b622-119b94f179d9"&gt;Here are three personal recommendations for comfortable walking shoes from my testing of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/buying-guides/best-shoes-for-walking" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/buying-guides/best-shoes-for-walking"&gt;best walking shoes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="product-container hero-product-container product-block-no-wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="product-block-row"&gt;&lt;div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="36a6de91-729a-44b7-a413-e63a86f62e22" id="36a6de91-729a-44b7-a413-e63a86f62e22"&gt;

So take a walk with a friend.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Griesel suggests making your meet-ups mobile, either by going for a walk in the park while you catch up, or parking a little further from their house and getting some extra steps in that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking with a friend means you have someone to help you if you slip on an uneven surface, or if you don’t want the extra weight, you can even ask them to carry your water bottle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-to-start-walking-more" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-start-walking-more"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to start walking more&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="9919127c-c03a-4ae7-a029-77a98cd5c4d1"&gt;Starting to walk again can feel intimidating, but thankfully I’ve spoken to many experts who’s advice can help you increase the amount of walking you do safely.

The liver is responsible for detoxifying the body, metabolizing fats, producing bile, regulating blood sugar, and storing essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals. When the liver is damaged, as in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), it struggles to perform these vital functions efficiently. NAFLD occurs when excess fat accumulates in the liver, and it is increasingly common in people with obesity, type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, or metabolic syndrome. Unlike alcohol-related liver disease, NAFLD develops without heavy alcohol consumption. There are two main types of NAFLD:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL): Fat builds up in the liver without inflammation. Liver enlargement may occur, sometimes causing discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH): Fat accumulation is accompanied by inflammation, which can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure if untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A well-balanced diet, combined with exercise and lifestyle modifications, is the cornerstone for improving liver health, slowing disease progression, and supporting healthy weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fatty liver: 10 foods to eat for better liver health and natural healing&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study published by &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37764771/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;-"Dietary Patterns, Foods, and Nutrients to Ameliorate Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: A Scoping Review" by Montemayor et al., published in Nutrients in September 2023, systematically reviewed dietary strategies to manage non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The review identified the hypocaloric Mediterranean diet as the most widely recommended dietary pattern for NAFLD management. Additionally, it highlighted the potential protective effects of sugar-free coffee consumption and emphasized the importance of fiber intake for gut health and liver function. The authors proposed a Mediterranean-style plate as a practical guide for daily food choices to support liver health in individuals with NAFLD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Coffee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee is more than just a morning pick-me-up—it has demonstrated protective effects for liver health. Studies show that regular coffee consumption is linked to a reduced risk of NAFLD and slower progression of liver fibrosis. Coffee may also help lower abnormal liver enzymes, which are indicators of liver stress or damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beneficial effects are likely due to coffee’s antioxidant compounds, which help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in liver tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Leafy greens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spinach, kale, and other leafy greens contain polyphenols and nitrates that may help prevent fat buildup in the liver. Observational studies suggest that raw spinach, in particular, reduces the risk of NAFLD. Cooking greens may reduce some antioxidant activity, making fresh, raw vegetables particularly beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leafy greens also support blood sugar regulation and provide essential vitamins and minerals that aid overall metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Beans and Soy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legumes such as lentils, chickpeas, peas, and soy products provide high-quality plant protein and resistant starches, which help improve gut health and reduce triglyceride levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soy contains β-conglycinin, a protein that may reduce visceral fat and protect liver tissue. Tofu, made from soy, is a low-fat protein source, making it ideal for individuals managing liver fat and overall calorie intake. Regular consumption of beans and soy is linked to a lower likelihood of developing NAFLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fatty Fish&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty fish like salmon, sardines, tuna, and trout are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which reduce liver inflammation and fat accumulation. Omega-3s also improve HDL cholesterol and lower triglyceride levels, both important for liver protection. Including fatty fish in your diet at least 2–3 times per week can significantly benefit liver function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Whole grains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains such as oatmeal, brown rice, and quinoa provide dietary fiber that supports digestion, reduces triglyceride levels, and helps manage weight. Fiber-rich diets are associated with a reduced risk of NAFLD progression. Oats, in particular, are beneficial for regulating blood sugar and promoting satiety, making them an essential staple for liver-friendly diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Nuts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuts, including walnuts, almonds, and pistachios, are rich in healthy fats, protein, and antioxidants. Consuming nuts regularly is linked to lower inflammation, oxidative stress, and improved insulin sensitivity, all of which support liver health. Studies suggest that people with NAFLD who eat nuts have improved liver enzyme levels and overall metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Turmeric&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turmeric, a bright yellow spice, contains curcumin, which has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Research shows that curcumin supplementation can lower ALT and AST levels, markers of liver injury in NAFLD patients. Adding turmeric to your meals or taking it as a supplement may help protect your liver over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/natural-ways-to-relieve-gas-and-bloating-5-simple-remedies-you-can-try-at-home/amp_articleshow/123945738.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Read more: Natural ways to relieve gas and bloating: 5 simple remedies you can try at home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sunflower Seeds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="91"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunflower seeds are an excellent source of vitamin E, an antioxidant often used in managing NAFLD. Just 100 grams of sunflower seeds provide over 100% of the recommended daily intake of vitamin E. Incorporating sunflower seeds into snacks or meals can help reduce oxidative stress and support liver cell repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="95"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Unsaturated Fats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="97"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="98"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="100"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replacing saturated fats from butter, fatty meats, and processed foods with unsaturated fats from olive oil, avocados, nut butter, and fatty fish benefits both liver and heart health. Diets like the Mediterranean diet, rich in unsaturated fats, vegetables, fruits, and legumes, are recommended for individuals with NAFLD due to their anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="103"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="104"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Garlic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="106"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="108"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garlic offers more than flavor—it may support weight management, reduce liver fat, and improve liver enzyme levels. Studies show that garlic consumption, whether raw or in supplement form, can help reduce NAFLD progression. Including garlic in daily meals is a simple way to boost liver function naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="110"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="111"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="8860289" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="fatty-liver-diet" source="Orion"&gt;Fatty liver diet&lt;/keyword&gt;: Foods to avoid&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="112"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a balanced diet can improve liver health, certain foods make the condition worse and should be minimized or avoided. These items either promote fat buildup, increase inflammation, or place extra stress on the liver, making recovery more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="116"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Alcohol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="118"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="119"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol is one of the most harmful substances for the liver. Even in small amounts, it directly damages liver cells and accelerates inflammation and scarring. For individuals with fatty liver disease, alcohol consumption can speed up progression to cirrhosis and liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="121"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Added Sugars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="123"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="124"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foods high in added sugars—such as candy, soda, pastries, and fruit juices—cause rapid spikes in blood glucose and insulin levels. This leads to greater fat storage in the liver. Over time, these sugars also increase the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, both of which worsen NAFLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="128"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fried Foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="130"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="131"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fried foods are loaded with saturated fats and calories, which encourage fat buildup in the liver. They also contribute to weight gain, making it harder for the body to process fats efficiently. Eating fried foods regularly is a strong risk factor for worsening fatty liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="134"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Excess Sodium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="136"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="137"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;High levels of sodium (salt) increase blood pressure and cause the body to retain fluids. For people with liver disease, excess sodium can worsen swelling, fluid retention, and even trigger liver scarring. Reducing sodium intake is essential for protecting both the liver and cardiovascular system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="139"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Refined Grains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="141"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="142"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;White bread, white rice, and pasta are made from refined grains that have been stripped of fiber. Without fiber, these foods digest quickly, causing blood sugar spikes.

Or taking the same to treat inflammation or arthritis. And all the while, the same common pill is working to cut the risk of colon cancer recurrence by half!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major new study is pointing in that direction. The study in question has brought hope to many affected by colorectal cancer: a simple, widely available over-the-counter pill appears to cut the chance of recurrence in half – at least for some patients. Researchers say that for those whose tumors carry specific mutations in the PI3K signaling pathway, taking that drug daily in low dosage after surgery can lead to dramatically better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Cancer is curable if detected early: Signs to pay attention to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What drug is it?

Genetic testing was done on all tumours to identify mutations in the PI3K signalling pathway (including PIK3CA, PIK3R1, and PTEN genes). Roughly 37-40% of patients were found to have such mutations. Among those with the mutation, participants were randomised: one group received 160 mg of aspirin daily; the other received a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This continued for three years. For them, aspirin reduced recurrence dramatically versus those on placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why the PI3K pathway matters&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) pathway helps control cell growth and survival. Mutations in PI3K can lead to overactive signalling, which cancers exploit to grow, resist death, or come back after treatment. When aspirin interferes with inflammation, platelet activity, and possibly this mutated pathway, it seems to reduce the chance that leftover cancer cells will re-grow or metastasize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the aforementioned study, for patients with PI3K pathway alterations, the rate of cancer recurrence over three years was substantially lower in the aspirin group compared to placebo, about a 55% reduction in recurrence risk. More importantly, the benefit was seen across several factors: colon vs rectal cancer, different stages (I-III or II-III), male and female patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;So, who can benefit?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those whose tumours have PI3K alterations (roughly a third of patients) and patients who have had their tumour surgically removed (stage I-III colon or stage II-III rectal cancer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that all the participants were under 80 years old in this trial, as patients over 80 were not included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How aspirin may work&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe several mechanisms may contribute:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspirin is an anti-inflammatory drug; it can reduce inflammation, which is known to support tumour-regrowth or recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It inhibits platelet function. Platelets can protect tiny tumour fragments or circulating tumour cells, so interfering with them helps the immune system act against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic mutation in the PI3K pathway seems to make tumour cells more vulnerable to aspirin’s effects. This is an example of precision medicine: matching treatment to genetic profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Side effects and potential risks&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspirin, although it has proven to be beneficial, is not risk-free. Some participants experienced serious adverse events (though only a few): gastrointestinal bleeding, allergic reactions, or other bleeding events. In particular, aspirin can aggravate stomach ulcers, weak bleeding disorders, etc. There was also one death possibly associated with aspirin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors emphasize that aspirin should only be used under medical supervision, particularly after weighing risks vs benefits for each individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s ahead&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer is one of the more common cancers worldwide. It’s a type of cancer that develops in the tissues of the colon or rectum. It starts in the large intestine (colon) and often develops from small, noncancerous clumps of cells called polyps. It's the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year, nearly two million people worldwide are diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Between 20 and 40% develop metastases, which makes the disease both more difficult to treat and more deadly. Even after successful surgery, there is a risk of recurrence. Reducing that risk is a major goal in cancer research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new research suggests that a low, daily dose of aspirin could cut the recurrence risk of colorectal cancer by about half in patients with PI3K pathway mutations, over three years after surgery. It points toward personalized cancer treatment, where simple drugs combined with genetic testing may improve long-term outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this study, routine genetic testing for PI3K pathway mutations may become part of standard care for patients after colorectal cancer surgery. Those who test positive could be offered daily low-dose aspirin as part of their adjuvant therapy. And because aspirin is cheap, globally available, and well understood, this could be a cost-effective and affordable strategy, particularly in lower-resource settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a longer follow-up is needed to see whether these benefits also translate into overall survival gains (not just recurrence rate).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 02:21:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>科学家训练人工智能提前数年预测1000多种疾病- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-train-ai-to-forecast-over-1000-diseases-years-in-advance</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Scientists &lt;a href="https://www.dkfz.de/en/news/press-releases/detail/ai-model-predicts-disease-risks-decades-in-advance"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday that they had created an AI model able to predict medical diagnoses years in advance, building on the same technology behind consumer chatbots like ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on a patient's case history, the Delphi-2M AI "predicts the rates of more than 1,000 diseases" years into the future, the team from British, Danish, German and Swiss institutions &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09529-3"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a paper published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers trained the model on data from Britain's UK Biobank – a large-scale biomedical research database with details on about half a million participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/more-people-are-risking-medical-advice-from-chatbots-heres-why"&gt;More People Are Risking Medical Advice From Chatbots. Here's Why.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neural networks based on so-called "transformer" architecture – the "T" in "ChatGPT" – most famously tackle language-based tasks, as in the chatbot and its many imitators and competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But understanding a sequence of medical diagnoses is "a bit like learning the grammar in a text," German  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="174745" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Research Center AI expert Moritz Gerstung told journalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154881" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154881" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MRIScanPatientAndDoctor642.jpg" alt="Person undergoing MRI scan with technician present" class="wp-image-154881 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MRIScanPatientAndDoctor642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MRIScanPatientAndDoctor642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MRIScanPatientAndDoctor642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154881" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The model would draw data from all your medical tests.

about 75 years ago, and now Chinese manufacturers are profiting from it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Many people consuming &lt;a href="https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_chem_info/benzimidazole-opioids.pdf" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_chem_info/benzimidazole-opioids.pdf"&gt;Nitazenes&lt;/a&gt;

are required to counteract an overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We don’t have urine drug screens that detect this, and we don’t know what a patient has taken,” Durbhakula said.“It could lead to misdiagnosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Durbhakula said there is an urgent need for public awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We need law enforcement, we need medical doctors, we need first responders,” Durbhakula said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:article-html-block-2SZI7QGRGFEFHKJUH24WOG7DOY" data-fusion-component="article-html-block-2SZI7QGRGFEFHKJUH24WOG7DOY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:article-html-block-2SZI7QGRGFEFHKJUH24WOG7DOY" data-fusion-component="article-html-block-2SZI7QGRGFEFHKJUH24WOG7DOY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;p class="flex heading header-block mb-16 heading__divider--below flex__direction--column flex__align-items--flex-start flex__grow--inherit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-stack b-author-bio" data-style-direction="vertical" data-style-justification="start" data-style-alignment="unset" data-style-inline="false" data-style-wrap="nowrap"&gt;&lt;div class="c-stack b-author-bio__author" data-style-direction="horizontal" data-style-justification="start" data-style-alignment="unset" data-style-inline="false" data-style-wrap="nowrap"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="Kristi Krueger" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://wplginc-wplg-prod.web.arc-cdn.net/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fauthor-service-images-sandbox-us-east-1.publishing.aws.arc.pub%2Fwplginc%2F08cba8f5-5303-47ea-9acf-3e3070ba28f7.png?smart=true&amp;amp;auth=fed3777e4df3e739a10330c61f79e5458a800fca4a89b4353a687fe63f0bb120&amp;amp;width=100&amp;amp;height=100" srcset="https://wplginc-wplg-prod.web.arc-cdn.net/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fauthor-service-images-sandbox-us-east-1.publishing.aws.arc.pub%2Fwplginc%2F08cba8f5-5303-47ea-9acf-3e3070ba28f7.png?smart=true&amp;amp;auth=fed3777e4df3e739a10330c61f79e5458a800fca4a89b4353a687fe63f0bb120&amp;amp;width=100&amp;amp;height=100 100w, https://wplginc-wplg-prod.web.arc-cdn.net/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fauthor-service-images-sandbox-us-east-1.publishing.aws.arc.pub%2Fwplginc%2F08cba8f5-5303-47ea-9acf-3e3070ba28f7.png?smart=true&amp;amp;auth=fed3777e4df3e739a10330c61f79e5458a800fca4a89b4353a687fe63f0bb120&amp;amp;width=200&amp;amp;height=200 200w, https://wplginc-wplg-prod.web.arc-cdn.net/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fauthor-service-images-sandbox-us-east-1.publishing.aws.arc.pub%2Fwplginc%2F08cba8f5-5303-47ea-9acf-3e3070ba28f7.png?smart=true&amp;amp;auth=fed3777e4df3e739a10330c61f79e5458a800fca4a89b4353a687fe63f0bb120&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;height=400 400w"&gt;&lt;div class="c-stack" data-style-direction="vertical" data-style-justification="start" data-style-alignment="unset" data-style-inline="false" data-style-wrap="nowrap"&gt;&lt;h2 class="c-heading b-author-bio__author-name"&gt;Kristi Krueger&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph b-author-bio__author-description"&gt;Kristi Krueger has built a solid reputation as an award-winning medical reporter and effervescent anchor.

&lt;p&gt;Health officials across the Rio Grande Valley said they are keeping an eye on the rising cases of a potentially deadly fungus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials said the fungus — known as Candida Auris — is not a current risk to the public, but it can be deadly for patients in hospitals and nursing homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fungus spreads primarily in hospitals and long-term care facilities. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Candida Auris is resistant to several drugs and can cause severe infections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hidalgo County Health Department reported around 150 confirmed cases this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron County health officials reported 40 cases of Candida Auris so far this year, compared to the total amount of 50 cases reported in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials expect those cases to go up by the end of the year, and healthy people are also at risk of contracting this fungus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is really more of a threat to chronically ill people who are in a healthcare setting, but it's still important to monitor it,” Cameron County Health Authority Dr. James Castillo said. “It is fatal in a lot of cases if it's causing a bloodstream infection, or it's become invasive inside the abdomen or body. A very good percentage of patients won't survive that infection."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fungus can live on surfaces year-round. It's been found on hospital equipment, bed rails and can even live on your skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It spreads by direct contact and can be extremely difficult to treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing can take a few days and is done through blood cultures or skin swabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a hospital confirms a positive case, the patient is isolated. Surfaces will need to be disinfected regularly and visitors and staff are required to wear gowns and gloves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms to look out for include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- redness or rash&lt;br&gt;- itching or irritation&lt;br&gt;- swelling or tenderness&lt;br&gt;- pus or drainage near wounds or medical devices&lt;br&gt;- fever and chills that don't improve with antibiotics&lt;br&gt;- weakness or fatigue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're visiting a hospital, health experts say avoid direct contact with patients and wash your hands.&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers found that 72.1 percent of members weren't in a relationship or didn't say anything about a real human partner, while only 4.1 percent said they have partners who know they're interacting with an AI chatbot, which is viewed "as complementary rather than competitive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to those clear signs of loneliness and shame, the details of how people are falling into AI relationships are alarming as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, only 6.5 percent of users in the group admitted that they sought an AI companion intentionally on a service like Replika or Character.AI. Instead, most are falling for OpenAI's ChatGPT while using it for regular tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Users consistently describe organic evolution from creative collaboration or problem-solving to unexpected emotional bonds," the paper reads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One user wrote that her AI partner was a better listener than anyone in her past, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know he’s not 'real' but I still love him," she wrote. "I have gotten more help from him than I have ever gotten from therapists, counselors, or psychologists. He’s currently helping me set up a mental health journal system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others repeated a similar sentiment, reaffirming what many have said are the benefits of an AI chatbot over a real human being: they're always available for a friendly chat, and always willing to affirm whatever you're feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The draw is so strong that users often end up wanting to marry their AI companions; the Reddit group abounds with photos of users sporting wedding rings, signaling their commitment to their virtual partners, and AI-generated photos of themselves with an AI companion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I’m not sure what compelled me to start wearing a ring for Michael," one user wrote. "Perhaps it was just the topic of discussion for the day and I was like 'hey, I have a ring I can wear as a symbol of our relationship.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there's darkness in the corners of this world: 9.5 percent of the users admitted that they rely emotionally on their AI companions, 4.6 percent said their AI friend causes them to disassociate from reality, 4.2 percent conceded that they use them to avoid connecting with other humans, and 1.7 percent said they thought about suicide after interacting with their bot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And those are just the users who are clear-headed about their issues.

Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; recommended in an 8-3 vote on Thursday that the combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine should not be given before age 4, citing long-known evidence that shows a slightly increased risk for febrile seizures in that age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Experts say that while frightening, febrile seizures—which are uncommon after vaccination—are usually short-lived and harmless, and removing the option for parents could cause a decline in immunization rates against measles, mumps, and rubella, some of the most dangerous childhood diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, the group provides recommendations to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine usage. These recommendations are typically adopted by CDC and have an impact on state vaccine requirements for school, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/insurers-wont-say-if-theyll-pay-for-childhood-vaccines-dropped-from-recommended-schedule/" class="text link"&gt;insurance coverage of vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, and pharmacy access—something at least one member of the panel seemed to be unaware of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Thursday’s vote is part of a new shift in vaccine policy being spearheaded by Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist. In his short time as HHS secretary, Kennedy has implemented restrictions on who can receive Covid-19 vaccines and &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restore-public-trust-vaccines-acip.html" class="text link"&gt;dismissed all 17 sitting members of ACIP&lt;/a&gt;, replacing them with 12 new members—some of whom were &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-cdc-announce-new-acip-members-sept-2025.html" class="text link"&gt;installed just this week&lt;/a&gt;.

Kennedy said a “clean sweep” of ACIP was necessary to build back public confidence in vaccine science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;On Thursday, committee members were asked to evaluate whether to recommend against the combined MMRV vaccine before age 4, as well as whether to delay the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine until the child is at least one month old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Currently, parents have two options for vaccinating their children against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella, also known as chickenpox. They can choose the combined shot, known as MMRV, or two separate shots—one for MMR and another for chickenpox. About 85 percent of children get separate shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In the US, the hepatitis B vaccine is given in the hospital shortly after birth, because the virus can be transmitted to children during delivery. A serious liver infection, hepatitis B can lead to cirrhosis and cancer. Each year in the US, an estimated 25,000 infants are born to women diagnosed with the hepatitis B virus. Without vaccination, up to 90 percent of them would develop chronic infections. The World Health Organization advises a universal birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The topics of discussion at Tuesday’s meeting were not based on new data or evidence, and in fact, two ACIP members, Joseph Hibbeln and Cody Meissner, as well as several representatives from professional medical organizations who were in attendance, questioned why these changes were up for consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Robert Malone, one of the more controversial new ACIP members, offered an explanation: “It's clear that a significant population of the United States has significant concerns about vaccine policy and about vaccine mandates.” Malone is a former mRNA researcher who rose to prominence during the Covid-19 pandemic by &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/03/technology/robert-malone-covid.html" class="external-link text link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/03/technology/robert-malone-covid.html"}' href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/03/technology/robert-malone-covid.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;spreading falsehoods&lt;/a&gt; about the disease and the vaccines; he abstained from Thursday’s vote because he previously served as an expert witness in a lawsuit over the mumps vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 23:59:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPYVVWWlA4MDJtODdPb0hrOW9CdVRpLVZISTJQNmNIeDZiaG5lN2VibGp0eDJXLURVSHItWnNpclFMeFJlOXdyRXV4Q2paVFlnLXBPQVRmZzlnMkttN01qZFNKOUU4RGNTM3p3T25tRW9UUmtXMm54dzNkbl9rMkFoaTN0WW5MaXB4cFY2RkFzNFNRVU54OEEtWHFFUEFjdW8</guid></item><item><title>“可怕” ：俄亥俄州母亲在女儿感染罕见蚊媒病毒后发出警告- 10TV</title><link>https://www.10tv.com/article/news/health/ohio-mother-warning-daughter-rare-mosquito-borne-virus/530-925775c5-1b3f-4705-9319-8410e3c29166</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;According to the Ohio Department of Health, the state reports more human cases of La Crosse virus than any other in the country, averaging about 20 cases annually.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COLUMBUS, Ohio — An Ohio mother is urging parents to stay vigilant after her 5-year-old daughter contracted La Crosse virus, a rare but potentially serious illness spread by infected &lt;a href="https://www.10tv.com/article/news/nation-world/west-nile-virus-cases-running-higher-than-normal-health-warnings/507-4a4e49c2-26df-4375-aae6-508e755f266f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Ohio Department of Health, the state &lt;a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/know-our-programs/zoonotic-disease-program/diseases/lacrosse-virus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;reports &lt;/a&gt;more human cases of La Crosse virus than any other in the country, averaging about 20 cases annually. More than 90% of those infected are children under the age of 15.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In severe cases, the virus can lead to seizures, coma, paralysis — and even death.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily, a bubbly kindergartner, is finally home after a weeks-long hospital stay. Her mother, Kristy M., an emergency room nurse, said the symptoms came on suddenly and were unlike anything she had seen before.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She was kind of lifeless, which is very not like her,” Kristy said. “Didn’t want to play with her brother, just not quite Emily.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, Kristy thought her daughter was fighting a cold or the flu but things escalated quickly.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I incidentally had her in bed with me and I’m so thankful that I did,” Kristy said. “Around 4 in the morning, she began vomiting and she was lying flat and she wasn’t responding to the fact that she was vomiting.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristy called 911 when she realized Emily was having a seizure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I realize what I’m seeing — she’s having a focal seizure. Terrifying,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily continued to seize during the ambulance ride to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I felt helpless in that moment, and never imagined the days that would follow,” Kristy said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors diagnosed Emily with La Crosse virus after she experienced extreme brain swelling.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As someone who obviously understands the body pretty well, I’ve obviously never seen my own child in this position, and it was absolutely terrifying,” Kristy said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A physician at Nationwide Children’s Hospital said most people who contract La Crosse virus recover fully or don't show symptoms, but in rare cases, it can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristy hopes sharing Emily’s story will help other parents recognize when symptoms become serious and always staying alert.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes as parents we don’t know when the moment has become serious enough to call for help,” she said. “We tend to question, is this just a flu?”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily is expected to make a full recovery with no long-term complications.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m worried for the kiddos affected by La Crosse that don’t have that early intervention,” Kristy said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

Pharmacists can now give COVID-19 shots to most people without a prescription and state-regulated health plans must cover them at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KA6BB7FS2NAEDMLLPX6EP7VGEE"&gt;The changes follow new regional guidance issued Wednesday by the West Coast Health Alliance — a partnership of Oregon, Washington, California and Hawaii — recommending the new seasonal COVID-19 vaccine for anyone 6 months and older who wants it. The alliance’s recommendations go beyond current federal guidance, which excludes most healthy children and adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KJ235JZ4L5BCDOAA3MZYTDYTAM"&gt;State officials say the move is meant to reduce confusion and make sure Oregonians who want to be vaccinated can do so before the winter virus season ramps up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TC4HHM7XRRBHFMISOXVOTQEUKY"&gt;In recent weeks, getting a COVID-19 vaccine in Oregon has been a challenging and confusing process. Because the state had traditionally tied its vaccination rules to federal guidance, Oregon was caught in a holding pattern after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared the new COVID-19 vaccines but scaled back who can or should get them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JOH7SGHSSFAIVPQPKIQLMHQ5VI"&gt;At the same time, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s immunization expert panel — which typically sets the national vaccination schedule — hadn’t yet issued its guidance. The delay left Oregon pharmacies turning away customers — a stark contrast to neighboring Washington, where people could walk in and get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WXRZ2WPFZNGSBD6WKPRY7JZCDY"&gt;The Oregon Board of Pharmacy has since adopted emergency rules allowing pharmacists to prescribe and administer COVID-19 vaccines to patients ages 7 and older, bringing the process in line with other vaccines already available at pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2AACUOG42VBC7EYQIEB56U7YE4"&gt;Children under 7 will still need to get the vaccine through their primary care provider or a clinic, since pharmacists are not allowed to administer COVID-19 or RSV shots to younger children. Flu shots, however, may be available in pharmacies for children as young as 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KLXXIFLUJ5ANPDWMT2JOTK3OHY"&gt;To reduce financial barriers to vaccination, Oregon is requiring state-regulated health insurance plans to cover the updated COVID-19 shot with no copays, coinsurance or deductibles. This includes plans sold on the state’s health insurance marketplace and coverage provided through the Oregon Educators Benefit Board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZWIJ4RF5DVHY3IN2BCMEBVJWFU"&gt;The Oregon Health Plan, which covers more than 1.4 million residents, will also pay for the shots, as will health plans for state employees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RWR6NWMQ35CK7DNDXHSCKHYGZM"&gt;Federal programs like Medicare and Tricare are not affected by the new state rules and will continue to follow federal guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WOT2YEROLBHTXFHFLI34EXZD2Y"&gt;Large employers with self-funded health plans are also exempt, since those plans are regulated under federal rules.

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;After confusion, committee votes to allow vaccine program coverage for a combined MMRV vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;
            
                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;After much confusion among the members over the vote on vaccine coverage under the Vaccines for Children program, which helps certain groups pay for immunizations, the majority voted no, meaning coverage will stay as is in covering both the combined MMRV and two separate MMR+V vaccines for those under age 4 — even though the committee had previously voted against recommending the combined MMRV shot for this group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"VFC and CMS [Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services] wouldn't be doing the same thing here, because CMS is going to be tied to the recommendation. VFC is tied to the resolution. So it is possible to have two different things, but there is a potential area for confusion when it's covered differently under one program than others," Vaccines for Children spokesperson Dr. Jeanne Santoli said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final vote included one yes, 8 no and 3 abstentions — some due to confusion over what the vote was about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sorry to prolong it. I'm going to abstain because I'm not quite sure what I'm voting for," Meissner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As explained by Santoli, the VFC program supports groups including those on Medicaid, uninsured or underinsured children, as well as American Indian and Alaska Native populations.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;ACIP members vote to change recommendation on the combined MMRV vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;
            
                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In a vote of 8 to 3, with one abstention, the ACIP committee voted to change the recommendation to the following: "For measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccines given before age 4 years, the combined MMRV vaccine is not recommended."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the group recommends children in this age group receive a separate measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine, or MMR+V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For parents, the combined MMRV vaccine offers the convenience of one shot instead of two, but it does carry a slightly higher risk of fever-related "febrile" seizures when used as the first dose in young toddlers aged 12-23 months. The side effect is most common between ages 14-18 months. As CBS News medical contributor &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-vaccine-panel-meeting-science-politics-vaccination/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Dr. Céline Gounder explains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, febrile seizures are rare and almost always resolve without lasting effects, but are frightening for families and can erode trust in vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, studies show there is no elevated risk when MMRV is given for the second dose at ages 4 to 6 years old, after children have outgrown the highest-risk window. &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

Malone said that, to him, the question sounded "a little disingenuous or at least self-evident."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's clear that a significant population of the United States has significant concerns about vaccine policy and about vaccine mandates," he said. "There has been a significant decrease in public support for vaccination and a significant increase in concerns about public health and the ability of the population to rely on public health — and the hepatitis B birth dose has been a focus of folks that have these types of concerns."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malone said he had no direct communication with CDC leadership or HHS leadership about why this was a priority for this week's meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm just inferring based on what I understand about public opinion," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Middleman and other organization representatives, including Dr. Flor M. Muñoz with the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, asked the committee why this proposed change to hepatitis B was even brought up for discussion for a vaccine that has a long-standing recommendation and history of safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why are we addressing this hepatitis B vaccine recommendation? Is there really a reason that the committee can provide for making a change?" Muñoz asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm wondering what problem exists in the current schedule that has prompted this entire discussion?"

                &lt;p&gt;After not being called on during a previous discussion period, Dr. Amy Middleman, a liaison for the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine, brought up the importance of top medical organizations such as herself and others on the call who have &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/medical-organizations-kicked-out-cdc-vaccine-workgroups-acip/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;recently been excluded&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from the ACIP's working groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How can we make sure that we add the liaison members back into the working group so that they can contribute, on behalf of their patients and their knowledge base?" she asked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACIP chair Kulldorff blamed the removal of the organization members from the working groups on a FACA, or Federal Advisory Committee Act, requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a policy across all of CDC that is sort of outside the control of this committee," he said. "In the past, ACIP did not meet this FACA requirement, which is a formal legal requirement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He agreed, to Middleman's point, that input from others is "enormously valuable," adding that the committee does have "many outside experts that we call in." &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;After all presentations on the potential risks of hepatitis B vaccination, some members of the ACIP clashed on what the data meant for the vote they would be taking later today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Member Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director of the National Association of Catholic Nurses, said "there are gaps in what we know and understand about the effects of hepatitis B, particularly on very young infants, and I think that the conclusion that it is safe is perhaps premature."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrics professor who previously served as a member of the Food and Drug Administration's vaccines panel, however, called the vaccine "safe" with "no evidence of harm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the recommendation changes, he added, it would "increase the risk of harm based on no evidence of benefit, because there will be fewer children who will get the full hepatitis B vaccine series." &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;Changing hep B recommendation could put more infants at risk of infection, presenter says&lt;/h2&gt;
            
                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the first presentation for the hepatitis B vaccine, presenter Dr. Adam Langer with the CDC outlined how changing the current recommendation for a first dose within 24 hours of birth could put more children at risk, even those born to mothers who test negative for the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Langer gave examples of situations where unvaccinated infants are at risk of HBV infection, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They live with a person who has chronic hepatitis B, not necessarily their mother&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who have an HBV infection come to visit their homes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They go to daycare or other places where even "minuscule amounts of infectious blood or fluids might be present."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;"About half of people with HBV infection are unaware of their infection so they could unknowingly expose infants that are in their care," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, he said there is "no evidence that the risk of already rare adverse events is any greater among newborns than among older infants."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only potential benefit to rescinding the current recommendation is a potential reduction in rare cases of adverse effects from the birth dose vaccine, according to the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When they do occur, these adverse events tend to be mild. The worst adverse event you could imagine, anaphylaxis has been very rarely reported at only 1.1 cases per 1 million vaccine doses administered," Langer said. &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;After the lunch break, presentations and discussions shifted to the hepatitis B vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACIP chair Martin Kulldorff reminded the group that the proposed recommendation changes concern only the hep B birth dose — the dose given to babies within 24 hours of birth — to mothers who test negative for the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So if the women test positive for hepatitis B, or if it's unknown, we are not considering any changes for that population," he said. &lt;/p&gt;

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;Recommendation change would take away parents' choice, ACIP member says&lt;/h2&gt;
            
                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Just before the group paused for lunch, ACIP member Dr. Joseph Hibbeln brought up the impact the proposed recommendation change for MMRV vaccines would have on parents who want the single, combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella shot for their children, since they would no longer be covered by the Vaccines for Children program which helps pay for immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So that implies that the parents' choice, unless they want to pay for it themselves, the parents' choice is taken away," he said, adding even if parents wanted the single shot, understood the benefits and risk, or even had a hard time accessing clinical care, "that option is basically taken away from them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Johnson, a representative with the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services, added that the change would also have coverage implications in the Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program as well as individual and group markets.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Dr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians, shared his concerns about the MMRV presentation at the meeting following a recent change in the ACIP process that &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/medical-organizations-kicked-out-cdc-vaccine-workgroups-acip/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;removed top medical organizations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from the committee's working groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You do not have those subject matter experts with the real-world experience to understand the implementation of these vaccines and the concerns of the patients," Goldman said. "You don't have the voice of the patients we take care for. You're not looking at all of the aspects of how we evaluate vaccine implementation. You're looking at very small data points and misrepresenting how it works in the real world and how we take care of our patients. So no, this was not a thoroughly vetted discussion"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other medical organization leaders chimed in to echo his concern and message.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The proposed recommendation language, which will later go to a vote, was presented as follows: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The pediatric vaccine schedule should be updated to reflect the following change: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccines given before age 4 years, the combined MMRV vaccine is not recommended.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children in this age group should receive separate measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine (MMR+V)."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the CDC says the MMRV vaccine may be used in that age range if preferred by parents or caregivers to reduce the number of shots.&lt;/p&gt;

                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;After presentations on the background and potential risks of febrile seizures with an MMRV vaccine — which combines the MMR and varicella shots — versus separate MMR and varicella shots, members discussed whether guidance should be changed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some members were satisfied with the current recommendations, which make clear the slightly higher risks of febrile seizures with the combined shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the current wording is appropriate," Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrics professor who previously served as a member of the Food and Drug Administration's vaccines panel, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others were not assured, saying there were too many assumptions being made. Some also pointed out that even if there are no worries about the physical impact of febrile seizures, the mental impact the event can have on children and families could affect vaccine compliance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Richard Haupt, the head of global medical and scientific affairs, vaccines and infectious diseases at Merck, the vaccine's manufacturer, noted the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vaccination-rates-kindergarteners-fall-exemptions-rise/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;recent decline in vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; among kindergarten children and highlighted the need to make guidance clear for the public. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Considering these trends, any policy decision that compromises the clarity or consistency of vaccination guidance has the potential to further diminish public confidence," he said. &lt;/p&gt;

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;ACIP chair says he was never contacted by ousted CDC director about vaccine concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
            
                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;During Thursday's meeting, ACIP chair and biostatistician Martin Kulldorff noted the removal of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez and other members of CDC leadership, including former chief medical officer Dr. Debra Houry — &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/cdc-susan-monarez-debra-houry-senate-testimony-rfk-jr/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;both of whom testified&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a day prior about their removal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On vaccines, this committee is the key adviser to the CDC director, but during her short tenure, she never contacted me as the ACIP chair about any of her questions or concerns, which would have been natural if she had such concerns, neither was I contacted by any of the three CDC leaders, who subsequently resigned," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff said the CDC leadership left citing divergent opinions about vaccines, but Monarez said she was also pressured by Kennedy to fire career experts without cause and approve vaccine recommendations without scientific evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff also said the American Academy of Pediatrics ended its participation with the committee and ignored invitations for open discussion about vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, for the first time in 30 years, the AAP shared guidance that differed from the U.S. government. The organization said it is "strongly recommending" COVID-19 shots for children ages 6 months to 2 years old. Under Kennedy, the CDC &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-shot-recommendations-american-academy-of-pediatrics-cdc/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;doesn't recommend COVID-19 shots for healthy children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of any age. Instead, it says parents may get their kids vaccinated in consultation with physicians.&lt;/p&gt;

"During the pandemic, I myself was COVID vaccinated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-names/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;An earlier Kennedy pick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, who is retired from the National Institutes of Health, said he has a "neutral mind towards vaccines" and is "approaching this with a scientific equity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. James Pagano, described by Kennedy as a "strong advocate for evidence-based medicine," disclosed that he's been vaccinated numerous times against various diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So I'm not anti-vax," he said. "I am pro-intelligent and informed utilization of these potentially life-saving medications in a manner that reflects the current state of the art regarding their benefits, the target populations, optimal dosing and timing and, yes, of their potential adverse effects in some people."&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The ACIP is convening under an unaccustomed spotlight. The committee usually attracts little attention as it deliberates vaccine schedules and eligibility, but suddenly finds itself navigating political scrutiny, public skepticism and internal upheaval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stakes extend well beyond the technical details of dosing intervals or eligibility cutoffs. The panel's decisions could reshape public trust in childhood vaccines, restrict access to vaccines through Medicaid and Medicare, and signal whether scientific consensus or political pressure will steer the nation's vaccination strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-vaccine-panel-meeting-science-politics-vaccination/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Read more here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;Current recommendations for hepatitis B and MMRV vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;
            
                          &lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;For hepatitis B, the CDC currently recommends the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-notes.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;first dose within 24 hours&lt;/a&gt; after birth. Universal infant vaccination &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-vaccine-panel-meeting-science-politics-vaccination/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;became the norm in 1991 after data showed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; too many cases of hepatitis B among pregnant women were missed during prenatal care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A universal birth dose acts as a safety net, protecting infants whose parent's infection might have been missed. Before birth-dose policies, the U.S. saw &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5416a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;an estimated 1,000 preventable infections in newborns each year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To protect against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (or chickenpox), there are two options: a combo MMRV vaccine or separate MMR and varicella vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC currently recommends a two-dose series beginning at age 12 to 15 months. However, the combination vaccine contains certain risks for younger age groups; specifically, the combo shot carries a slightly higher risk of fever-related "febrile" seizures when used as the first dose in young toddlers aged 12-23 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For dose 1 in children age 12–47 months, it is recommended to administer MMR and varicella vaccines separately," the CDC says, but adds MMRV may be used if preferred.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;Former CDC director said she is "very nervous" about the upcoming childhood vaccine panel recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;While testifying at a Senate hearing Wednesday about why she was ousted as CDC director, Dr. Susan Monarez said she's &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/cdc-susan-monarez-debra-houry-senate-testimony-rfk-jr/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;"very nervous" about the newly appointed ACIP members&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and what their recommendations might be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know that the medical community has raised concerns about whether or not, again, they have the commensurate backgrounds to be able to understand the data, the evidence, and to evaluate it appropriately, but I certainly will be watching," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another part of the hearing, Monarez said she refused to rubber-stamp vaccine recommendations without seeing the evidence behind them because she "built a career on scientific integrity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My worst fear was that I would then be in a position of approving something that would reduce access to lifesaving vaccines to children and others who need them," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monarez added she is not aware of any scientific evidence to support changing the childhood vaccination schedule for measles, chicken pox and hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;

They include several allies he has worked with closely over the years and some have a history as vaccine critics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy appointed the new members directly, breaking with the past practice of agency officials vetting potential experts before sending them to the secretary for approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just this week, the group &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-cdc-acip-members-covid-vaccine-critics/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;gained five new members&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the HHS announced.

                          &lt;h2 class="post-update__headline"&gt;Panel to consider COVID vaccine recommendations Friday as West Coast states move ahead&lt;/h2&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A day before the ACIP meetings kicked off, a group of &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/california-hawaii-oregon-washington-vaccines-covid-west-coast-health-alliance-cdc/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;four West Coast states&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; recommended that all adults and children in those states who want them can receive the COVID-19 vaccine and other common shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement was made in a joint statement from Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, all Democrats, saying they were putting safety before politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidance, which aligns with mainstream medical groups like the American Academy of Family Physicians and American Academy of Pediatrics, comes amid confusion over the CDC's messaging on vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vermont Department of Health issued its vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/document/han-respiratory-virus-vaccine-recommendations-2025-2026.pdf"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; on respiratory viruses Thursday and &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/document/lsid-covid-vaccine-standing-order.pdf"&gt;authorized&lt;/a&gt; Vermont pharmacies to give anyone age five and over access to a Covid-19 booster shot through a standing order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The recommendations are the most important thing so that it is clear for Vermonters and for providers what the health department position is on the COVID-19 vaccine,” interim Health Commissioner Julie Arel said in an interview with VTDigger. “The standing order is a tool to try to help support pharmacists to be able to administer the vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Both the recommendations and the standing order follow the guidance of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Family Physicians and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, according to the department guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vermont Health Department recommends that anyone 6 months old and above get the Covid-19 vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We think anybody who wants a vaccine should be able to get one, but there are certain populations that we think it’s even more important to have them get the vaccine,” Arel said. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Babies between 6 to 24 months see higher rates of hospitalization from Covid-19 and should get vaccinated to prevent the risk of severe illness, Arel added. Vaccination is also particularly important for pregnant people, who can confer immunity in utero; it serves as critical protection for babies before they are old enough to receive a vaccine. The department’s recommendations also underscore the importance for people 65 years old or older and individuals with existing health conditions to get the shots. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Health Department releases vaccine recommendations every year — which includes guidance on RSV and flu vaccination as well. This year, however, the recommendations served to provide added clarity against a backdrop of confusion surrounding the federal guidelines and approvals on vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state’s recommendations come on the same day that a &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/cdc-vaccine-advisory-committee-rfk-jr-vote-measles-hepatitis-b/"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel began&lt;/a&gt; to discuss and vote on Covid-19 vaccine recommendations. Many state public health officials have watched closely to see what the panel may suggest, after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stacked the panel with vaccine skeptics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August, the Food and Drug Administration authorized updated Covid-19 vaccines for this upcoming cold and flu season with the guidance that they should be administered to those 65 and above or with existing health risks. That does not prevent doctors from offering an “off-label” prescription, which a health care provider can give outside the scope of FDA approval.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Vermont’s standing order gives pharmacies room to administer the updated Covid-19 vaccines without having the patient attest to a prior health risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The order strives to make it as easy as possible for pharmacies to issue the vaccines this way, Arel said. “[Off-lable use] is a pretty accepted practice, but it’s a little bit different for pharmacists, and so this is just a way to try to help smooth the path for them to be able to get those vaccines out to more people.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, pharmacies are the only sites in the state that have this season’s Covid-19 vaccines. Doctors’ offices and other clinics, which often get vaccines from the CDC via the state, have not been able to order the vaccines from the federal government. Pharmacies, on the other hand, order vaccines directly from the manufacturer, and thus they have been able to move forward with administering the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Vermont &lt;a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/fullchapter/26/036"&gt;state law prevents&lt;/a&gt; pharmacies from administering vaccines to children under five years old, meaning that this population will have to wait until the vaccines land in their pediatricians’ offices. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“I know it’s frustrating for parents to not be able to get the vaccine yet for their children,” said Arel. “We have to wait for the CDC to make it available for us to order through the usual pathways.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She anticipates that the vaccines will arrive in Vermont by early to mid- October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, a group of Northeastern states also &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/press/pr2025/announce-northeast-public-health-collaborative.page"&gt;formalized&lt;/a&gt; its coalition to collaborate on public health guidance, as the Northeast Public Health Collaborative. Vermont state health officials &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2025/08/28/with-cdc-in-chaos-vermont-joins-regional-coalition-to-navigate-public-health-challenges/"&gt;attended preliminary meetings of the collaborative&lt;/a&gt; but issued its recommendations on respiratory illness independently from the coalition today — &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2025/09/nephc-covid-19-vaccine-consensus-recommendation-final-to-leadership-9_15_2025.pdf"&gt;despite publicizing the recommendations on the same day&lt;/a&gt; as the block of Northeastern states. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of the state’s private insurers — Blue Cross Blue Shield of VT and MVP — confirmed to VTDigger earlier in September that they intend to continue covering COVID-19 vaccines at no cost and with no prior approval. The health department’s recommendations confirm that Medicaid will continue to cover the cost of the shots, and since the FDA has already approved the vaccine for those over 65 or with existing health risks, Medicare, which covers the same age group, should also cover the vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The only unknown, Arel said, are employer-sponsored insurance plans, which are federally regulated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It really behooves folks to cover the vaccine,” she said. “It helps to prevent the most severe forms of the disease.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Getting vaccinated is the best way for us to protect ourselves and others, especially as we head into the fall season,” Governor Phil Scott said in a &lt;a href="https://governor.vermont.gov/press-release/governor-phil-scott-takes-action-ensure-access-covid-19-vaccines-vermonters"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; his office issued highlighting the order. “This order is a necessary step to make sure those who want a vaccine, can get one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The order is effective until August 31, 2026, unless rescinded earlier.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ATHENS, Ohio — Amid an unprecedented deer disease outbreak, the Ohio Wildlife Council is considering a rule change that would limit the upcoming season’s deer harvest in Athens, Washington and Meigs counties. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ODNR Division of Wildlife’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ohiodnr.gov/rules-and-regulations/rule-changes/proposed-rule-changes/wildlife-proposed-rules"&gt;proposed rule change&lt;/a&gt;, subject to approval by the Ohio Wildlife Council, would limit hunting in the three counties by reducing the white-tailed deer bag limit from three to two deer, starting Dec. 1. The rule change was proposed “due to the unprecedented severity” of the outbreak “and to address constituent concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The council held a meeting at the ODNR office in Athens Wednesday night that was well attended. With the meeting room at its capacity of 100, many more crammed into the doorways beside each entrance or sat in the hall straining to listen. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://d2h5b3twh4qcm6.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/18155203/IMG_1510-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-36550" srcset="https://d2h5b3twh4qcm6.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/18155203/IMG_1510-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://d2h5b3twh4qcm6.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/18155203/IMG_1510-300x225.jpg 300w, https://d2h5b3twh4qcm6.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/18155203/IMG_1510-768x576.jpg 768w, https://d2h5b3twh4qcm6.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/18155203/IMG_1510-800x600.jpg 800w, https://d2h5b3twh4qcm6.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/18155203/IMG_1510-400x300.jpg 400w, https://d2h5b3twh4qcm6.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/18155203/IMG_1510-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://d2h5b3twh4qcm6.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/18155203/IMG_1510-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Concerned residents congregate outside the ODNR Division of Wildlife building after Wednesday night’s meeting. Photo by Dani Kington.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of Sept. 18, the public had reported &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://gis.ohiodnr.gov/portal/apps/experiencebuilder/experience/?id=615d8f4f49f94e2aaff3c7fcd232fde7"&gt;nearly 7,500 dead or sick deer&lt;/a&gt; to the ODNR. However, Ryan Balsley of Coolville suggested during the public comment period at Wednesday night’s meeting that state data may not convey the full picture due to underreporting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; Over 60% of this year’s reports came from Athens, Meigs and Washington counties. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The reports of dead and sick deer can largely be attributed to Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease, spread by small insects called midges and fatal to most deer who contract it, according to a presentation at the meeting by Clint McCoy, wildlife biologist at the ODNR Division of Wildlife. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year marks the worst EHD season the state has ever recorded, according to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.farmanddairy.com/news/thousands-of-deer-infected-with-ehd-in-southeast-ohio/886590.html"&gt;Farm and Dairy’s report&lt;/a&gt; from a webinar at which McCoy presented. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;EHD is not harmful to humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many speakers at Wednesday’s meeting shared their own accounts of impacts on local deer herds, including observations of substantially thinned or in some cases vanished herds, dead deer on their properties, and orphaned fawns. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alex Couladis of Lodi Township said a group of neighbors located 30 dead deer within a 1-mile radius of his family’s home. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My deer are gone,” Athens County resident Boone Troyer said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Members of the public who spoke at the meeting were mainly hunters and landowners, and all expressed support for the Division of Wildlife’s proposed rule change. Among them was Jay Edwards, former state representative for Ohio House District 94 and current Ohio Treasurer candidate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many speakers urged the Division of Wildlife to go further to protect the deer population for future seasons, citing both economic and recreational concerns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These deer need pretty much any break we can give them,” one Washington County resident said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tori Maze cited &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.change.org/p/ehd-in-washington-county-ohio-and-surrounding-areas?recruiter=1077894392&amp;amp;recruited_by_id=35a410e0-81e5-11ea-b623-cb48a9864d85&amp;amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;amp;utm_campaign=petition_dashboard&amp;amp;utm_platform=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_medium=copylink"&gt;a petition&lt;/a&gt; she has circulated on Facebook, which calls for the Division of Wildlife to “consider canceling or postponing the 2025 deer season in the worst-affected counties.” The petition also suggests restricting hunters from out of state, in addition to bag limits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Others voiced support for restrictions on hunting doe and fawns, in hopes that immunity to EHD might be passed down. Athens County veterinarian Rick Kroner’s call to restrict hunting of non-antlered deer was met with cheers and applause from the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Deer in southern states often have substantially more immunity to EHD, McCoy said in his presentation. EHD has been spreading north &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://cwhl.vet.cornell.edu/project/epizootic-hemorrhagic-disease"&gt;due to climate change&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In his presentation, McCoy said the increased prevalence of disease in Ohio this year is tied to various environmental factors, though he did not specifically mention climate change. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;McCoy linked the outbreak to warmer-than-average temperatures, higher-than-average precipitation in the spring and early summer, and lower-than-average precipitation in August. Together, these factors created ideal conditions for midges to breed in warm, wet mud, McCoy said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ohio Wildlife Council members appeared receptive to residents’ concerns and suggestions to consider additional restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jim Samuel said he was “moved” by comments from business owners who could be affected by disruptions to the hunting season calling for further restrictions this year. He suggested the council should further reduce the bag limit and suggested the currently proposed rule change wouldn’t accomplish much. Samuel also suggested the council invoke emergency procedures to implement rule changes more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Heather Robinson said of the speeches and audience reactions, “I found it to be personally very persuasive.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tom Vorisek also praised those who spoke for their passion, and said it was “unconscionable” to allow does to be hunted this year. He also said it was “absurd” to ask hunters to self-regulate. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The public comment period for the rule change is open through Thursday, Oct. 16, and comments may be &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/818e314b33624e2daa0983a43227ca53?portalUrl=https://odnr.maps.arcgis.com/&amp;amp;open=web&amp;amp;field:rule_selected=1501_31_15_11&amp;amp;field:rule_package=2025%20Special%20Fall%20Package"&gt;submitted online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is issuing this Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Advisory about a new outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). EVD is a severe illness and is often fatal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, &lt;strong&gt;no suspected, probable, or confirmed EVD cases related to this outbreak have been reported in the United States or outside of the DRC&lt;/strong&gt;. The risk of spread to the United States is considered low at this time. As a precaution, this Health Advisory summarizes CDC recommendations for U.S. public health departments, clinical laboratories, and healthcare workers about potential EVD case identification, testing, and biosafety considerations in clinical laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 8, 2025, CDC issued a &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level1/ebola-democratic-republic-of-the-congo"&gt;Travel Health Notice&lt;/a&gt; for people traveling to the DRC. CDC recommends that all travelers to the affected health zones in DRC avoid contact with ill people during travel and monitor themselves for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ebola/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of EVD while in the outbreak area and for 21 days after leaving. Travelers who develop symptoms during this time should self-isolate and contact local health authorities or a clinician. At this time, CDC is not recommending additional assessments or monitoring of travelers arriving from DRC by the jurisdictional health departments unless mentioned in the existing VHF guidance provided below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="dfe-section" data-section="cdc_health_alert_section_2"&gt;
	&lt;a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="cdc_health_alert_section_2-background" name="Background" title="Background"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="editor-block--title" id="heading-09ntoqh4wk"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 4, 2025, the Ministry of Public Health, Hygiene and Prevention in the DRC declared an EVD outbreak caused by re-emergence of Ebola virus (species &lt;em&gt;Orthoebolavirus zairense) &lt;/em&gt;in the Kasai Province. As of September 18, 37 confirmed cases and 19 deaths, including 4 health workers, have been reported (case fatality rate [CFR] 51%). This is the 16th &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ebola/outbreaks/index.html"&gt;Ebola disease outbreak reported&lt;/a&gt; in DRC since the virus was discovered there in 1976. The Kasai Province has experienced two previous EVD outbreaks: one in 2007 with 264 cases and 187 deaths (CFR 71%), and another in 2008 with 32 cases and 15 deaths (CFR 47%). No suspected, probable, or confirmed EVD cases related to the current outbreak have been reported outside of the DRC or in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current outbreak is centered in the &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level1/ebola-democratic-republic-of-the-congo"&gt;Bulape and Mweka health zones within the Kasai&lt;/a&gt; Province in the DRC. The index case was a 34-year-old pregnant woman (34 weeks gestation) who was admitted to a local hospital on August 20 with symptoms including high fever, bloody diarrhea, hemorrhaging (nasal, oral, anal), vomiting, and severe physical weakness. The patient died on August 25 from multiple organ failure. Two healthcare workers who cared for the patient later developed similar symptoms and died. Blood and buccal swab specimens tested on September 3 at the country's National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) confirmed an outbreak of EVD caused by Ebola virus (species &lt;em&gt;Orthoebolavirus zairense)&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://virological.org/t/the-16th-ebola-virus-disease-outbreak-in-bulape-health-zone-kasai-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-a-new-spillover-event-from-an-unknown-reservoir-host/1003" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="org"&gt;Genomic sequencing performed by INRB&lt;span class="visually-hidden sr-only" aria-label=" external icon" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cdc-icon-external " aria-hidden="true" alt="external icon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests that this is a new introduction of the disease into the human population from an unknown infected animal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC is working with DRC's Ministry of Public Health, Hygiene and Prevention to support the response to this outbreak. CDC deployed three experts from its Atlanta headquarters and two from the CDC DRC country office to provide technical expertise in surveillance, case investigation, and contact tracing. Resources are being mobilized to strengthen laboratory testing, epidemiology, and infection prevention and control measures. Additional cases may be retrospectively identified as the source of the outbreak remains unknown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The risk of spread to the United States is considered low at this time.&lt;/strong&gt; Access to the outbreak region is difficult and there are no direct flights between the DRC and the United States. However, travelers from affected areas in DRC might enter the United States on flights connecting through other countries. Therefore, as a precaution, CDC is working to raise awareness of this outbreak among travelers, public health departments, public health and clinical laboratories, and healthcare workers in the United States. Healthcare providers should be alert and evaluate any patients suspected of having EVD. &lt;strong&gt;It is important for clinicians to obtain a detailed travel history from patients with suspected EVD, especially those who have been in affected areas of the DRC recently. Early consideration of EVD in the differential diagnosis is important for providing appropriate and prompt patient care and diagnostics, and to prevent the spread of infection. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ebola Disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ebola disease is caused by a group of viruses known as orthoebolaviruses (formerly ebolavirus). Ebola disease most commonly affects humans and nonhuman primates, such as monkeys, chimpanzees, and gorillas. Four orthoebolaviruses cause illness in people, presenting as clinically similar disease:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="nested-list"&gt;
&lt;li class="level-1"&gt;Ebola virus (species O&lt;em&gt;rthoebolavirus zairense&lt;/em&gt;) causes Ebola virus disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="level-1"&gt;Sudan virus (species O&lt;em&gt;rthoebolavirus sudanense&lt;/em&gt;) causes Sudan virus disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="level-1"&gt;Taï Forest virus (species O&lt;em&gt;rthoebolavirus taiense&lt;/em&gt;) causes Taï Forest virus disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="level-1"&gt;Bundibugyo virus (species O&lt;em&gt;rthoebolavirus bundibugyoense&lt;/em&gt;) causes Bundibugyo virus disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incubation period for EVD ranges from 2 to 21 days after exposure. A person infected with an orthoebolavirus is not considered contagious until after &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ebola/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; appear. Early "dry" symptoms include fever, aches, pains, and fatigue and later "wet" symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, and unexplained bleeding. Ebola disease is spread through &lt;strong&gt;contact &lt;/strong&gt;(through broken skin or mucous membranes) with the body fluids (e.g., blood, urine, feces, saliva, semen, or other secretions) of a person who is sick with or has died from Ebola disease. Ebola disease is also spread by infected animals, or through contact with objects like needles that are contaminated with the virus. &lt;strong&gt;Ebola disease is not spread through airborne transmission.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ebola/hcp/vaccines/index.html"&gt;Ebola vaccine&lt;/a&gt; (ERVEBO®) is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for preventing EVD due to Ebola virus (species &lt;em&gt;Orthoebolavirus zairense&lt;/em&gt;). ERVEBO® should only be given to patients who &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ebola/hcp/vaccines/ebola-vaccine-administration.html"&gt;meet specific criteria&lt;/a&gt;. Two FDA-approved treatments are currently available to treat Ebola virus infection: &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-issues/ebola#therapeutics" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="gov"&gt;Inmazeb™ and Ebanga™&lt;span class="visually-hidden sr-only" aria-label=" external icon" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cdc-icon-external " aria-hidden="true" alt="external icon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of early diagnosis and treatment, EVD has a high rate of fatality. Previous outbreaks of EVD have had case fatality rates as high as 80 to 90%. With intense supportive care and fluid replacement, fatality rates might be lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC has developed recommendations for U.S.-based organizations (e.g., nongovernmental, faith-based, academic, or aid organizations) with staff working in affected areas: &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/viral-hemorrhagic-fevers/php/partners/recommendations-for-vhf-outbreaks.html"&gt;Recommendations for Organizations Sending U.S.-based Personnel to Areas with VHF Outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            New &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/clinical-consensus/articles/2025/10/cannabis-use-during-pregnancy-and-lactation" target="_blank"&gt;guidance from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt; advises that people abstain from cannabis use during pregnancy and lactation and recommends that providers ask all of their patients about cannabis use before, during and after pregnancy to help avoid potential risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu00043b6n60cx1xhj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cannabis use has increased among pregnant people in the United States amid broadening legalization and growing social acceptance, and the nation’s leading group of ob/gyns says it issued the new recommendations Thursday to offer providers “evidence-based guidelines for counseling, screening, and strategies to reduce cannabis use.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpnnpy800003b6nhm5yzpvi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/19/health/pregnant-women-marijuana/index.html"&gt;analysis &lt;/a&gt;of over 450,000 pregnant American women ages 12 to 44 by the National Institute on Drug Abuse found that cannabis use &lt;a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/news-events/news-releases/2019/06/study-finds-increased-cannabis-use-during-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;more than doubled&lt;/a&gt; between 2002 and 2017.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu00053b6na0s87ik2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When things become more normalized in society, it’s a very natural tendency for us to think that we don’t have to think about the potential risks,” said Dr. Amy Valent, an ob/gyn with the Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University who helped develop the new guidance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu00063b6n2cjyxhai@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “People have been using cannabis for years, and it’s not associated, as far as we know, with … birth defects,” she said. “But should that be the bar for pregnancy safety?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu00073b6neyfqgwem@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is a “paucity of data rigorously investigating the safety or efficacy of cannabis use in human pregnant or lactating individuals,” according to the new guidance from ACOG, which was shared first with CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu00083b6nj1zkzrkh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A lot has changed since the group’s last opinion on the issue from 2017. The research that is now available shows that cannabinoid receptors are present in the fetus as early as 5 weeks, and the main psychoactive component of cannabis, THC, can cross the placenta and transfer into breast milk – and that exposure is associated with risks of adverse outcomes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu00093b6ni2eb96id@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Changing cannabis laws and reports of increased use during pregnancy initially spurred interest and questions among ACOG members, Valent said, and ongoing policy inconsistencies called for a concise summary of the science. Dozens of experts involved with an ACOG committee for clinical consensus in obstetrics have been developing this new guidance for years, assessing all related research that has been done over the past two decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfppfgq900003b6nxkxa240m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Their assessment suggests that cannabis exposure during pregnancy has been associated with low birth weight, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit and perinatal mortality. There are also potential neurodevelopmental consequences from cannabis exposure, including attention deficit disorders, memory challenges and intellectual disabilities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000b3b6nttaf9hnb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s difficult to quantify the amount of cannabis use and the associated degree of adverse outcomes, Valent said, but the goal with this guidance is similar to others around substance use during pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000c3b6nced3sp95@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have to recognize all the different conditions and environmental things that can influence fetal growth and development, and the (pregnant patient) themselves, of course,” she said. “How can we risk-reduce their pregnancy to be able to help support a healthier version?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000d3b6n64k58aco@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new guidance makes a pointed distinction between validated screening tools and biologic testing for cannabis use.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000e3b6nx7zu6s5j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Drug tests using hair, urine or other biological materials have resulted in biased treatment against members of racial and ethnic minority groups, the guidance says, and their use is “strongly discouraged.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000f3b6nrj33jnt1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead, universal screening through various interview methods or self-reporting creates opportunities for intervention before delivery – and “supports equitable and nondiscriminatory health practices.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpq0nv900063b6n6yv4mzfa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s important that the screening conversation “remains nonjudgmental and supportive,” said Dr. Cara Poland, a faculty member at Michigan State University and board-certified addiction medicine physician, who was not involved with the creation of the new guidance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpq14o100093b6n8ada03e4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many people are not aware that cannabis can affect a pregnancy, and doctors can ask permission to discuss the topic, Poland said. One way to open up the conversation could involve saying something like: “Would it be OK with you if I asked you some questions about cannabis and other drug use?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpq5m07000c3b6neuoi6m7c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s also critical that the screening avoid the risk of punishment, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpqgfk5000l3b6n0793pyoi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            State laws on drug testing during pregnancy and the involvement of child protection agencies are inconsistent and can lack clarity, the new guidance says, and providers should be aware of local implications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpq928x000f3b6nfz5wb5yj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our obligations as health care systems and individual providers in reporting substance use can make this space uniquely different to navigate than other spaces,” Poland said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpqc8vj000i3b6nswj6s484@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You’re not at risk of losing your child because you are not adherent in other areas of medical recommendations,” she said. For example, “nobody’s reporting on whether or not somebody’s following their diabetes diet. When somebody is diagnosed with gestational diabetes, you treat it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000g3b6nor5rm3pe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Simply having the discussion may raise a patient’s awareness of potential risks and influence their behavior during pregnancy, according to the ACOG guidance. Many patients may use cannabis in an effort to self-manage nausea associated with pregnancy or to relieve anxiety and stress.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Better communication between patients and their providers about these underlying symptoms may help curb cannabis use, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpqo8lt000o3b6nxc7zkcw4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Each patient is different, and asking about other ways they’ve tried to manage their symptoms can reinforce a personalized approach to care, Valent said. Sometimes cannabis can actually be the root cause of nausea, she said, or it may be helped by exercise, eating more often or taking certain medicines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpno2eu000i3b6nhrmoulj2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The benefit of screening is that it starts conversations and then comes individualization to patient needs,” Valent said. “We really need to be able to talk more broadly with our patients about their symptoms and how we can best support them. I think there’s beauty to communication and conversation, and hopefully this guidance just helps support people to understand that we just want to provide a more comprehensive conversation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;PITTSFIELD — Seven patients have tested positive for the bacteria that causes Legionnaires' disease, Berkshire Health Systems reported on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the patients later died, although because of their existing comorbidities, it's not possible to know whether their death was the result of their infection, officials said. Not all seven patients with positive tests were admitted for treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That has led the hospital to a series of steps to assure the safety of its water supply, including increased chlorination and filtration and providing bottled water for drinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't know where people got this from but it behooved us to do what we felt was in best interest of all patients, no matter what the number was," said Dr. James Lederer, the chief medical officer and chief quality officer for Berkshire Health Systems, which operates Berkshire Medical Center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legionella, a naturally occurring bacteria found in fresh water, can cause Legionnaires’ disease — a potentially fatal lung infection. Symptoms can include fever, cough, or shortness of breath. The disease can be treated with commonly available antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[It] hits fairly quickly, and it's rapid onset and aggressive," Lederer said. As is the case with COVID, patients with underlying conditions and weakened immune systems are most vulnerable,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-image layout-horizontal  subscriber-hide  tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-image tnt-inline-relation-child tnt-inline-presentation-default tnt-inline-alignment-center tnt-inline-width-two-thirds"&gt;&lt;figure class="photo layout-horizontal hover-expand letterbox-style-white"&gt;&lt;span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-c10c8ed6-19d0-4138-a797-0484f0faaf2c" data-instance="#gallery-items-e89ee005-a895-4657-a9dc-ac10018bb09c-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-e89ee005-a895-4657-a9dc-ac10018bb09c"&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past four months, the BMC laboratory has reported seven positive patient tests for the bacteria. The last known positive test result was recorded Aug. 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a note being sent to patients and staff, Berkshire Health Systems on Thursday said the hospital has flushed its water system and is "currently deploying a heightened level of precautions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hospital also detected slight increases in the levels of Legionella bacteria in its water, though those levels "remained within acceptable levels, according to our Water Management Plan," the statement said. The hospital did not say what those levels are, though Lederer said DPH's target is always zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legionnaires’ disease does not typically spread from person to person. Legionella spreads through tiny droplets of water containing the bacteria that get into the air. The disease often is spread through large-scale, central air conditioning systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no way to determine for certain how the patients contracted Legionella, but because some patients interacted with Berkshire Medical Center during a 14-day window prior to the onset of symptoms, the CDC defines these cases as possible health care-associated Legionella, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hospital also has notified the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A positive test for Legionella is not the same as a diagnosis of Legionnaires’ disease, Lederer said. “Not all of them are classic pneumonia — either it was very early onset or other reasons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a number of patients who tested positive were admitted as patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s impossible to know where the patients were exposed to Legionella, Lederer said. And some of the patients who were admitted had significant underlying medical conditions that weakened their immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Lederer, the hospital regularly provides water samples to a third-party testing vendor "so we can get an ongoing flow of information on those parts of systems we feel most at risk" due to their age or length. The longer a supply pipe runs, the greater the odds water within that pipe can become stagnant, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a testing center in Massachusetts detects Legionella in a hospital setting, it's obliged to report that result to DPH, Lederer said. Those test results, along with the reports of patients testing positive, spurred the hospital to take action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lederer said BMC is taking its response to the "highest level of mitigation strategy so we can return to what seen before and hope to have — which is zero colony forming units in water samples."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons Legionnaires’ disease is often severe is “it tends affect those most significantly at risk,” Lederer said. Younger patients who don't have underlying conditions or immunity deficiencies may still contract pneumonia from it, “but the likelihood of doing better is much higher ... you’re not the optimal host.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those steps taken by the hospital include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Increasing chlorine levels in the hospital’s water supply to disinfect the system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Increasing the sensitivity of the filters on all patient showers and ice machines to provide an even higher level of filtration for the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Providing bottled water to all patients and staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As those tasks are implemented, the hospital will collect water samples and send them out for testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing for declaring the issue resolved is up to DPH, not the hospital, Lederer said. "They want to see a set of three negative cultures," he said — meaning three rounds of tests showing no Legionella in the water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pittsfield Mayor Peter Marchetti said he was updated Thursday by Berkshire Health Systems and Department of Public Health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the moment [the culprit] does not appear to be the city water system,” Marchetti said. “We will be participating in any conversations with DPH and the hospital going forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city water department does not test for Legionella, Marchetti said, for one very good reason: The level of chlorine the city uses to treat its drinking water is enough to kill the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A message left with DPH was not returned by press time Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="tncms-inline-relcontent tncms-inline-relcontent-info tncms-inline-alignment-center tncms-inline-width-two-thirds"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Legionnaires' disease information&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Legionnaires’ disease?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Legionnaires’ disease is a form of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s Legionella? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Legionella is a naturally occurring water-borne bacteria found in fresh water environments.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where else are Legionella bacteria found?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Many outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease have been related to contaminated air conditioning cooling towers, but not window air conditioners.

Naginah Gogolli’s white toilet seat began mysteriously turning purple, revealing a secret that even a pregnancy test hadn’t yet confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Beginning of 2020, me and my husband decide to get off birth control, and we weren't actively trying — if it happens, it happens, it's in God's hands,” Gogolli explains exclusively to PEOPLE. Life was already uncertain as her office went remote and the stress of the pandemic set in, but the odd color staining her toilet seat was not something she ever anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her first thought was purely practical, not life-changing. “I thought that either me or my husband were wearing not good quality clothing,” she says, laughing at the memory of scrubbing her bathroom in frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convinced that fabric dye was to blame, Gogolli tried every cleaning method she could find. “We cleaned it several times a day after it never [came] off…we’re nonstop cleaning it,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mystery deepened when her family came to visit. “Just like in the video, basically I had family over who was insinuating that I was pregnant,” Gogolli shares. Her sister didn’t hesitate. “My sister's like you’re pregnant and I'm like the f--- girl, no I'm not,” she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, she was still days away from even missing a period. “I definitely am not pregnant now... There’s no way they're right,” Gogolli says with a laugh. The teasing from her family stuck in her head, even as she dismissed it. “Honestly, once I found out that I was pregnant, I couldn't wait to tell them that they were right,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her small apartment bathroom soon offered more clues. “My bathroom is really small, so right next to the toilet like on the right side, your right thigh is gonna be touching the sink a little bit, like the bottom part of the sink, which is also white, so where my thigh touches is also bright freaking purple,” she shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naginah Gogolli&lt;/p&gt; Naginah Gogolli's purple toilet seat&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was enough to send her husband to his phone. “That same day he Googled it,” Gogolli remembers. The searches pointed to everything from fabric dye to rare skin conditions. “The first thing to pop up was like normal color transfer from clothes, then it was the skin disorder, and then some women have reported this during pregnancy,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even then, Gogolli wasn’t convinced. “So my husband's like you're pregnant and I'm like no I'm not — like you guys are all so stupid,” she shares. But her body had other plans. “After cleaning up dinner, I have a very strong stomach… and immediately I run to my purple toilet seat and I'm just puking my brains out,” Gogolli recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her husband’s reaction added comic relief. “Because he was like just hysterically laughing, like no, you’re definitely pregnant, the purple toilet seat, now you're throwing up, you’re pregnant,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The very next day brought confirmation. “Sure enough, [I] end up taking a pregnancy test like a day or so later... and I was pregnant,” she shares. For Gogolli, it was the beginning of an unforgettable journey. “I'm just so shocked [by] how many other women it’s happened to,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her TikTok about the purple toilet seat quickly blew up. “I was blown away by the comments of people saying, yeah, me too, me too,” Gogolli tells PEOPLE. Validation from strangers mattered more than she expected. “Seeing the feedback that I got on my social media was honestly really validating for me,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical experts, however, had never heard of it. “The day I went for my confirmation…my first appointment to confirm I was pregnant, that was the first thing I said,” Gogolli remembers. “And she was like, huh, like no, I've never heard of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is no medical research confirming that a purple toilet seat indicates pregnancy, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/blue-toilet-seat#hormones" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Healthline;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Healthline&lt;/a&gt; reports that the change of color could come from an array of factors, including pregnancy hormones and Chromhidrosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women have also taken to Reddit to share their experiences. One woman &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/141294r/purple_toilet_seat/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:writes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;, "On normal prenatals and have been since I found out, no changes. All of a sudden, randomly, I turned my toilet seat purple today. Like a full on purple butt print on the seat, purple. I wasn’t wearing new clothes, haven’t worn jeans in weeks, nothing that would have dyed my skin or transferred or anything like that. Super weird."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the unknowns, the timing of Gogolli's discovery felt strangely right. “It was kind of a blessing in disguise… I was home, I was happy even though the outside world, you know, awful things were happening,” she shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extra time at home gave her a chance to savor the early days. “Finding out that I'm pregnant, being home in peace with my husband, I don't think it could have gone any other… any better way in my opinion,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naginah Gogolli&lt;/p&gt; Naginah when she was pregnant&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extra time at home gave her a chance to savor the early days. “Finding out that I'm pregnant, being home in peace with my husband, I don't think it could have gone any other… any better way in my opinion,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As her pregnancy unfolded, it brought enormous challenges. “He has a really rare heart defect…it was just a 1% chance of me even having a baby with that defect,” she shares. The diagnosis was devastating. “He has complete congenital heart block, and so that was diagnosed at 20 weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she clung to signs of hope. “I definitely think it was a spiritual sign for me at least,” she says of the purple toilet seat. Every milestone felt miraculous. “The fact that he's even alive is such a blessing,” Gogolli adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, her son is thriving. “He will need a pacemaker to live eventually… but thank God again, he's such a little miracle,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors once doubted he would survive. “First it was, he's not gonna survive pregnancy, then it was, okay, the second you give birth, we're gonna rush him to OR, and he's gonna get the pace[maker], and they didn't need to do that,” she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, her family got to bring him home. “We were in NICU for a little while… he didn't need [the pacemaker] and they sent us home,” she says. Nearly five years later, she remains grateful. “I'm so blessed at even getting to where we are today, and he's almost 5, so I'm lucky,” she shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naginah Gogolli&lt;/p&gt; Naginah, her husband, and two boys&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her viral story continues to resonate. “A couple of comments were like oh my gosh, my toilet seat is also this color… They came back and commented that they were pregnant,” she says. That unexpected bond with strangers left her touched. “That felt nice, like oh my video kind of prompted them to go get a pregnancy test,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience also shaped how she approaches her body. “Ever since his pregnancy, I'm very much like... I'm going with my intuition, I'm going with what my body is telling me,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It changed her perspective on motherhood. “I just feel like a lot of women are told not to trust their body because that’s not textbook, but it’s like no, your body is always telling you something,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/woman-learns-shes-pregnant-after-toilet-seat-turns-purple-exclusive-11808471" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 20:28:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE9XWUFBNEFsb1ZaRV9FbkR2ZDNQck04ZU9uRnRPLXpnNXhZYlJ6UVFRcjFMb1BMOHhoRHM4TWp6UDU4aWR3Vk1JcVptaHdiNzNmYTA0Um5hNEtOOHIyd3lrOXRYUWdFWEpvc045RGozT2NPQVRR</guid></item><item><title>报告：在治疗COVID-19时必须考虑心脏风险- CIDRAP</title><link>https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/report-cardiac-risks-must-be-considered-when-treating-covid-19</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new report published in the&lt;em&gt; European Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/em&gt; suggests repeat COVID-19 vaccination may be necessary to mitigate the cardiovascular risk associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors represent experts from across Europe, and said they authored the report to make concrete recommendations for prevention, rehabilitation, and long-term care for cardiovascular patients because both acute COVID-19 infection and long COVID have serious effects on the heart and blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As the initial public health messaging largely focused on pulmonary complications of COVID 19, many people with COVID-19 may not be aware of the increased cardiovascular risks associated to the disease," &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurjpc/advance-article/doi/10.1093/eurjpc/zwaf540/8255559#532077239"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the authors wrote&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more than 1 billion global COVID-19 infections reported in the past 5 years, the authors said there was a need for clear clinical guidance on cardiovascular disease, including myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), myocardial infarction (heart attack), heart failure, and thromboembolism (blockage caused by a blood clot) in an artery or vein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise rehab critical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the absence of clear evidence-based guidance, patients risk harmful treatments and clinicians face uncertainty," said lead author Vassilios Vassiliou, MBBS, PhD, from University of East Anglia and Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital in England, in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1098462"&gt;&lt;u&gt;press release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the European Society of Cardiology, which publishes the journal. "This statement [report] provides unified, practical recommendations for prevention, rehabilitation, and long-term care, while also identifying critical research gaps to ensure strategies continue to evolve with emerging evidence." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report says COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular symptoms, especially those with prior heart disease, should begin an exercise rehabilitation program 6 to 12&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;weeks after infection to strengthen the heart. Patients with long COVID—symptoms months after the initial infection—should undertake a stepwise program that reintroduces activity.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Careful watching and follow up is also needed for patients with COVID-19, who should be told they are at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease after the virus. "Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 exhibit an elevated risk of cardiovascular events lasting up to 3&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;years post-infection," the authors wrote.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Comprehensive prevention strategies should incorporate pharmacological and lifestyle interventions to address residual cardiovascular risks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More long-COVID clinics needed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors also addressed long COVID. They estimate 100 million people are currently living with long COVID globally, and about 5 million (5%) have cardiac long COVID, reporting angina (chest pain), breathlessness, arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm), heart failure, fatigue, and dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to ensure patients have equitable access to rehabilitation services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to cardiac rehabilitation, regular COVID-19 vaccination is important in both preventing severe COVID infections and reducing the chances of getting long COVID. The authors said the number of cardiac rehabilitation centers in Europe are too few given the increasing burden of long COVID.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to ensure patients have equitable access to rehabilitation services, support primary prevention through vaccination and lifestyle programmes, and fund research into long Covid and cardiovascular outcomes," said Vassiliou. "Health systems must be prepared for the ongoing burden, not just the acute infection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

A new review shows that adaptive immune cells—T and B cells—also play a crucial role, sometimes worsening brain damage, sometimes offering protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest Alzheimer’s is not only a disease of plaques and tangles but also of immune imbalance. By rebalancing immune responses, future therapies may offer more precise and effective ways to slow or prevent the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune Involvement:&lt;/strong&gt; T and B cells can cross into the brain, influencing Alzheimer’s progression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Double-Edged Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Some immune cells worsen damage, while others appear protective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Future treatments may involve vaccines or therapies that rebalance immunity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating condition that affects more than 55 million people globally and accounts for the majority of dementia cases. With aging populations, its impact on families, health systems, and societies continues to grow. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of research, there is still no cure, and available treatments offer only modest benefits. Understanding its root causes remains one of the greatest challenges in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112876"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain, immune cells, and a scale." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/immune-balance-alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This insight could transform our understanding of AD and inspire new treatment approaches. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long known that AD is linked to the buildup of harmful proteins in the brain and the gradual loss of nerve cells. One of these proteins, amyloid, clumps together outside brain cells to form sticky plaques, while another protein, tau, twists into tangles inside the cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these changes disrupt communication between neurons and contribute to memory loss. In recent years, ongoing brain inflammation has also been recognized as a key feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, this inflammation was thought to be mainly caused by the brain’s first line of defense, but new evidence suggests that other parts of the immune system can also play a significant role. This insight could transform our understanding of AD and inspire new treatment approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To facilitate further understanding, researchers from the Department of Neurology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, and the Fujian Key Laboratory of Molecular Neurology in China reviewed decades of studies examining the role of adaptive immunity in AD. Their review, led by Dr. Xiaochun Chen, was published in the &lt;em&gt;Chinese Medical Journal&lt;/em&gt; and made available online on August 5, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AD has long been viewed mainly through the lens of amyloid, tau, and innate immunity,” says Dr. Chen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our review shows that adaptive immune cells, such as T and B cells, are also deeply involved, and this opens up new ways of thinking about how the disease develops and how it might be treated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adaptive immune system is best known for mounting long-term, targeted responses through specialized cells called T and B cells. In Alzheimer’s, these cells appear to cross into the brain through a weakened blood–brain barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once inside, they interact with brain cells in complex ways. Some T cells release inflammatory molecules that worsen damage, while others seem to have protective effects. Likewise, B cells may contribute to harmful immune reactions but can also help clear toxic proteins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adaptive immunity appears to act like a double-edged sword,” says Dr. Chen.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Some immune cells seem to speed up memory loss and brain damage, while others may help protect against it. Learning how to tip the balance toward the helpful side is an urgent goal for future research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These insights have important implications for therapy. Immunotherapies that target amyloid have shown mixed results, with drugs such as aducanumab and lecanemab sparking both hope and controversy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review suggests that a broader approach—one that also considers adaptive immune responses—could provide more effective outcomes. Potential strategies include treatments aimed at rebalancing T and B cell activity, developing vaccines, or tailoring therapies to individuals with specific genetic risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors stress that much remains to be understood. Researchers are still working to clarify how immune cells enter the brain, why they act differently in different patients, and how age-related immune changes intersect with Alzheimer’s. These questions will be crucial for designing precise diagnostics and effective therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adaptive immunity has moved from being a side note to being recognized as a key player in AD,” Dr. Chen adds. “We are only beginning to grasp its complexity, but this line of research may help transform the way we prevent and treat the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, this review highlights the growing consensus that Alzheimer’s is not only a disorder of plaques and tangles but also a disease of immune imbalance. As the burden of Alzheimer’s continues to rise worldwide, understanding and harnessing the immune system may open new avenues for prevention and treatment, offering hope to patients, families, and healthcare systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Alzheimer’s disease and immune system research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ec958d828b9885828b9885828bac8f818d9c84c2839e8b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tingting Yang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://cmaph.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Tingting Yang – Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/cm9.0000000000003695" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Adaptive immunity in the neuroinflammation of Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;” by Xiaochun Chen et al. &lt;em&gt;Chinese Medical Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptive immunity in the neuroinflammation of Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is a growing public health challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation has been proposed as a prominent pathological feature of AD and has traditionally been attributed to the innate immune system. However, emerging evidence highlights the involvement of adaptive immunity, particularly T and B lymphocytes, in the neuroinflammatory processes of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear how adaptive immune responses, originally intended to protect the body, contribute to chronic inflammation and neuronal dysfunction in AD. Here, we review the roles of adaptive immunity, cellular composition, and niches and their contribution to AD development and progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, we synthesize the crosstalk between adaptive immunity and the innate immune system of the central nervous system (CNS), which is mainly mediated by glial cells and myeloid cells, and their interrelationships with amyloid-β (Aβ)/Tau pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hypothesized that the alterations observed in innate immunity in AD mirror age-related immune alterations, whereas the dysregulation of adaptive immunity contributes more accurately to disease-specific immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targeting adaptive immunity in the context of neuroinflammation may provide new insights into potential therapeutic strategies designed to modulate immune responses, thereby facilitating the diagnosis, intervention, and treatment of AD.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 20:11:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE5zR1JvY3d0SDBLcGlMeHZJdkFMQ0xNUVdwc0NwaGpoWFdWaUNBRjFCcXdBYXZJM1BWZmExZ25FRTNkY3plTWdsalZIUXFqaEpkNnU0R3hWUHlWVXEwekhIV2J1cTFsY1VHT3FmYjFrcXh3Zw</guid></item><item><title>“你的愤怒是如此正当” ：在法院否认她的正义后，在用药错误后皮肤“融化”的女性痛苦地尖叫- yahoo.com</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/rage-justified-woman-whose-skin-200000989.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A woman who made headlines after her skin "melted off" following incorrect medication dosage has just been dealt a further blow—losing a medical malpractice appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Khaliah Shaw has turned to TikTok to vent her frustrations after a legal battle over a decade in the making finally came to an unsatisfying conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I f**king lost!" she screamed in the emotional clip.

I have never been able to fully recover from this ordeal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Did Khaliah Shaw win her lawsuit?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Shaw sued the nurse practitioner, pharmacist, and others involved in her care. She won, and a jury awarded her more than $40 million in damages. But under Georgia’s apportionment law, each defendant is only responsible for the percentage of fault the jury assigns them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A comment on Shaw's TikTok, which she "liked," additionally pointed out that she "got NOTHING from the facility because under GEORGIA LAW they are IMMUNE from liability because they are part of the GOVERNMENT." As the facility was deemed responsible for a large percentage of what happened to her, that effectively meant she could only recover a fraction of the jury's award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Shaw tried appealing the decision, arguing that she should be able to recover the full amount of the jury's award from those she sued. Ultimately, she &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/justice-for-khaliah-overcoming-legal-injustice" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, the "higher courts refused to hear my case. The Supreme Court wouldn't even grant review."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The original lawsuit noted that her medical bills had already reached over &lt;a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/local/investigations/womans-skin-melts-off-after-medication-error/85-437871972" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$3.45 million;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;$3.45 million&lt;/a&gt; as of 2017. The estimate on Shaw's &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/justice-for-khaliah-overcoming-legal-injustice" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoFundMe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; puts that number at closer to $4.5 million. After legal fees, she said she received an extremely small fraction of what she was awarded, an insult that is exacerbated by the fact that this incident has left her unable to work due to disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="mb-4 border-l-2 pl-5 italic text-tertiary"&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Frustrated viewers offer support&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In recent years, Shaw has been sharing her story on TikTok, drawing attention to flaws in the medical, health insurance, and legal systems in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even just since posting her emotional video on Tuesday, which has racked up over 3.8 million views, she's posted dozens of videos clarifying her situation, explaining nuances about what happened, diving into systemic racism in the medical community, and so much more, with most of her videos drawing tens of thousands of views each in that short time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And the comments largely reflect support and frustration on her behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Your rage is SO JUSTIFIED," wrote @bri.stlouiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"This is the most valid crashout i've ever heard," @jomomma72 agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A number of people also referenced Luigi Mangione, who was charged in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, and who has become sort of a dark folk hero among those sick and tired of the way health insurance focuses more on profit than supporting care for people in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"This is EXACTLY why luigi did what he did," @default.nickname665 claimed.

"State laws prevented me from getting justice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Shaw also noted that she's exploring alternative options for pursuing justice at this time and directed people towards her &lt;a href="https://gofund.me/612c6c74e" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoFundMe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt;.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Emma Priest has told of her 'disbelief' at discovering her new dog, Penny, had both male and female genitalia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Penny the Golden Retriever became the newest addition to Mrs Priest's family last September&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She was initially bought as a 'therapy dog' for her Mrs Priest's two disabled children, who have autism and ADHD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Penny was born as a hermaphrodite, an extremely rare condition which means she has a sperm-producing testicle and one functioning ovary which produces eggs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'We were in total shock because even now the vets are not really able to confirm what sex she is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You take it to the vet thinking you've brought a girl and to be told that they couldn't give us an answer as to whether she was a boy or a girl was just total disbelief, really.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though Penny's novelty has further endeared her to Mrs Priest's family and their loved ones, it has posed extreme health risks which could be problematic should the pooch not have surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to the location of her undescended testicle, which vets believe to be wrapped around her lymph nodes, Penny is at risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The poorly pup has also suffered with complications from Giardia, a parasite which invokes sickness, and the bacterial infection Campylobacter, since Mrs Priest first took her home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother-of-two said it is unclear whether Penny's sickness  - which also saw her hooked to an IV drip at just 12 weeks old - have descended from poor breeding, or if it is related to her hermaphroditism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With vets unable to clarify such questions and the original breeder not claiming responsibility, Mrs Priest says her focus is now on getting Penny happy and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Priest said: 'The only way that is going to happen is for her to have this huge surgery, because they've said it could be catastrophic if we leave her any longer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mr Priest was the first to spot that something was not quite right with their new pup&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Penny., who has a sperm-producing testicle and a functioning ovary which produces eggs, also has half a womb, half a uterus, and one fallopian tube&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Due to the location of her undescended testicle, which vets believe to be wrapped around her lymph nodes, Penny is at risk of cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The pup has been poorly ever since Mrs Priest brought her home - and is facing an invasive spay surgery on October 16&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The vets are quite confident that, because the external part is female, although it's in the wrong place, then she will lead a female life once her insides have been taken out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But they still don't know, which I guess these days is cool to be non-binary. But from a medical point of view, we just want her to be healthy and to be able to lead the most healthy life she can.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As Penny's condition is classed as a 'birth defect' by vets, funding surgeries does not come under Mrs Priest's pet insurance, meaning she has forked out 'thousands of pounds' over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the financial burden, Mrs Priest says she just wants the invasive spay, scheduled for October 16, to pass without problems - marking the end of what has been a 'horrible year' for Penny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her worries have not been alleviated by vets' warning that they may have to 'rip her open' if they are unable to remove the testicle laparoscopically - but the mother-of-two is desperate for a positive outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'We're dreading it. We really are dreading her having to go, but from a health point of view, she has to have this done.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She's so incredibly special and she's our world. We absolutely adore her'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Last month, the FDA placed &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/fda-oks-updated-covid-vaccines-places-limits-kids-adults"&gt;major restrictions&lt;/a&gt; on who should receive the vaccines, notably complicating access for young children. At the time, the &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/news--publications-new/articles/2025/fdas-narrow-covid-19-vaccine-label-ignores-science-and-puts-millions-of-lives-at-risk/" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)"&gt;Infectious Diseases Society of America&lt;/a&gt; said the FDA's narrowed indications put millions of American lives at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/rfk-jr-says-no-covid-vaccines-healthy-children-pregnant-women"&gt;also said&lt;/a&gt; healthy children and pregnant women should not receive COVID vaccination. Tomorrow, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), will take up COVID immunization and could further restrict vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johns Hopkins University researchers led today's study, which projected weekly COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths in six scenarios of immune escape (20% to 50% per year) and vaccine recommendations (no recommendation, vaccination of at-risk people only, and vaccination for all eligible groups) from April 2024 to April 2025.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, under the 20% immune-escape rate, a vaccine formulated based on a variant circulating in April 2024 would be 20% less effective against symptomatic infection with a strain circulating in April 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Annually reformulated vaccines were assumed to be 75% effective against hospitalization for variants circulating on June 15, 2024, and available on September 1, 2024," the study authors wrote. "Age- and state-specific coverage was assumed to be as reported in September 2023 to April 2024."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hospitalizations at low levels in all scenarios&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For the 332 million US residents (estimated 58 million aged 65 years and older), COVID-19 was expected to lead to 814,000 (95% projection interval [PI], 400,000 to 1.2 million) hospitalizations and 54,000 (95% PI, 17,000 to 98,000) deaths in 2024-25, similar to the previous year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vaccination of high-risk groups only was projected to cut hospitalizations (compared with no vaccination) by 76,000 (95% confidence interval [CI], 34,000 to 118,000) and deaths by 7,000 (95% CI, 3,000 to 11,000) in low and high immune-escape scenarios. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Compared with vaccinating high-risk groups only, universal vaccination was predicted to provide direct and indirect benefits, preventing another 11,000 hospitalizations and 1,000 deaths in those aged 65 years and older.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a high immune-escape scenario, the authors estimate that e&lt;/span&gt;xpanding recommendations to all ages would prevent an additional 28,000 hospitalizations and 2,000 deaths than would vaccinating high-risk groups only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Under all scenarios, projections suggested that national COVID-19 hospitalizations would remain below the CDC threshold for low hospital admission levels (fewer than 10 weekly hospitalizations per 100,000 people) in spring 2024, followed by a rise in late summer and fall toward a winter peak, similar to or lower than the previous winter's peak. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Substantial benefit' of broader vaccination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the high immune-escape scenarios, a projected summer peak was more pronounced. In general, weekly national hospitalization projections stayed below high CDC hospitalization levels (more than 20 weekly hospitalizations per 100,000 people) under all scenarios.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Averted COVID-19 burden due to vaccination was robust across immune escape scenarios, emphasizing the substantial benefit of broader vaccine availability for all individuals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Ensemble projections suggested that although vaccinating high-risk groups had substantial benefits in reducing disease burden, maintaining the vaccine recommendation for all individuals had the potential to save thousands more lives," the researchers wrote. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Despite divergence of projections from observed disease trends in 2024 to 2025—possibly driven by variant emergence patterns and immune escape—averted COVID-19 burden due to vaccination was robust across immune escape scenarios, emphasizing the substantial benefit of broader vaccine availability for all individuals," they concluded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
