Is Greta Thunberg the literal antichrist? Are the three predominant ideological schools in Europe environmentalism, "Islamic Shariah law" and "Chinese Communist totalitarian takeover"? Is AI "woke" and capable of following Elon Musk to Mars? Peter seems to think so! Perhaps the "just asking questions" school of journalism could add "&lt;em&gt;hey, what the fuck are you talking about&lt;/em&gt;" to its repertoire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, many of these assertions fall squarely into the realm of things that exist within Thiel's mind palace rather than verifiable facts, with at least one notable exception. Relatively early in their chat, Peter tells Ross the following [emphasis ours]:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we look at biotech, something like dementia, Alzheimer’s — &lt;strong&gt;we’ve made zero progress in 40 to 50 years&lt;/strong&gt;. People are completely stuck on beta amyloids. It’s obviously not working. It’s just some kind of a stupid racket where the people are just reinforcing themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a pretty bold claim! It's also completely untrue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was no treatment 40 or 50 years ago for Alzheimer's disease," Sterling Johnson, a professor of Geriatrics and Gerontology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, told Engadget. "What we've been able to do in the last 20 years has been actually pretty extraordinary. We've developed markers that help us identify when this disease starts, using the using amyloid markers and tau biomarkers, we know that the disease actually begins 20 years before the symptoms do, and that is a critical thing to know if we are going to prevent this disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, Alzheimer's remains incurable. But the absence of a miracle cure does not negate the accomplishments thus far in detection and prevention. "The first treatments were these window dressing treatments. It's like treating the symptoms like you would treat a cold [...] The first generation of amyloid therapy was that kind of approach where it just addressed the symptoms by amping up the neurons and increasing the neurotransmitters available to the to the brain cells." Johnson, whose team runs one of the largest and longest &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://wrap.wisc.edu/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; on people at risk for developing Alzheimer's disease, added, "Now we have opportunities to actually modify the disease biology through the amyloid pathway, but also we're focused on the other proteinopathy — which is &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tauopathy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tau;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;tau&lt;/a&gt; — and there's clinical trials underway."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thiel, a well-known advocate for advancements in radical life extension (including a &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/peter-thiel-wants-to-inject-himself-with-young-peoples-blood?srsltid=AfmBOorWPpJna-9f4HpVxwkhBkh_6IbM-7PPlpHzAhmc5HoK02GTRv4s" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reported;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; interest in injecting himself with the blood of young people) sees the state of scientific research in this area as sluggish and risk averse. But the groundbreaking work is happening at this moment. Professor Johnson pointed to a monoclonal antibody called &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/roche-alzheimer-drug-could-prevent-onset/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gantenerumab;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;gantenerumab&lt;/a&gt;. In an early test of 73 participants with inherited mutations that would cause them to overproduce amyloid in the brain, it cut the number of participants who developed Alzheimer's symptoms practically in half. "The big phase-three prevention trials are happening right now." Those are using lecanemab and donanemab, two other monoclonal treatments, which Johnson clarified are "already known to be better than gantenerumab at clearing out beta-amyloid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For someone who fashions himself as a heterodox thinker, Thiel certainly seems to have stumbled on a remarkably similar talking point to current Trump administration FDA head Robert F Kennedy Jr. "Alzheimer's is a very, very good example of how [National Institute of Health] has gone off the rails over the past 20 years ago with research on amyloid plaques" Kennedy &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/DzkPRscLkpQ?si=PS-Qgx5bZFIrVGxG&amp;amp;t=1319" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at a Department of Health budgetary hearing last month. He claimed the NIH was "cutting off any other hypothesis" due to "corruption."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the Alzheimer's Association has called this "demonstrably false."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In reality, over the most recent 10 years available (2014-2023), &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://iadrp.nia.nih.gov/visualization?t=&amp;amp;disease_op=or&amp;amp;class_op=or&amp;amp;class%5B%5D=73737&amp;amp;p_title=&amp;amp;p_num=&amp;amp;p_type_op=or&amp;amp;fun_year=&amp;amp;pi_ln=&amp;amp;pi_fn=&amp;amp;a_org_op=or&amp;amp;a_country_op=or&amp;amp;f_org_op=or&amp;amp;f_org%5B%5D=59956&amp;amp;f_country_op=or&amp;amp;field_program_official_op=or&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_f_year%3A2023&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_f_year%3A2022&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_f_year%3A2021&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_f_year%3A2020&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_f_year%3A2019&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_f_year%3A2018&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_f_year%3A2017&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_f_year%3A2016&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_f_year%3A2015&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_f_year%3A2014&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_class%3A73737&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_f_org%3A59956&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_p_type%3A733&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_disease%3A19045&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_class%3A73776&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_class%3A73777&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_class%3A73778&amp;amp;f%5B%5D=fa_class%3A73779&amp;amp;plot_by=projects&amp;amp;summarized=therapeutic_target_name&amp;amp;refine_by=total&amp;amp;chart_type=pie" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:less than 14%;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;less than 14%&lt;/a&gt; of new National Institutes of Health (NIH) Alzheimer’s projects focused on amyloid beta as the therapeutic target," the organization &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.alz.org/news/2025/kennedy-harmful-myths-alzheimers-dementia-research" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:wrote;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;, "As of September 2024, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/ongoing-AD-trials" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the National Institute on Aging;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;the National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt; was investing in 495 pharmacological and non-pharmacological trials.

&lt;h2&gt;Bilious blowout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors noted that his breath was fast and shallow, with crackling in his neck. But breathing sounds from the base of his right lung were quiet. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed the problems. There was air in his chest space and into his neck. Fluid was also building up around his lungs, and his right lung was collapsing. The scan also showed a perforation in the esophagus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors inserted a chest tube to remove the fluid, which did not include gastric contents, suggesting the fluid build-up was from chest inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors then did an additional X-ray exam of the esophagus using a water-soluble contrast agent. This clearly revealed a large gash in the man's esophagus resulting from the robust eruption. The imaging also showed the contrast agent leaking out into the man's chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors quickly sent the man into emergency surgery to repair his esophagus. He spent the next 35 days in the hospital recovering. When he was discharged, he still had a feeding tube that passed through his nose and into his small intestine. It took an additional three months for the perforation to completely heal, at which point doctors could finally remove the feeding tube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not entirely clear what causes Boerhaave syndrome. Researchers hypothesize that it occurs from a loss of neuromuscular coordination, which, in particular, causes the upper sphincter in the esophagus—the cricopharyngeus—to fail to relax at the onset of vomiting. The rapid rise of internal pressure overwhelms the esophagus, typically causing a lengthwise tear in the lower third of the tube, which is the weakest portion. On average, tears can be up to 8 centimeters (about 3 inches) long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though researchers expect that cases are underreported, the estimated incidence based on reports is about three cases per million people globally each year.&lt;/p&gt;

Rodgers, a reproductive endocrinologist at the Fertility Centers of Illinois who was not involved with the recent AI case. “I was pleasantly shocked by the findings.

Johns Hopkins notes&lt;/a&gt; if the infection becomes persistent or more severe due to a weakened immune system, HPV can cause cancers later in life, including anal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk of developing anal cancer is around one in 500, according to the &lt;a target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/anal-cancer.html"&gt;American Cancer Society.&lt;/a&gt; The site noted that this number was particularly high among white and Hispanic women over the age of 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anal cancer symptoms can be similar to those of hemorrhoids and anal fissures, sometimes making it harder to diagnose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The main symptoms are bleeding from the anus, itching and pain, as well small lumps around and inside your bottom and a discharge of mucus and inconsistent stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The idea is to catch this early with early detection anal pap smears and full anoscopy with an appropriate anal practitioner,' Dr. Goldstein explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The more we talk about anal health and standardize yearly evaluations, similar to genecology appointments, the better all of us will be,' he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Goldstein often shares information about anal health, revealing a critical mistake people are making after using the toilet, explaining it could lead to serious health issues over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The leading proctologist says 'traditional wiping' with toilet paper is causing unnecessary damage and is even more concerned about the popularity of using wet wipes to complete the job. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Goldstein described anal warts as 'painful and itchy' and said they can 'lead to bleeding' (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking to &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://shows.acast.com/am-i-doing-it-wrong"&gt;HuffPost for Am I Doing It Wrong?&lt;/a&gt; Dr Goldstein explained that the skin around the anus is sensitive, and wiping with toilet paper can easily lead to irritation, small tears, and long-term damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's a problem that he sees far too often in his clinic, and it's only getting worse as more people rely on wet wipes for a 'cleaner' finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They are so terrible - not only for the environment, but for your hole,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's so many companies out there throwing wipes and I think they should all be banned. I see 90 people a week [in my office], and I would say one-third of all the people coming through are coming in from wet wipe-induced issues.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr Goldstein, wet wipes are soaked in chemicals which can disrupt the microbiome of the area, which can lead to bacterial infections and painful skin conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Imagine getting rid of your persistent fat layers, while gaining girth down under. That's a contemporary equivalent to the fabled fountain of youth, and a special class of weight loss drugs that leverage the GLP-1 hormone - such as Novo Nordisk's Wegovy or Eli Lilly's &lt;a href="https://wccftech.com/eli-lilly-and-company-glp-1-weight-loss-drug-is-much-more-effective-than-novo-nordisk/"&gt;Zepbound&lt;/a&gt; - are now being billed as the conduits for these seemingly miraculous benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the benefit of those who might not be aware, the GLP-1 hormone suppresses hunger and regulates the production of insulin and glucose. After a meal, this hormone raises the level of insulin, which decreases blood glucose levels. Simultaneously, it reduces the rate at which the stomach empties its contents into the small intestine, creating a feeling of fullness and satiation in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk's diabetes-geared Ozempic and obesity-focused Wegovy mimic this process by using the GLP-1 agonist semaglutide, which binds to the GLP-1 hormone receptor, triggering the hormone in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.diabetes.co.uk/news/2024/jun/average-penis-size-in-the-uk-has-risen-due-to-ozempic-data-suggests.html"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Diabetes.co.uk, the average penile length in the United Kingdom has increased by 0.46 inches between 2022 and 2024, increasing from 5.17 inches to 5.63 inches over the period. Incidentally, this timeframe also coincides with the launch of Ozempic/Wegovy in the UK and the drug's subsequent rip-roaring popularity, with many A-class celebrities, including Oprah Winfrey and Elon Musk, jumping onto the proverbial bandwagon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reported increase in penile length is also corroborated by several social media anecdotes &lt;a href="https://www.uniladtech.com/science/news/doctor-explains-ozempic-penis-phenomenon-side-effect-004987-20250623"&gt;gathered&lt;/a&gt; by Unilad Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what might be causing male packages to, um, flourish so to say? Well, some speculate that better blood flow to the male nether regions might be responsible for the apparent elongation in penile length. Others, including Dr Richard Viney, a consultant urological surgeon at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, theorize that this phenomenon might simply be a function of fat removal in the areas adjoining the penis, which would make a given male appendage appear longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic/Wegovy can cause a host of side effects, including nausea, constipation, diarrhea, and &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/update-fdas-ongoing-evaluation-reports-suicidal-thoughts-or-actions-patients-taking-certain-type"&gt;possible suicidal ideation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, one should never take these drugs without a formal medical recommendation. For those already on GLP-1 drugs though, penile bragging rights might be a hefty ancillary benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

These medical conditions are often treated with TRT; how far the therapy is applicable to others who have low testosterone symptoms is more controversial. Healthy men generally only have a “slight decline” in testosterone levels as they age, says Kelly, and only when they’re in their 70s and 80s. Testosterone levels declining earlier and more severely usually happens because of other health issues, like inflammation, obesity and type 2 diabetes. Things in your diet like &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/a-simple-rule-for-a-better-diet"&gt;processed foods&lt;/a&gt; and endocrine-disrupting chemicals found in some plastic packaging can affect testosterone levels too. The important thing is your average level, Kelly stresses, as it changes throughout the day and even between seasons. It’s true that over-exercising can cause your testosterone levels to drop, he says, “but it’s a transient thing”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most cases, Kelly thinks the crucial thing for keeping your testosterone levels up is just a healthy lifestyle: &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-to-start-working-out"&gt;exercising&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/3-simple-rules-for-a-better-diet"&gt;eating well&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-to-sleep-better-according-to-sleep-experts"&gt;sleeping well&lt;/a&gt;. In short, all the things we know we should be doing. An exception where TRT “might be a really useful and beneficial therapy for some men” is to help break the cycle of poor health— because if you’re obese, “and then that lowers your testosterone, your lower testosterone contributes to you not processing sugar and fat as well, so you become more obese.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foster is more bullish about the benefits of TRT. He views the testosterone decline in middle-aged men as akin to menopause in women, and something that lifestyle changes will help, but can’t fix. “You can eat all the &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/zinc-deficiency#:~:text=Zinc%20deficiency%20is%20often%20linked,or%20even%20eczema%2Dlike%20rashes."&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt; and selenium [supplements] you want,” he says, “but it’s not going to make your testicles the same as they were 10 years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cites—as Kelly does—studies that link low testosterone in men to an increased risk of mortality. A healthier lifestyle might push you up to the lower end of what the NHS considers a “normal” testosterone level—about eight nanomoles per litre—but “all those risks associated with your health aren’t going to suddenly resolve.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s very wary, though, about prescribing TRT to younger men under 30 who don’t have an obvious medical condition. Your natural testosterone levels “keep going higher each year to the age of 30ish,” he says. “If we start disrupting this when you’re 22, how do I know I’m not causing damage for when you’re 40, 50, 60?” He finds the trend of under-30s getting on TRT, especially in the &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/zinc-deficiency#:~:text=Zinc%20deficiency%20is%20often%20linked,or%20even%20eczema%2Dlike%20rashes."&gt;bodybuilding&lt;/a&gt; world, absolutely terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obsession in some corners of the internet with maximizing your testosterone can lead to some weird habits. On Reddit’s &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/Testosterone/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Testosterone/"}' href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Testosterone/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dedicated testosterone forum&lt;/a&gt;, one user offers a unique prescription: “Carnivore diet. Semen retention (no porn). Heavy lifting. Lots of sunlight exposure… especially on the testicles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Kelly tells me, it’s a minefield out there. Abstaining from masturbation has been proved to raised testosterone only among “a handful of people”—and that has to be weighed against the much clearer benefits of regular orgasm. If you’re concerned about low testosterone, d&lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/joe-holder-exercise-snack-short-workout"&gt;o get in shape&lt;/a&gt; and get your diet sorted, and possibly, depending on your age, consider TRT.

						&lt;p&gt;Matt Cross has a life mission: to train young men to become leaders. Mostly he does that through example. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Cross is a youth hockey coach, raised in Toronto and a Raleigh transplant. “As an athlete, I'm always trying to encourage and teach my athletes to be courageous and be brave and to be responsible,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;After a cancer diagnosis at age 36, he’s added another element to that mission. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Because I work with a lot of families and a lot of young people, it was very easy for me to decide that there was a reason why I was going through this,” he says. “It was very easy for me to look at this as an opportunity to make my family and friends proud and to show young people what you do when you have a really difficult obstacle in your life.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;It was a visit from his father that led Cross to face that obstacle: Testicular cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;His father was having heart problems and trying to understand what was going on. So Cross offered to wear an Apple Watch so they could compare EKG readings. When Cross got an abnormal reading, he promised his dad he’d check with a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Cross had another question ready for that appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/matt-cross-cancer-wral-june-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/matt-cross-cancer-wral-june-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“While I was getting my physical, I said, ‘Hey, you know, why don't you check out this lump,’” he recalls. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“I had a lump on my testicle that was there for a number of months, and – typical guy – I figured I'd go to the doctor when I had a real reason to go to the doctor,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;His dad and the abnormal EKG provided that reason.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The answer came on Christmas Day 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“I was stage 2B. Stage 2B means that the cancer originated in the testicle,” Cross says. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/matt-cross-cancer-wral-june-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/matt-cross-cancer-wral-june-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Testicular cancer is the number one most common cancer for men ages 15 to 35. The standard treatment is removal of the testical that contains the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;As a coach, Cross understood being in the fight, but he was looking for a win. Aware of the tradition of cancer survivors ringing a bell to signify that they had reached remission, Cross was disappointed when at first he didn’t see a bell at his doctor’s office.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;He endured two surgeries and three cycles of chemotherapy, a total of 15 full days of infusions.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“The story goes, when I came in for my very last day of treatment, they had installed a bell,” he says. “So I was able to have a celebration and ring it.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“As a cancer patient and survivor, you learn to celebrate all the wins, the small ones, the big ones,” Cross says.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;It’s that message he’s shared with his players and their parents.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Cancer is all sorts of life lessons kind of thrown at you all at once,” Cross says. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“For a lot of people, it's devastating, and you're sick and you're literally just trying to survive. But if you can somehow get to that place where you're learning and you're growing and you're helping other people, I really think that's the way that you should try to go.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“The most amazing thing that ever happened to me was getting sick. It's nuts. No pun intended.” &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Cross was surrounded by support from the hockey community throughout his fight.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/matt-cross-cancer-wral-june-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/matt-cross-cancer-wral-june-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;He recalls, “That looked like emails, phone calls, texts, food gift cards, a GoFundMe. A lot of the local hockey teams taped their sticks purple and put ribbons on their jerseys.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;That support notched up the pressure for Cross to get well. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“It was really a big part of my fight; I can't let these people down,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;In remission for five years, Cross has returned to his mission of modeling leadership. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;A year to the day after his diagnosis, Cross launched the Raleigh Testicular Cancer Foundation. The goal is specifically to raise awareness and to educate about testicular cancer, and generally to get men to pay attention to their own health. &lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;“Our slogan for our charity is Check Your Acorns. That's kind of like a clever, cute way to encourage men and young people to perform self checks,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We're trying to tear down stigmas so that men book that doctor's appointment and that annual physical.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Cross points to the widespread acceptance and awareness of the need for self-exams for breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Men need that extra nudge, he says, to understand the risks of ignoring their bodies’ warning signs. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“It's not about being masculine and being strong,” he says, “it's about saving your life, potentially. The cure rates for cancer when you find them in stage one are significantly higher.”&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;h2&gt;Diagnosis: Young. The New Face of Cancer in NC&lt;/h2&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt; "Diagnosis: Young. The New Face of Cancer in NC" is the latest investigative documentary from the WRAL Doc unit, exploring the alarming trend of cancer striking younger adults in North Carolina and across the nation. The documentary follows three North Carolinians in their 20s and 30s who never expected a cancer diagnosis so early in life. Behind every personal story is the big question: Why is this happening?  &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We spend a third of our lives asleep. And a quarter of our time asleep is spent dreaming. So, for the average person alive in 2022, with a life expectancy of around &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mortality-and-global-health-estimates/ghe-life-expectancy-and-healthy-life-expectancy"&gt;73&lt;/a&gt;, that clocks in at just over six years of dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, given the central role that dreaming plays in our lives, we still know so little about why we dream, how the brain creates dreams, and importantly, what the significance of our dreams might be for our health – especially the health of our brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My 2022 study, published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet's&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00370-4/fulltext"&gt;&lt;em&gt;eClinicalMedicine&lt;/em&gt; journal&lt;/a&gt;, showed that our dreams can reveal a surprising amount of information about our brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More specifically, it showed that having frequent bad dreams and nightmares (bad dreams that make you wake up) during middle or older age, may be linked with an increased risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dementia/symptoms/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fda-approved-sleeping-pill-slows-alzheimers-tangles-in-pre-clinical-trial?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;FDA-Approved Sleeping Pill Slows Alzheimer's Tangles in Pre-Clinical Trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, I analyzed data from three large US studies of health and aging. These included over 600 people aged between 35 and 64, and 2,600 people aged 79 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the participants were dementia-free at the start of the study and were followed for an average of nine years for the middle-aged group and five years for the older participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the study (2002-12), the participants completed a range of questionnaires, including one which asked about how often they experienced bad dreams and nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143068" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nightmare_hands.jpg" alt="man in bed surrounded by hands" class="wp-image-143068 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nightmare_hands.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nightmare_hands-600x325.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143068" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Frequent nightmares could be a sign of declining mental health. (Kirk Marsh/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I analyzed the data to find out whether participants with a higher frequency of nightmares at the beginning of the study were more likely to go on to experience cognitive decline (a fast decline in memory and thinking skills over time) and be diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Weekly nightmares&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found that middle-aged participants who experienced nightmares every week, were four times more likely to experience cognitive decline (&lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12704"&gt;a precursor to dementia)&lt;/a&gt; over the following decade, while the older participants were twice as likely to be diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the connection between nightmares and future dementia was much stronger for men than for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, older men who had nightmares every week were five times more likely to develop dementia compared with older men reporting no bad dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In women, however, the increase in risk was only 41 percent. I found a very similar pattern in the middle-aged group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, these results suggest frequent nightmares may be one of the earliest signs of dementia, which can precede the development of memory and thinking problems by several years or even decades – especially in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, it is also possible that having regular bad dreams and nightmares might even be a cause of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the nature of this study, it is not possible to be certain which of these theories is correct (though I suspect it is the former).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, regardless of which theory turns out to be true – the major implication of the study remains the same, that is, that having regular bad dreams and nightmares during middle and older age may be linked to an increased risk of developing dementia later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that recurring nightmares are &lt;a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.7178"&gt;treatable&lt;/a&gt;. And the first-line medical treatment for nightmares has already been shown to decrease the build-up of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458012004666?via%3Dihub"&gt;abnormal proteins&lt;/a&gt; linked to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143082" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143082" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642.jpg" alt="Illustration of yellow clumps on pink nerve cells" class="size-full wp-image-143082" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642-621x415.jpg 621w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143082" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Abnormal clumps of amyloid-beta proteins are linked to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="165966" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADq3y9cbGY/"&gt;Science Photo Library/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have also been &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.803220/full"&gt;case reports&lt;/a&gt; showing improvements in memory and thinking skills after treating nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that treating nightmares might help to slow cognitive decline and to prevent dementia from developing in some people. This will be an important avenue to explore in future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next steps for my research include investigating whether nightmares in young people might also be linked to increased dementia risk. This could help to determine whether nightmares cause dementia, or whether they are simply an early sign in some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also plan to investigate whether other dream characteristics, such as how often we remember our dreams and how vivid they are, might also help to determine how likely people are to develop dementia in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research might not only help to shed light on the relationship between dementia and dreaming, and provide new opportunities for earlier diagnoses – and possibly &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30367-6/fulltext"&gt;earlier interventions&lt;/a&gt; – but it may also shed new light on the nature and function of the mysterious phenomenon that we call &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-do-we-dream/"&gt;dreaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/191016/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrer-policy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

A study by Queen Mary University of London found drinking a cup of beetroot juice each day could significantly lower the blood pressure of &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/professor-says-underrated-powerhouse-food-31935659" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;people suffering from hypertension.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study saw patients who suffer from high blood pressure drink a 250ml glass of purple juice every day, by the end of the timeframe the study found a significant reduction into that of a "normal range".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking at the study, the &lt;a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/what-we-do/news-from-the-bhf/news-archive/2015/january/beetroot-and-blood-pressure" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;British Heart Foundation added&lt;/a&gt;: "This study, involving 64 volunteers, provides the first evidence of a long-lasting reduction in blood pressure by supplementing the diet with nitrates in patients with high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The level of reduction was similar to that from some forms of &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/consultant-cardiologist-says-small-step-31924230" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;blood pressure medication&lt;/a&gt;. No adverse side effects were observed in people taking the daily dose of nitrates, in the form of beetroot juice."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beetroot isn't the only vegetable high in nitrates, leafy green such as spinach, kale and lettuce as well as carrots, celery, and leeks can all be a great way of including the compound in your diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31117833" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;p&gt;Professor Amrita Ahluwalia, who led the research, added: “This research has proven that a daily inorganic nitrate dose can be as effective as medical intervention in reducing blood pressure and the best part is we can get it from beetroot and other leafy green vegetables.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For those looking to work dietary nitrate into their daily diets, the trick is not to boil the vegetables – as dietary nitrate is water soluble – but steaming, roasting or drinking in a juice all has a positive effect.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The idea of using a natural product instead of medication may be appealing to many, but both the charity and the researcher stressed that more research with a much larger sample size needs to be done before it is used as an official solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 12:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxPbW1PZmh2TjJ4bWRZb1JrTXRod0V0dDgwN0hyTFZBVy1ielQ4OGxsTnI1VGJHVjRjdm1JTmJ0M254bDdfUWkzQlNjaEcwM2VRa2huRUxsOHZIdHpaaUJOdzJZTXpxdWVWcXIyVVU3Um1jbGY1X3M1WTFIcHF1TnBjR0VJanA</guid></item><item><title>疏通动脉的胆固醇超级食物“优于阿司匹林”医生说- Daily Express | Cholesterol superfood that unclogs arteries is 'better than aspirin' doctor says - Daily Express</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix hR new-style"&gt;&lt;div class="photo changeSpace"&gt;&lt;p class="withoutCaption"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/1200x712/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.avif?r=1751030776997" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/1200x712/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.webp?r=1751030776997" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/1200x712/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.jpg?r=1751030776997" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/674x400/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.avif?r=1751030776997" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/674x400/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.webp?r=1751030776997" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/674x400/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.jpg?r=1751030776997" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/940x/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.avif?r=1751030776997" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/940x/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.webp?r=1751030776997" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/940x/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.jpg?r=1751030776997" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/590x/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.avif?r=1751030776997" media="screen"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/590x/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.webp?r=1751030776997" media="screen"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/590x/secondary/Female-hands-with-pills-on-background-of-water-glass-6256810.jpg?r=1751030776997" alt="Female hands with pills" title="Female hands with pills"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="newsCaption"&gt;The superfood has been shown to work well at keeping arteries clear, similarly to aspirin &lt;span class="caption"&gt;(Image: Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A health expert has identified a specific superfood that he claims clears arteries "better than aspirin". Dr Eric Berg DC, a ketosis specialist and renowned health educator with 13.5 million subscribers on his &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" title="YouTube" href="/latest/youtube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; channel, has shared the benefits of this 'number one' food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining clear and healthy arteries is crucial. &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/life-style/health/2041306/cholesterol-go-down-seven-days-you-follow-experts-meal-plan"&gt;Clogged arteries restrict blood flow&lt;/a&gt;. When arteries are unobstructed, blood circulates more efficiently, delivering oxygen and nutrients to vital organs and reducing the risk of various health problems, such as &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" title="Heart attack" href="/latest/heart-attack"&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;, strokes, and other &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" title="Heart Disease" href="/latest/heart-disease"&gt;heart-related complications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-top-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/atherosclerosis/" target="_self" rel="Follow nofollow"&gt;Atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt; is a condition characterised by an excessive buildup of plaque in the arteries, leading to complete blockage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this occurs in the coronary arteries, it can trigger a heart attack, while blockage in the brain's arteries &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/uk/2025195/just-one-minute-week-could-slash-your-risk-stroke-almost-50"&gt;can cause a stroke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ovp-primis"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The substance accumulating in blocked arteries is referred to as atheroma or plaque. It primarily consists of surplus 'bad' cholesterol (LDL cholesterol), fatty substances, cellular waste, calcium, and fibrin (a clotting aid), reports &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/doctor-says-cholesterol-lowering-food-31946538" rel="nofollow"&gt;Surrey Live&lt;/a&gt;.

This period is inherently riskier due to a surge in cortisol and adrenaline, which can increase blood clotting. It’s the body's natural morning changes like higher blood pressure and heart rate, coupled with an enhanced chance of clotting, that amplify the threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his video titled: "#1 Best Food to Unclog Arteries", accompanied by a thumbnail proclaiming: "Better than aspirin", Dr Berg told viewers: "Find out about the number one best food in the world to help unclog arteries and prevent

id="newsletter-place"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The main causes of arterial blockages include:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An abundance of "bad" cholesterol (LDL) can lead to worrying plaque formation in our arteries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elevated blood pressure, notorious for its damaging effect on artery walls, creates a fertile ground for further plaque buildup.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smoking pushes toxins into the bloodstream, injuring artery walls and fuelling inflammation, which, in turn, encourages plaque to form.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diabetes' impact on blood vessel health is profound, with high sugar levels increasing the danger of plaque accumulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obesity adds fuel to the fire, sparking high cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, and diabetes—all of which contribute to the menace of clogged arteries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A sedentary lifestyle can trigger a cascade of issues, including weight gain and increased cholesterol and blood pressure, all enemy agents in the fight against arterial health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your immediate family members have been diagnosed with heart disease, you may be at a higher risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As you age, the probability of developing atherosclerosis increases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persistent stress can trigger inflammation, which can exacerbate plaque accumulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can aspirin aid in unclogging arteries?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link"

rel="nofollow"&gt;Aspirin can help with clogged arteries&lt;/a&gt;, but it doesn't directly treat the blockage. It's an antiplatelet medication that prevents blood clots from forming in narrowed arteries, which could lead to heart attacks or strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspirin doesn't eliminate the plaque causing the blockages. Instead, it helps manage the risk of complications resulting from these blockages. Doctors often recommend aspirin for people who already have heart disease or are at high risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke, particularly after undergoing procedures like angioplasty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, aspirin isn't suitable for everyone, especially those without a history of heart disease or those at an increased risk of bleeding. It's crucial to seek advice from a healthcare professional before starting aspirin therapy, as it can cause side effects such as stomach bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="photo changeSpace"&gt;&lt;p class="withoutCaption"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/1200x712/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.avif?r=1751030783662" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/1200x712/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.webp?r=1751030783662" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/1200x712/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.jpg?r=1751030783662" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/674x400/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.avif?r=1751030783662" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/674x400/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.webp?r=1751030783662" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/674x400/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.jpg?r=1751030783662" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/940x/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.avif?r=1751030783662" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/940x/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.webp?r=1751030783662" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/940x/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.jpg?r=1751030783662" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/590x/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.avif?r=1751030783662" media="screen"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/590x/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.webp?r=1751030783662" media="screen"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/590x/secondary/Front-view-of-many-fish-oil-capsules-spilling-out-from-the-bottle-surrounded-by-an-assortment-of-food-rich-in-omega-3-6256814.jpg?r=1751030783662" alt="fish oil capsules spilling out from the bottle" title="fish oil capsules spilling out from the bottle" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="newsCaption"&gt;EPA not only suppresses atherosclerotic development but also stabilises atherosclerotic plaque &lt;span class="caption"&gt;(Image: Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whatsapp-group "&gt; &lt;strong class="wapp-head"&gt; Get top stories from The Express sent straight to your phone &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class="wapp-btn" href="https://www.express.co.uk/whatsapp-group-web/11?utm_source=article_widget&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article_widget&amp;amp;utm_content=whatsapp-group-signup-in-article"&gt;Join us on WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wapp-inf"&gt;Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.

Dr Berg recommends eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an omega-3 fatty acid, as a natural alternative that doesn't carry the same negative impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EPA is recognised for its ability to &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/17290-omega-3-fatty-acids#:~:text=Omega%2D3%20fatty%20acids%20are,)%2C%20flaxseed%20and%20chia%20seeds." rel="nofollow"&gt;reduce triglyceride levels&lt;/a&gt;, a type of fat found in the blood. High triglycerides can increase the risk of heart disease. EPA can help decrease non-HDL cholesterol, which includes LDL (the harmful kind) and other detrimental cholesterol particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405457724001992#:~:text=last%2010%20years.-,Results,associated%20with%20atherosclerotic%20plaque%20rupture." rel="nofollow"&gt;EPA helps prevent blocked arteries by making your platelets less sticky&lt;/a&gt;. Research has shown that EPA can thin the blood comparably to low-dose Aspirin," says Dr Berg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7023944/#:~:text=Staining%20of%20the%20aorta%20revealed,content%20with%20less%20macrophage%20infiltration." rel="nofollow"&gt;EPA can stabilise vulnerable arterial plaques&lt;/a&gt; by decreasing inflammation. &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7308541/" rel="nofollow"&gt;A 2019 study&lt;/a&gt; found that individuals who consumed EPA saw a significant reduction in plaque, decreased inflammation, and fewer cardiovascular events. It can also positively influence your mood by reducing cortisol and adrenaline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Berg cites salmon, mackerel, fatty fish, and fish oil as some of the best sources of EPA. However, he suggests there's an even superior source. "Cod liver oil or cod liver is the best food to unclog your arteries naturally," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British Heart Foundation highlights oily fish such as salmon, mackerel, herring, sardines, and anchovies as excellent sources of EPA. Cod liver oil, oysters, and certain white fish and shellfish also contain EPA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plant-based alternatives like flax seeds, chia seeds, and walnuts provide ALA, which the body can convert into EPA, albeit not as efficiently as obtaining EPA directly from fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="photo changeSpace"&gt;&lt;p class="withoutCaption"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/1200x712/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.avif?r=1751030783670" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/1200x712/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.webp?r=1751030783670" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/1200x712/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.jpg?r=1751030783670" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/674x400/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.avif?r=1751030783670" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/674x400/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.webp?r=1751030783670" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/674x400/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.jpg?r=1751030783670" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/940x/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.avif?r=1751030783670" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/940x/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.webp?r=1751030783670" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/940x/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.jpg?r=1751030783670" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/590x/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.avif?r=1751030783670" media="screen"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/590x/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.webp?r=1751030783670" media="screen"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/11/590x/secondary/Atherosclerosis-stages-illustration-6256815.jpg?r=1751030783670" alt="Atherosclerosis stages, illustration" title="Atherosclerosis stages, illustration" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="newsCaption"&gt;Blocked arteries put you at high risk of various medical conditions &lt;span class="caption"&gt;(Image: Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Berg adds: "Along with EPA, cod liver oil contains vitamins A and D. The active form of vitamin A, retinol, aids in repairing the body's internal tissues. It's also a potent anti-inflammatory and can help decrease atherosclerotic plaque."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2015 animal study titled: "Aspirin enhances protective effect of fish oil against thrombosis and injury‐induced vascular remodelling," notes: "Although aspirin is commonly used to prevent ischaemic events in patients with coronary artery disease, many patients fail to respond to aspirin treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dietary fish oil (FO), containing ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), has anti‐inflammatory and cardio‐protective properties, such as lowering cholesterol and modulating platelet activity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3331709/#:~:text=These%20data%20suggest%20that%20EPA,inflammation%20and%20angiogenesis%20than%20aspirin." rel="nofollow"&gt;Another study concludes that EPA can be more beneficial&lt;/a&gt;, stating: "EPA+DHA has more pronounced down-regulatory effects on inflammation and angiogenesis than aspirin."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While recent studies indicate optimistic outcomes, the efficacy of omega 3 has garnered varying results, thereby necessitating more research. Some authorities argue that omega 3 hasn't yet matched aspirin's effectiveness, and they caution against discontinuing aspirin without the go-ahead from your cardiologist or alternate recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Berg added to the discussion, emphasising vitamin D's merit based on research: "&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537021002777" rel="nofollow"&gt;In one study&lt;/a&gt;, out of 1000 compounds, vitamin D was the most effective at preventing damage to the internal layer of the arteries. Vitamin D increases nitric oxide and the stiffness of the arteries. It's a potent anti-inflammatory, stabilises plaque, prevents rupture, and decreases arterial calcification."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) fish oil is generally deemed harmless for the majority when ingested in recommended doses. Nonetheless, it's crucial to be mindful of potential adverse effects and drug interactions, especially concerning certain medications or pre-existing medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consulting your healthcare provider before starting fish oil supplements is critical to confirm their safety and appropriateness for you, particularly if you have any health complications or are under medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 12:46:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>营养师说这是服用维生素的最佳时机-预防 | Dietitians Say This Is the Best Time to Take Vitamins - Prevention</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxPLXhqaTlTVVJXTXRfeURMZm5QTGYxdTFKVnF1ZlFtd2pfb3RSdnZTOWpuSXFIYThReXU4RjFxRUpsdHNaSDRoRVYtOG1qWW5IV0c5Q2pnYUh2MVRHSGdTQUd2WFhtRnBoQlFvY3NueHRrWjNTOG9RSDdxNmhXU201N2hGeUNmT1JZQWpPOUViMkFrcjFoUEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-zl6cs0 et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;br data-node-id="1.0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="body-dropcap css-kixdy8 emevuu60"&gt;You’ve thought about the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a63942820/best-time-of-day-take-probiotics/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/a63942820/best-time-of-day-take-probiotics/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="best time to take probiotics" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;best time to take probiotics&lt;/a&gt;, so the natural next question is: When is the best time to take vitamins?

Different nutrients are absorbed better at specific times of day. “For example, water-soluble vitamins like vitamin C and B vitamins can be taken any time of the day, as long as it works for you, but they’re often best absorbed on an empty stomach,” she continues. “On the other hand, fat-soluble vitamins like vitamins A, D, E, and K are better taken with a meal that contains healthy fats to help with absorption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Some vitamins have immediate effects that make them better suited for morning or night. For example, vitamin B12 (often an ingredient in energy drinks) is usually better taken in the morning, “because it plays a key role in energy production and may help reduce feelings of fatigue,” says Manaker. “On the other hand, magnesium is commonly taken in the evening as it has a calming effect on the body, helping to relax muscles and support a good night’s sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Most importantly, the best time to take your vitamins is whenever you can remember to take them consistently, adds &lt;a href="https://culinahealth.com/founders-tamar-samuels/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://culinahealth.com/founders-tamar-samuels/&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1750880351267000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1odaIZhFbu4osF8GqMNpf8" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://culinahealth.com/founders-tamar-samuels/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tamar Samuels, R.D." data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Tamar Samuels, R.D.&lt;/a&gt;, founder and head of clinical partnerships at Culina Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="10" data-lazy-id="P0-14"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Types of vitamins and when to take them" data-anchor-id="types-of-vitamins-and-when-to-take-them" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emt9r7s1"&gt;Types of vitamins and when to take them&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The timing and how you take vitamins can vary depending on whether they are water-soluble or fat-soluble. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="12" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;Fat-soluble vitamins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Fat-soluble vitamins, including &lt;strong data-node-id="13.1"&gt;vitamins A, D, E, and K&lt;/strong&gt;, rely on fat to absorb properly, “which is why pairing them with a meal containing healthy fats, like avocado, nuts, or olive oil, can be beneficial,” says Manaker.

Others might take them in the evening if it’s easier to remember.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Again, if yours contains energizing vitamins like B12, mornings might be a better choice, Manaker adds.  Many people take theirs with a meal to avoid an upset stomach. “If you take iron or magnesium in your multivitamin, avoid pairing it with calcium-rich foods (like milk or cheese), which can compete for absorption,” recommends Samuels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="23" data-lazy-id="P0-15"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Should you take vitamins with food?

However, water-soluble vitamins (like B and C) don’t require fat for absorption and can sometimes be taken on an empty stomach. “That said, taking vitamins with food generally helps reduce the chance of any stomach discomfort,” says Manaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="25" data-lazy-id="P0-16"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Should you take vitamins, period?

As with any supplement, you should only be taking vitamins if you’ve been diagnosed with a deficiency. Otherwise, you can make sure you’re getting the right balance of them through a well-rounded diet of fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, and lean proteins (see: the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/diets/a30326160/mediterranean-diet/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/diets/a30326160/mediterranean-diet/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mediterranean diet" data-node-id="26.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Getting nutrients from food is best because whole foods provide fiber, phytonutrients, and other compounds that supplements can’t replicate,” says Manaker. “However, vitamins can be a smart option for people with specific nutrient deficiencies, dietary restrictions, or increased nutrient needs (like during pregnancy). Lab work, guidance from a dietitian, or monitoring your overall wellness can help identify if supplements could support your health goals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Both Manaker and Samuels recommend looking for supplements that are third-party tested for purity and potency, and avoiding falling for social media trends that may encourage you to stray from your prescribed regimen.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="29.0"&gt;Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet.

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the &lt;strong&gt;Yunnan Province&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;China&lt;/strong&gt; has become a focal point for scientific research due to its &lt;strong&gt;diverse ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt; and proximity to both wildlife and human populations. As researchers explore the rich biodiversity of the region, new discoveries continue to emerge, many of which are unsettling. Among the most concerning findings are newly identified &lt;strong&gt;viruses&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;bats&lt;/strong&gt;, which may pose a significant risk to both &lt;strong&gt;human health&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;livestock&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;New Viruses Discovered&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A team of international researchers recently analyzed &lt;strong&gt;kidney tissue samples&lt;/strong&gt; from 142 bats collected between 2017 and 2021 in &lt;strong&gt;Yunnan&lt;/strong&gt;. Their work, published in&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1013235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, led to the identification of &lt;strong&gt;22 previously unknown viruses&lt;/strong&gt;. Among these, &lt;strong&gt;two viruses&lt;/strong&gt; stood out due to their genetic similarities to &lt;strong&gt;henipaviruses&lt;/strong&gt;, the pathogens responsible for deadly outbreaks like &lt;em&gt;Hendra&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Nipah&lt;/em&gt;. These viruses have been linked to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/silent-killers-in-your-home-these-everyday-plastics-linked-to-millions-of-deaths/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="75020" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;human deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in the past, adding a layer of urgency to this new discovery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These two newly identified viruses, named &lt;em&gt;Henipavirus 1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Henipavirus 2&lt;/em&gt;, share a 52% to 57% genetic match with the &lt;strong&gt;henipaviruses&lt;/strong&gt; responsible for past human outbreaks. Researchers are particularly concerned about the potential for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/06/china-strikes-hard-chinese-satellite-pulverizes-starlink-with-a-2-watt-laser-36000-km-from-earth/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="93501" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;transmission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; from bats to humans or livestock. The viruses were found in the bats’ kidneys, an organ associated with &lt;strong&gt;urine production&lt;/strong&gt;. This suggests a possible pathway for transmission through bodily fluids, particularly &lt;strong&gt;urine&lt;/strong&gt;, which could contaminate the &lt;strong&gt;environment&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;fruits&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;water&lt;/strong&gt; consumed by humans or animals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Hotspot for Zoonotic Diseases&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yunnan’s combination of a rich &lt;strong&gt;biodiversity&lt;/strong&gt; and frequent interactions between wildlife and human populations make it an ideal environment for the emergence of &lt;strong&gt;zoonotic diseases&lt;/strong&gt;—those that can jump from animals to humans. Similar conditions in regions like &lt;strong&gt;Malaysia&lt;/strong&gt; have already contributed to past outbreaks of the &lt;strong&gt;Nipah virus&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vinod Balasubramaniam, a molecular virologist at &lt;em&gt;Monash University&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Australia&lt;/strong&gt;, emphasizes the importance of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/02/chinese-scientists-unveil-worlds-most-powerful-spy-camera-capable-of-capturing-faces-from-100-km-away/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="80245" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;enhanced surveillance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;prevention&lt;/strong&gt; in such areas. “These viruses are particularly concerning because they could spread through contaminated food or water,” said Balasubramaniam. “Vigilance is essential to prevent another public health crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Uncovering Hidden Threats&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to the discovery of new viruses, the study also uncovered two new &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/05/new-microbe-on-tiangong-space-station/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="90019" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bacterial species&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and an unknown&lt;strong&gt; single-celled&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;parasite&lt;/strong&gt;. One of the newly identified bacterial species, &lt;em&gt;Flavobacterium yunnanensis&lt;/em&gt;, could also present potential health risks. This highlights the need for broader research into the full range of &lt;strong&gt;microorganisms&lt;/strong&gt; hosted by bats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers suggest that internal organs, such as &lt;strong&gt;kidneys&lt;/strong&gt;, may harbor a broader array of pathogens than previously thought. Most studies have focused on&lt;strong&gt; bat excretions&lt;/strong&gt;, like &lt;strong&gt;saliva&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;feces&lt;/strong&gt;, while neglecting other tissues that might contain important microbial threats. This shift in focus is crucial for understanding how diseases can spread from bats to other species.&lt;/p&gt;

Laura Friedman (D-Glendale) in a statement. “I’m relieved the CDC finally did the right thing — but this never should have happened.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friedman and other advocates for HIV prevention funding sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. last month, warning that proposed cuts to these programs would reverse years of progress combating the disease and cause spikes in new cases — especially in California and among the LGBTQ+ community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter cited estimates from the Foundation for AIDS Research, known as amfAR, suggesting the cuts could lead to 143,000 additional HIV infections nationwide and 127,000 additional deaths from AIDS-related causes within five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles County, which stood to lose nearly $20 million in annual federal HIV prevention funding, was looking at terminating contracts with 39 providers. Experts said the dissolution of that network could result in as many as 650 new cases per year — pushing the total number of new infections per year in the county to roughly 2,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Public Health is grateful for the support and advocacy from the Board of Supervisors, the Los Angeles County Congressional delegation, and all of our community based providers in pushing CDC to restore this Congressionally approved funding,” a spokeswoman for the county’s health department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Looking forward, it is important to note that the President’s FY26 budget proposes to eliminate this funding entirely, and we urge our federal partners to support this critical lifesaving funding,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

has left people 'freaking out' about developing so-called 'Ozempic face', celebrity nutritionist Rose Ferguson told Femail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 49-year-old former model, who is close friends with &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/kate-moss/index.html" id="mol-f34adf00-52d4-11f0-b28d-2386429dcdcd"&gt;Kate Moss&lt;/a&gt; and boasts 116,000 followers on Instagram, reported a rise in the number of her clients who are worried about their face transfroming from these injections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Semaglutide, which is not a targeted drug, does not just cause loss around the stomach and thighs, but the entire body - including the face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This means that, although it has helped millions around the world achieve their weight loss goals, the 'skinny shot' can also famously make users look extremely gaunt over time - a phenomenon critics have unflatteringly labelled 'Ozempic face'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But how exactly does Ozempic manifest? Dermatologists, aestheticians and cosmetic surgeons break down the tell-tale signs to watch for, as more information about the drug's side effects become known. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox mol-style-large"&gt;More visible wrinkles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People using skinny jabs like Ozempic might notice a greater number of wrinkles all over their visage - including on the forehead - as these 'miracle' weight loss treatments &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12036945/Miracle-new-slimming-jabs-leave-jowls.html"&gt;cause a loss of volume in the face&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to New York-based cosmetic dermatologist Dr Michele Green, 'this volume loss can also worsen the appearance of existing fine lines, wrinkles, and skin laxity' and, therefore, contribute to a more 'aged' look with continued use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="femail-ccox mol-style-large"&gt;Eyes sink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts also pointed out how Ozempic can make your eyes look more sunken as a result of rapid weight loss - with people reporting anywher&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking to DailyMail.com, US-based plastic surgeon pointed out a 'hollowing under the eyes' and 'more wrinkles' and fine lines around them as the weight loss drug begins to show results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Noting how the face of Robbie Williams, who &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/article-11198745/Robbie-Williams-says-hes-happy-loosing-weight-celebrates-new-album-release.html"&gt;admitted to taking 'something like Ozempic'&lt;/a&gt; to shed pounds and manage his 'type-2 self-loathing', she added: 'With Robbie, you can see the direct results of weight loss.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Robbie Williams revealed he lost 25lbs on Ozempic (left in 2013 and right last year). Surgeons said the more pronounced lines on his face as well as the hollowing out of the cheeks were signs of Ozempic face&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox mol-style-medium"&gt;Cheeks sag &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When you lose weight over an extended period of time, it allows the skin to &lt;a target="_self" href="/femail/article-13160357/men-swear-Ozempic-changed-lives-lost-waists-shrunk-inches-unexpected-bonus-effect.html"&gt;contract and shrink with the body&lt;/a&gt; - but drugs like Ozempic significantly accelerate the process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while this weight loss reduces facial or subcutaneous fat - as well as making the body leaner - it also leads to loose skin because it hasn't had enough time to retract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This leads to cheeks that &lt;a target="_self" href="/femail/health/article-14780343/Ozempic-skin-wrinkles-Mounjaro-fat-jabs-ANGELA-EPSTEIN.html"&gt;sag or droop&lt;/a&gt;, and is one of the main characteristics of 'Ozempic face'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By depleting the subcutaneous fat, the skin appears thinner, with more wrinkling and often lipstick lines,' New York-based plastic surgeon Dr Barry Weintraub told this website. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="femail-ccox mol-style-medium"&gt;Lips get bigger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the most common symptoms of this condtion include drooping around the cheeks, sunken eyes, and an increased number of wrinkles, a plumper, more pronounced pout can also occur in people who have injectable fillers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/femail/article-14019487/ozempic-face-lip-fillers-warning.html"&gt;Speaking to MailOnline&lt;/a&gt;, aesthetician Kayti Brooks said that 'Ozempic face' makes lip fillers look more pronounced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Fans shared their concerns about whether Sharon (pictured in 2020) was 'ill' following her 3st weight loss after taking Ozempic, because her face was visibly less full &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; The expert - who runs Grey Door Aesthetics in Hove - said: 'Losing weight at the phenomenal rate Ozempic allows will lose the fat all over the body including the face - but overfilled lips will not shrink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Any filler won’t have the support structure of the skin.

An increase in the amount of acid 'can erode your teeth,' Dr Daniel Atkinson, clinical lead at Treated.com, told the paper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finally, Ozempic's appetite-suppression qualities can make it difficult for the body to get the nutrients it requires to maintain healthy teeth.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 08:04:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxNY0FnaXl6NGU4Rkl6dTY5Ym1QYlU1eWpucUUtRS1jQ1hyVHU1M1Y1SEV5ZFh5U3dkSVVPZjdjSWRUT0NIWVdqSS1sOFNwNVlNck9IZXAyN2R0azZwTXVmVHoxaHdNOEliR3N1Yy1OaWVWZ3BoMklJbnJVREJMUVlYVQ</guid></item><item><title>根据肠道健康专家的说法，帮助您排便的最佳补充剂- EatingWell | The Best Supplement to Help You Poop, According to Gut Health Experts - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTFB4bGhuQzB6MnhyaHlTZXgzaTNzSXpRT29oaDNQX1NwMXEybTRkbHNqUlFCSTEtRzB0ZjB0RnFuQi0tNXFfeFV3cWJpQng5NHJfd2l1eGFycGxwVlI1Rkk5X180NkpqNEZBaXdZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Constipation is a common digestive issue that can leave you feeling bloated, sluggish and downright uncomfortable. When stool moves too slowly through the colon, it becomes dry and hard to pass. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Enter: psyllium husk. This supplement, from the herb &lt;em&gt;Plantago ovata&lt;/em&gt;, can help relieve &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7911394/the-fastest-way-to-relieve-constipation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;constipation&lt;/a&gt; and improve gut health. Psyllium husk contains &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt; that absorbs water in the gut and forms a gel-like substance, softening the stool and promoting regular bowel movements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Beyond easing constipation, psyllium husk also feeds beneficial gut bacteria and supports overall digestive health, making it a standout herb for improving bowel regularity and gut health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Contains Soluble Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Psyllium husk contains a highly viscous form of soluble fiber. When a fiber is characterized as viscous, it means it creates a texture that helps pass stool. “When psyllium is mixed with water, it creates a gel-like substance that helps hold water in the stool. This adds more bulk to it and softens it so that it’s easier to pass,” says Emily Lotterhand, M.B.A., RD, LDN. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Supports a Healthy Gut Microbiome &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to its fiber content, Lotterhand says, “Psyllium Husk also acts as a prebiotic, meaning that it feeds the good bacteria in the gut.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A balanced gut microbiome is linked to more regular bowel movements and fewer digestive issues overall.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Promotes Regularity Without Harsh Side Effects &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unlike stimulant laxatives, which can cause cramping or urgency, psyllium husk works with your body’s natural rhythms to improve the movement of stool through your digestive tract. Because it adds bulk and softens stool through water absorption, psyllium husk supports regularity more gently. That means fewer surprises and more consistency when it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-time-of-day-to-poop-11744316" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bathroom habits&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7944613/inflammation-might-be-the-reason-you-cant-poop-heres-what-to-do-about-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Constipation and inflammation&lt;/a&gt; often go hand in hand, especially when stool lingers in the colon.4 Psyllium’s role in softening stool and supporting microbial balance may also help reduce irritation in the digestive tract. Lotterhand adds that psyllium husk “contributes to maintaining the gut lining’s structural integrity and reducing inflammation.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding Psyllium husk is not as easy as increasing fiber more generally in your diet. “Psyllium husk doesn’t naturally occur in the foods we commonly eat, as it comes from the outer coating of seeds from the &lt;em&gt;Plantago ovata&lt;/em&gt; plant,” Lotterhand says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Psyllium husk is found in many over-the-counter supplements and different forms—powders, granules, capsules and liquid form. You can even find psyllium husk wafers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add to smoothies:&lt;/strong&gt; Stir a teaspoon of powder into your morning &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8031503/30-day-smoothie-plan-to-help-you-poop/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;smoothie&lt;/a&gt; for a fiber boost that blends in easily without affecting the flavor. Just be sure to drink it quickly—it thickens over time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mix into baked goods:&lt;/strong&gt; You can add psyllium husk powder to muffin, bread, or pancake batter to increase the fiber content of your favorite recipes. It also acts as a binder, which can help improve the texture of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/category/4251/gluten-free-diet-center/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;gluten-free&lt;/a&gt; baked goods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sprinkle on oatmeal or yogurt:&lt;/strong&gt; Sprinkle a small spoonful of psyllium husk powder over a bowl of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dietitian-hacks-better-oatmeal-11704604" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;oatmeal&lt;/a&gt; or yogurt to add gut-friendly fiber. Follow it with a glass of water to support proper digestion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use in fortified cereals: &lt;/strong&gt;Many high-fiber cereals feature psyllium husk as an ingredient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Psyllium Husk to Your Diet Slowly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re new to psyllium husk, start with a small amount and increase gradually over several days. “If your body isn’t used to the extra fiber, it might lead to bloating, gas, or cramping,” says Lotterhand. Drinking plenty of water is also key. Psyllium husk needs fluid to work effectively and prevent further constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase fiber:&lt;/strong&gt; Aim to include more fiber-rich foods like oats, barley, legumes, fruits, vegetables and seeds in your daily meals. Soluble fibers, in particular, help soften stool and support regular bowel movements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay hydrated:&lt;/strong&gt; Drinking enough water is essential when increasing fiber intake. Without &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-help-this-dietitian-stay-hydrated-11753491" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;adequate fluids&lt;/a&gt;, fiber can worsen constipation by making stool more difficult to pass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move your body:&lt;/strong&gt; Regular physical activity stimulates the muscles in your digestive tract, which can help promote more consistent bowel movements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Even a daily walk can make a difference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage stress:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic stress can disrupt digestion and contribute to constipation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;6 Mindfulness practices, deep breathing and other stress-reduction techniques may help restore gut balance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get enough sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Poor or inconsistent sleep can affect hormone regulation and digestion. Prioritizing rest supports overall gut function and helps keep things moving.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Psyllium husk is a natural, effective fiber that softens stool and supports regular bowel movements while nourishing a healthy gut microbiome. To avoid discomfort, introduce it gradually and stay well hydrated. Along with psyllium, eating more fiber-rich foods, drinking enough water, staying active and managing stress can help keep digestion on track and relieve constipation.

Instead, it controls it through the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMP-activated_protein_kinase"&gt;AMPK&lt;/a&gt; pathway, which works kind of like a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1042/bse0430121"&gt;fuel gauge for cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_165973" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165973" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/CaffeineAnalysis.jpg" alt="Cell division chart" class="wp-image-165973 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/CaffeineAnalysis.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/CaffeineAnalysis-591x415.jpg 591w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/CaffeineAnalysis-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-165973" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers tracked cell division against certain genetic edits. (Alao et al., &lt;em&gt;Microbial Cell&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We already know that AMPK takes care of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrm.2017.95"&gt;some vital jobs&lt;/a&gt; in terms of keeping cells running and helping them resist wear and tear more effectively. Now we also know that caffeine has an effect on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When your cells are low on energy, AMPK kicks in to help them cope, and our results show that caffeine helps flip that switch," &lt;a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/media/news/2025/science-and-engineering/se/caffeine-could-slow-cellular-ageing-new-research-shows-how.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; geneticist and biologist Charalampos Rallis, from QMUL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With caffeine operating the TOR lever through the AMPK enzyme, cells are affected in three different ways, the researchers found: in how they grow, in how they &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-watch-bacteria-fix-their-broken-dna-in-real-time-to-see-exactly-how-it-s-done"&gt;repair their DNA&lt;/a&gt;, and in how they respond to stress. That all adds up to cells that stay healthier for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers interrupted the genetic chain reaction that caffeine triggers, the cells didn't get all of the same health benefits – confirmation of how the compound is working, and perhaps, how we might be able to utilize it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="165970" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; drug metformin is currently &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-diabetes-drug-linked-to-exceptional-longevity-in-women"&gt;being looked at&lt;/a&gt; as a way of keeping us in better shape for a longer period of time, and it too operates through AMPK – suggesting caffeine-based drugs may have a similar effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any kind of medication or treatment is still a long way off however, not least because these findings are from yeast cells rather than human cells. The researchers are still keen to learn more about the precise way caffeine interacts with AMPK and TOR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we can certainly say for now is that more and more studies are showing positive effects from caffeine consumption, whether that's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/caffeine-in-your-blood-may-affect-body-fat-and-diabetes-risk-study-reveals"&gt;losing body fat&lt;/a&gt;, protecting &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-and-tea-each-day-could-be-protecting-your-heart"&gt;against cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-finds-coffee-linked-to-lower-risk-of-dementia-but-theres-a-catch"&gt;keeping dementia at bay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Direct pharmacological targeting of AMPK may serve towards healthspan and lifespan benefits beyond yeasts, given the highly conserved nature of this key regulatory cellular energy sensor," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15698/mic2025.06.852"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15698/mic2025.06.852"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microbial Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

A new nationwide study points to a far less familiar culprit that is increasing at break‑neck speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hospital stays tied to this type of stroke rose 400% between 2005 and 2019. &lt;a href="https://www.brownhealth.org/providers/shadi-yaghi-md"&gt;Shadi Yaghi, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a vascular neurologist at &lt;a href="https://www.brownhealth.org/providers/shadi-yaghi-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brown University&lt;/a&gt;, led the team that reviewed 125,102 records to understand this disturbing trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-strokes-from-cervical-artery-dissection"&gt;Strokes from “cervical artery dissection”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STR.0000000000000457" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cervical artery dissection&lt;/a&gt; happens when the inner lining of a neck artery splits and blood forces its way between the layers, creating a flap that can slow flow or spawn a clot, causing an ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9272308/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;one in four strokes&lt;/a&gt; in adults younger than fifty trace back to an undetected tear, making the condition a top threat during prime working years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tear often follows a car crash, sports collision, or heavy lift, yet even an awkward reach into the backseat can trigger it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New ultrasound and magnetic‑resonance techniques now reveal tiny mural bruises that older scanners missed, so today’s numbers reflect both a true rise and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eyes-serve-as-an-early-warning-system-for-stroke-risk/"&gt;sharper detection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clues-something-is-wrong"&gt;Clues something is wrong&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sudden one‑sided headache or neck pain, sometimes paired with a droopy eyelid, is the classic red flag that emergency clinicians &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dramatic-temperature-changes-linked-to-half-a-million-stroke-deaths/"&gt;learn to spot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some patients hear a pulsing “whoosh” in one ear, a clue that turbulent blood is racing past the tear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When symptoms appear vague, physicians look for Horner’s syndrome, a pinpoint pupil with a partly closed lid, that often accompanies the injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emergency departments rely on computed tomography angiography, a dye scan that maps blood flow in minutes and is now the preferred first test in young &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stroke-risk-is-elevated-by-air-pollution-and-traffic-noise/"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-the-numbers-keep-climbing"&gt;Why the numbers keep climbing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incidence climbed from eleven to forty‑six cases per million people over fifteen years, an average ten‑percent rise every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hispanic and Black Americans saw the steepest gains, nearly doubling the increase noted in white patients, suggesting disparities in both exposure to trauma and access to early vascular care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheaper scanners let smaller hospitals perform &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/peanuts-have-a-beneficial-impact-on-vascular-health/"&gt;vascular&lt;/a&gt; studies on site. Clinicians also scan first and ask questions later, catching tears that once slipped under the radar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Strokes that are not fatal can lead to long‑term disability, poor mental health and reduced quality of life,” stated Yaghi, underscoring why &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stem-cell-therapy-improves-brain-activity-after-stroke/"&gt;earlier diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; matters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sharpest rise occurred in people older than sixty‑five, hinting that age‑related vessel changes and more liberal imaging are uncovering cases once blamed on arthritis pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-recognizing-cervical-artery-strokes"&gt;Recognizing cervical artery strokes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sports medicine papers link dissections to wrestling throws, surfing wipeouts, and yoga headstands that force the neck past its usual range. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A case report describes a thirty‑four‑year‑old woman who suffered a fatal stroke just hours after chiropractic neck manipulation, reminding clinicians to weigh benefits against rare but severe risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with connective‑tissue disorders such as &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ehlers-danlos-syndromes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ehlers‑Danlos syndrome&lt;/a&gt; face extra risk, and studies tie hypertension and migraine with aura to the condition as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vertebral tears demand respect because a nationwide follow‑up study found they almost doubled stroke risk within ninety days even when the first hospital stay ended without brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gaps-in-treatment-and-follow-up"&gt;Gaps in treatment and follow‑up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guidelines favor starting an antiplatelet drug such as aspirin for three to six months, reserving anticoagulants for complicated or vertebral artery dissection that extends toward the brainstem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occlusive tears may call for stronger medication, and many centers reorder imaging within a week to confirm blood is flowing through a safe channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intravenous clot‑busting medicine remains safe when given within the standard window, according to a recent &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.124.039662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Heart Association review&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Endovascular stenting is saved for repeat attacks that break through medication, with observational series reporting technical success in more than ninety‑percent of treated segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tele‑stroke clinics now let rural patients secure follow‑up scans and medication checks without long travel, a shift that could narrow the racial gap seen in the fresh data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lowering-cervical-artery-stroke-risk"&gt;Lowering cervical artery stroke risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wear a seat belt, raise the headrest to eye level, and avoid twisting the neck while lifting heavy objects, even on short trips. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always secure loose cargo so you are not tempted to reach suddenly while driving; it is a small habit that keeps your shoulders, and arteries, out of harm’s way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strength‑training experts advise easing back into weights with lighter loads and steady breathing after imaging confirms healing, guidance drawn from sports case &lt;a href="https://practicalneurology.com/diseases-diagnoses/stroke/bilateral-vertebral-artery-dissection-and-occlusion-after-a-long-distance-open-water-swim/32070/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen to your body. A stubborn one‑sided headache or new neck pain after minor trauma is reason enough to seek medical care, especially if an eye looks different or speech sounds slurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are testing direct oral anticoagulants and ultrasound markers that might spot a weak artery before it fails, while genetic studies hunt for clues in connective‑tissue biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000213548" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 23:22:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxQeW5JUXFQenJSNm5JN3RkWElBWVdiYUFHbGZJTDFKRk4zc1licFR0cHFqZzE3M1lSRWE1NE40Xzl3S2lkbGJrY0lxLWZwdHYwM21DMlEwUmE4SFRvTVNTRWFpMTFjZXZoa2pLWVlBMGZHNFBPWVBlVUtoc2o2dmZMdmNLODJ2ZlBBX3pVYWptR1BwN3ZrOFJjQzFFX2djM29oQU5iUmQ1dVhFd3hG</guid></item><item><title>新药为超罕见遗传性疾病提供了潜在的治愈方法- BBC | New drug offers potential cure for ultra rare inherited condition - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE50UUFlX0lJSkVoR0V3RVdsVmFwZHQ4bmtpbXgwckV0SXgzNGE2NUtMLW9BNXo4NzIyUllndWJVMjJwM3FjSTlKVzExemdQUFZ0eXZCZ2w3el9xQdIBX0FVX3lxTFBSaVpUWWJncFlhMzZEa25MR1V4QmlXT1RiUGJNMWhnZFNYN1ppWWpEMVVqSGNEV3gwQzI5WnZucThRWV9idE1mbFJtSm1XWG9xdXJ4eVVmZ2xmRXNta3dV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Drug for rare disease brings 'joy and hope'&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-801dd632-0 eSlECZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-801dd632-12 jSIeFi"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;Fergus Walsh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 hwLppI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Medical Editor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250616-143050-043f96f72f-web-2.23.1-5/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f843/live/e52fdd60-5286-11f0-9385-f3e2004ea3ca.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f843/live/e52fdd60-5286-11f0-9385-f3e2004ea3ca.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f843/live/e52fdd60-5286-11f0-9385-f3e2004ea3ca.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f843/live/e52fdd60-5286-11f0-9385-f3e2004ea3ca.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f843/live/e52fdd60-5286-11f0-9385-f3e2004ea3ca.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f843/live/e52fdd60-5286-11f0-9385-f3e2004ea3ca.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f843/live/e52fdd60-5286-11f0-9385-f3e2004ea3ca.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f843/live/e52fdd60-5286-11f0-9385-f3e2004ea3ca.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC Mary Catchpole, smiling with her hair tied back and wearing glasses.

It can cause organs and lymph nodes to swell, and the body's immune system to attack healthy tissue. Patients are also at risk of lymphoma, a cancer which affects a type of white blood cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The drug, branded Joenja, is taken twice daily as tablets, and works by blocking the enzyme, allowing the immune system to work normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Jimmy told the BBC: "This is something I have dreamt about since Mary was first diagnosed; it is giving her the chance to live a normal life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Mary suffered regular chest infections as a child and has been repeatedly treated with intravenous antibiotics, nebulisers and immunoglobulin replacement therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She has been taking the leniolisib tablets for less than a month but has already stopped some other medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Chandra, who is Mary's consultant and has treated several other family members, said the drug was a "potential cure".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Mary is rethinking about how she will live in future: "I want to go on more adventures and take risks because all I've ever known is medication, needles, and hospital appointments, whereas now I can find out who I truly am."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The faulty gene is carried on the maternal line so there is a 50:50 chance it will be passed to affected women's children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Mary said she would like to become a dance teacher, while continuing her work as a teaching assistant.

            &lt;p&gt;New York – NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue, in partnership with the NYC Health Department, FDNY, and NYC Emergency Management, participated this week in a large-scale international emergency exercise, Tranquil Passport, to simulate the safe transfer of patients with highly contagious diseases from Canada to U.S. treatment centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong class="whatsapp-promotion-mobile"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the federally designated Regional Emerging Special Pathogen Treatment Center (RESPTC) for Region 2, Bellevue Hospital served as New York City’s receiving site for the drill, which took place in the context of planning for potential public health threats during major global events like the 2026 FIFA World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two simulated patients with fictional high-consequence infectious diseases were flown into LaGuardia Airport and transported in a new federal Portable Biocontainment Unit, which can carry up to 10 patients. FDNY transferred them to Bellevue’s Special Pathogen Unit, where hospital teams practiced full protective protocols, including PPE use, biocontainment, and inter-agency coordination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials from across city, state, and federal levels emphasized the importance of proactive readiness. “Exercises like Tranquil Passport stress-test our systems before a real emergency,” said Dr. Syra Madad, Chief Biopreparedness Officer at NYC Health + Hospitals. Bellevue CEO Dr. Eric Wei added, “This collaboration enhances our ability to protect New Yorkers from future pathogen threats.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simulation also tested patient-family communication, specimen handling, and the hospital’s new communication tools inside the unit. As the only active biocontainment unit in New York City, Bellevue plays a key role in both clinical response and national preparedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This initiative comes as federal funding for emergency health response remains in flux, underscoring the need for robust, ongoing investment in public health. infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Regeneration is a trick many animals, including lizards, starfish, and octopuses, have mastered. Axolotls, a salamander species originating in Mexico, can regrow pretty much everything from severed limbs, through eyes and parts of brain, to the spinal cord. Mammals, though, have mostly lost this ability somewhere along their evolutionary path. Regeneration persisted, in a limited number of tissues, in just a few mammalian species like rabbits or goats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were trying to learn how certain animals lost their regeneration capacity during evolution and then put back the responsible gene or pathway to reactivate the regeneration program,” says Wei Wang, a researcher at the National Institute of Biological Sciences in Beijing. Wang’s team has found one of those inactive regeneration genes, activated it, and brough back a limited regeneration ability to mice that did not have it before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Of mice and bunnies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea Wang and his colleagues had was a comparative study to compare how the wound healing process works in regenerating and non-regenerating mammalian species. They chose rabbits as their regenerating mammals and mice as the non-regenerating species. As the reference organ, the team picked the ear pinna. “We wanted relatively simple structure that was easy to observe and yet composed of many different cell types,” Wang says. The test involved punching holes in the ear pinna of rabbits and mice and tracking the wound-repairing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The healing process began in the same way in rabbits and mice. Within the first few days after the injury, a blastema—a mass of heterogeneous cells—formed at the wound site. “Both rabbits and mice will heal the wounds after a few days,” Wang explains. “But between the 10th and 15th day, you will see the major difference.” In this timeframe, the earhole in rabbits started to become smaller. There were outgrowths above the blastema—the animals were producing more tissue. In mice, on the other hand, the healing process halted completely, leaving a hole in the ear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you eat dairy, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/surprising-ingredient-for-high-protein-vegetarian-meals-8649419" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;strained (Greek-style) yogurt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047800/best-cottage-cheese/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;cottage cheese&lt;/a&gt; can deliver the biggest bang for your buck. In a scant ½-cup serving, Greek-style yogurt delivers 9 to 10 grams of protein, and cottage cheese 11 to 12 grams.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I use Greek-style instead of regular yogurt to make Indian dishes like raita, and it's great in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8051030/chipotle-ranch-dressing/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;salad dressings&lt;/a&gt; too. Cottage cheese is certainly having its moment right now, probably because of its versatility. You can use it to make everything from &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8051435/high-protein-pasta-sauce-with-cottage-cheese/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;pasta sauce&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8039820/high-protein-2-ingredient-cottage-cheese-ice-cream-recipe/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;ice cream&lt;/a&gt;!

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Soy is a go-to in my plant-based-protein pantry because products made from soybeans like tofu and edamame are &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291534/is-tofu-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;complete proteins&lt;/a&gt;, containing all &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/should-you-be-taking-an-essential-amino-acid-supplement-11715877" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;nine essential amino acids&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With 4 to 8 grams of protein per ounce, I keep a variety of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nuts-and-seeds-ranked-by-protein-11758822" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nuts and seeds&lt;/a&gt; in my pantry to cook with and snack on—walnuts, almonds and hemp seeds are some of my favorites.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They not only add crunch to wraps, salads and stir-fries, I like to blend them into smoothies too.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With at least 4 grams per ounce, depending on variety, cheese adds a respectable amount of protein to many dishes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I like to sprinkle pasta with Parmesan and Pecorino, use paneer to make Indian dishes like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/262568/easy-saag-paneer/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;saag paneer&lt;/a&gt;, and incorporate &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-cheeses-to-buy-at-costco-11697490" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;mozzarella, feta, goat cheese&lt;/a&gt; and ricotta into salads, pizza and more.

However, the US saw a higher rate than the Asian country - 1,307 cases per 100,000 people, compared to China's 490 per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, the US has the fifth-highest cancer rate in the world, and cases are climbing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;America made up about 13 percent of the 19 million cases recorded &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13197079/cancer-epidemic-young-people-america-uk-india-south-africa.html"&gt;worldwide in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, more than the combined share from all of Africa (six percent), Latin America and the Caribbean (seven percent), and Oceania (less than two percent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And global diagnoses are only expected to increase, reaching 35million a year by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lung cancer was the most commonly diagnosed among both men and women, responsible for almost 2.5 million new cases, or one in eight cancers worldwide. In the US, an estimated 236,740 new cases of lung cancer were diagnosed, and 130,000 people died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Breast cancer in women made up 12 percent of cases worldwide, colorectal accounted for 10 percent, prostate at seven percent, and stomach at five percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer is now the leading cause of death in Americans under 85, according to the American Cancer Society's 2024 report. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it remains the second-leading cause of death overall in the US, it has surpassed heart disease as the top killer in younger age groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The anticipated spike in new cancer diagnoses is mainly due to population growth and aging, but experts are increasingly blaming environmental toxins and ultra-processed foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And though cancer rates among people under 50 are on the rise, particularly colorectal cancer, the disease still primarily afflicts seniors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This rise in projected cancer cases by 2050 is solely due to the aging and growth of the population, assuming current incidence rates remain unchanged,’ Dr Hyuna Sung, senior principal scientist at the American Cancer Society, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pressroom.cancer.org/GlobalCancerStatistics2024#:~:text=%E2%80%9CNotably%2C%20the%20prevalence%20of%20major,barring%20any%20large%20scale%20interventions.%E2%80%9D"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Notably, the prevalence of major risk factors such as consumption of unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, heavy alcohol consumption, and cigarette smoking are increasing in many parts of the world and will likely exacerbate the future burden of cancer barring any large scale interventions.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts warn that the projected rise in cancer cases by 2050 stems from more than just aging populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Population growth explains part of the increase, but preventable risk factors —poor diet, lack of access to screenings, and chemical exposures — are also driving the disproportionate spikes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the US diagnoses about one in six global cancer cases, it accounts for just seven percent of deaths worldwide, thanks to advanced treatments and fast drug approvals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21834"&gt;reported &lt;/a&gt;that almost half of all cases and about 56 percent of cancer deaths in 2022 occurred in Asia, where over 59 percent of the world’s population lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer death rates in Africa and Asia are much higher than cases, partly because cancers there are often found late and are harder to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Europe has more cancer cases and deaths than expected for its population, making up about 20 percent of global cases and deaths, though it has less than 10 percent of the world’s people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;About 20 million cases of cancer were diagnosed in 2022, but that number is projected to balloon to more than 35 million cases by 2050&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prostate cancer in men is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in 118 countries, followed by lung cancer among both sexes in 33 countries, and liver, colorectal, and stomach cancer ranking in first place in 11, nine, and eight countries, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By 2050, lung cancer cases will climb from about 2.5 million in 2022 to roughly four million. Deaths will also climb from approximately 1.8 million to about three million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Global breast cancer cases are projected to surge from 2.3 million to 3.5 million by 2050, with deaths rising from 666,000 to 1 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women (excluding skin cancer), diagnosed in 157 countries, while cervical cancer leads in 25 others. The US saw 288,000 new cases in 2022, with over 319,000 projected for 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just 10 cancer types cause over 60 percent of all cases and deaths globally. Leading the pack is lung cancer (12.4 percent of cases), followed by breast (11.6 percent), colorectal (9.6 percent), prostate (7.3 percent), and stomach cancers (4.9 percent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorectal cancer cases will skyrocket from 1.9 million to 3 million globally by 2050, fueled by processed diets and rising early-onset cases. In 2023, 19,550 Americans under 50 were diagnosed with CRC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deaths will climb from 904,000 to 1.4 million, especially in regions with poor screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While the US diagnoses about one in six global cancer cases, it accounts for just seven percent of deaths worldwide&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In North America, pancreatic cancer cases and deaths will both increase sharply, with minimal survival improvements expected. Obesity and diabetes are key drivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prostate cancer is set to explode—from 1.5 million cases today to a staggering 2.5 million by 2050—as the world’s population ages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deaths will leap from 397,000 to 600,000, hitting sub-Saharan Africa hardest, where life-saving treatments remain out of reach for millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver cancer cases will rise from 865,000 to 1.2 million. Deaths will remain high, nearing one million, due to late detection in poorer parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s on track to become more common, fueled by America's growing struggles with obesity, diabetes, and heavy drinking—even as hepatitis-linked cases fade. Deaths will climb in lockstep, as most patients are diagnosed too late for effective treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cervical cancer cases could plummet from 660,000 to 500,000 with wider HPV vaccination, yet deaths may persist in Africa without better screening. Meanwhile, North America could nearly eliminate it, thanks to vaccines and early detection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stomach cancer cases will decline slightly due to H. pylori control, but deaths will persist in regions with limited healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pancreatic cancer cases will spike from 511,000 to 800,000, with deaths mirroring this rise due to poor survival rates.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Esophageal cancer cases will grow from 511,000 to 700,000, driven by obesity-related adenocarcinoma in wealthy nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While cases in the US are rising, deaths due to cancer are on the decline thanks to advances in treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists can now engineer immune cells in the lab that target and kill cancer cells, while CRISPR-based gene therapies have progressed&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-6928783/Two-Americans-genes-edited-CRISPR-bid-treat-cancer.html"&gt; from the lab to clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; for people with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Karen E Knudsen, CEO of the American Cancer Society, said: ‘Understanding the global cancer burden is critical to ensuring everyone has an opportunity to prevent, detect, treat, and survive cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This data provides insight into trends and potential areas for intervention and can help prioritize discovery efforts worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 21:38:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxPZU9MelgzcDNtdjBsVE9uRnlqR0ltUVJfVXFiZmQ2RTNjT0M2UlN2d0JsMDdsbjhjTkUxbDRrbDVRMU5iVXlWSUhOR0tra0JPOE92eEsyclVMdE9oVG1uNVRMclhRU0RuSVlSWFFVSVZxaDhuWWplRGJkZnl0UzBmLUFzNDJnQnlObmRZcFIxN0NBR2x1aFVodWJRZ3hsaDRJaldobVFR0gGrAUFVX3lxTE1Tb285aFFFNlRaTXpCbEZKUjFPc0RHTkNkLU1ucWlrZUY4QTZQNjk3dmxzRl9VTGFCbDhtbVkzMnpkc05udWlWdmIzRXp1eWxQd2pXc3hNLTg2NGdhY0dqWEVqdEp2N1pjOUJaY0VUSG1tVXRKcUJRUFBIM3RQaTJ6YkhORXM5M01PY2NCZnc2N0U5Yi1XN3hrRHlmN1R3M21SX2ctTnlUUXlBTQ</guid></item><item><title>在医生将胃部症状视为胃灼热后给予可怕癌症预后的女性- AOL.com | Woman Given Dire Cancer Prognosis After Doctors Dismissed Her Stomach Symptoms as Heartburn - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE80OFRTUGNfZUF0NlRMVm12RFlVWTNVYWo0dEx1TFJ6WjZCNGI4c2pUZGx0djFldlV3M25DMDR5N0Z2TkFWX1E3dWR4Z2o0NW0yUjJ0NVBnbXB1bHNock8wR2lvbzdiSlZyQ3hmN1AyMVNqcWI0VVk0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/p&gt; Georgia-Leigh Gardiner.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NEED TO KNOW&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After months of abdominal pains, Georgia-Leigh Gardiner, a mom living in the United Kingdom, learned she had an aggressive stomach cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 28-year-old has a 2-year-old son named Arlo, who was her first thought when she received her diagnosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;She's planning to start chemotherapy this summer, which she hopes will "potentially slow the growth of the cancer"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Georgia-Leigh Gardiner, a mom living in the United Kingdom, is learning to cope with a devastating diagnosis after suffering months of stomach pains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 28-year-old’s symptoms emerged around Christmastime 2024, when she began experiencing abdominal pains, weight loss and an inability to eat without vomiting, she wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/q4hsec-georgias-story" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoFundMe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; established in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gardiner said she used to be a "massive foodie," but eventually, her body "was just rejecting everything," &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14846239/Mum-heartburn-deadly-cancer.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Daily Mail;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was experiencing pains in my upper stomach. It was really intense, it was a sharp constant pain," she said, per the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gardiner said on GoFundMe that she went “back and forth” with doctors for months and was initially prescribed &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/lansoprazole/#:~:text=1.-,About%20lansoprazole,prevent%20and%20treat%20stomach%20ulcers." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lansoprazole;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lansoprazole&lt;/a&gt;, a medication used to treat heartburn, acid reflux and other stomach conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, she said she was referred to a non-specific symptoms pathway, which according to the UK’s &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/cancer/faster-diagnosis/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Health Service;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Health Service&lt;/a&gt;, helps patients “who do not fit clearly into a single ‘urgent cancer’ referral pathway, but who are nonetheless at risk of being diagnosed with cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wasn’t aware this was a cancer pathway until I went to my appointment,” Gardiner said on her fundraiser, adding that she then underwent an endoscopy through her throat, a procedure in which doctors can look inside patient's digestive system using a camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, June 13, she and her fiancé Callum had a meeting at St. James’s University Hospital, where Gardiner learned she had linitus plastica, an aggressive stomach cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In that room, my whole world crumbled,” Gardiner said, adding that doctor found the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes and other internal organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Then I heard the word ‘incurable’ and all I thought of was Arlo. How can this be happening when I have a 2-year-old son?” Gardiner recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think I even laughed and asked Callum if what they were saying was real,” she added on GoFundMe. “I think I went through every emotion you could think of in the space of 5 minutes. But it is real, and the fact of it is I have stage 4 terminal cancer and I don’t know how long I have left.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She believes the life expectancy for this form of cancer is about a year. Medical research varies, but a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3351946/#B1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:few studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;few studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest the five-year survival rate is about 3-10% for those living with linitis plastica, although others show a &lt;a href="https://ar.iiarjournals.org/content/43/4/1543#:~:text=The%20diagnosis%20of%20gastric%20LP,%E2%80%9D%20%285%2D7%29." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:higher percentage;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;higher percentage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/p&gt; Georgia-Leigh Gardiner.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk: PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m young, I’m healthy other than the weight loss and I’m full of fight.

						&lt;p&gt;According to a release from the county, Animal Control responded to an animal attack in a neighborhood near the corner of Pulley Town Road and Thornburg Drive in Wake Forest. Animal Control officers later captured the fox and tested it for rabies.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The county said that the fox didn’t bite anyone else. The county added that Animal Control would canvas the neighborhood and see if any neighbors need their pets vaccinated, and asked anyone who may have encountered the fox to call the Wake County Communicable Disease line at 919-250-4462.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;This is the fourth rabies bite incident in Wake County this month. &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/news/local/rabid-fox-bites-person-raleigh-june-2025/"&gt;Three different animals, including two foxes, had previously attacked people in Raleigh&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/news/local/cumberland-county-rabies-case-fox-bite-fayetteville-june-2025/"&gt;Fayetteville, a fox attacked a home inspector&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Wake County health leaders provide the following general tips to help minimize rabies risk:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Residents should not approach animals that they do not know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Residents should ensure their pets have a current rabies vaccination. If a pet is allowed outside, a booster vaccine is recommended. Outdoor pets should be kept inside until they receive booster vaccines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not feed stray or unknown animals, including cats and dogs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not leave trash or food outside unless it is in a trash can with a tight-fitting lid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a pet is fed outside, do not leave food out overnight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a pet comes in contact with an animal that might be rabid, contact a veterinarian immediately.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

						Newton, Massachusetts, school leaders have mandated that all students must have their vaccinations up to date before classes resume this fall. A recent review of student vaccination records by Newton Schools' new Superintendent Anna Nolin revealed that 182 students do not have all the state-required vaccinations, including 42 students not fully vaccinated against measles. During the pandemic, some families received waivers for vaccines, but these will no longer be accepted, and students without full vaccinations will not be allowed back in the fall."I'm fine with it. And to be honest with you, I didn't even realize it wasn't there. So we always stuck with our vaccination programs with the doctor and nothing lapsed on our end," one Newton father said.Not everyone is on board. "If I had my choice, I would not vaccinate them at all," one Newton mother said. "I think the vaccines are poison."The unvaccinated students represent about 1.5 percent of Newton's student population. A health expert warned that if these students are grouped together in the same school or neighborhood, it could pose a risk of an outbreak."If you have multiple children in the same grade, for example, and (there's an) introduction of measles because one of those children travels to an area with measles transmission and brings it back, you could get an outbreak and you could get serious illness," said Dr. Shira Doron of Tufts Medical Center.Massachusetts allows families to request an exemption from school vaccination requirements for medical or religious reasons. State lawmakers are considering a bill to eliminate the religious exemption."Several states have gotten rid of them in recent years, including California, Connecticut, Maine and New York, all around here.  So we're hoping to be the next one," said Katie Blair, of Massachusetts Families for Vaccines.

Kennedy Jr. voted Thursday to effectively remove an ingredient from flu shots, achieving a longtime, controversial goal of anti-vaccine activists and illustrating how their priorities are becoming official government guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4TPN48APTT06X23Z856QGVMHG0" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The vote to no longer recommend influenza vaccines that contain the preservative thimerosal, based on the presentation of a single vaccine critic, is likely to have limited impact because the vast majority of flu shots are thimerosal-free. But it would probably make the shots more expensive and harder to receive in parts of the country, public health experts said, and showed the panel’s willingness to disregard scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JZCUMVYMIVGQLODTZWUHEB5KCU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Those experts were surprised that Kennedy’s newly reformulated Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) abruptly added thimerosal to the agenda of its first meeting because they considered the issue resolved decades ago. Staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention prepared a report, later taken offline, showing that the preservative is safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GVVOJMDS2NEDZHYVWAGQM6DZUY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But Kennedy, the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/01/28/rfk-jr-disparaged-vaccines-dozens-times-recent-years-misled-race/?itid=ap_laurenweber_1" target="_blank"&gt;founder of the anti-vaccine advocacy&lt;/a&gt; group Children’s Health Defense, has long criticized the use of thimerosal because it metabolizes into a form of mercury in the body that he says is dangerous. Kennedy edited a book aimed at persuading the CDC to remove thimerosal in any vaccines more than a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NCF6HPEY9N7B9F1HGG8QUAY2CW" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Now Kennedy will be able to enact that ban and is upending other vaccine policies once considered bipartisan and stable, even as administrations changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AASB4XVAMJEVHFGPTRXGHCADOE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The fearmongering and speculation by the mainstream media that this committee would cast doubt on vaccines to promote hesitancy were not just wrong, they were reckless and defamatory,” HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said. “The members of this committee are respected experts who take their responsibility to public health seriously. What they did today is what Secretary Kennedy appointed them to do, which is review the evidence, debate it with scientific rigor, and deliver recommendations rooted in data and medical integrity. The public deserves nothing but this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="R39C9E2PQ16G9FR4C5G6FT6CCW" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;ACIP members appointed by Kennedy spoke out against the use of multidose flu vaccine vials containing thimerosal, arguing that it undermines public confidence in vaccination because of concerns about mercury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FUPW794D854N52C0CUDCXZ1KA0" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Cody Meissner, a pediatrician who was the only panel member to vote no, argued that the move would limit the availability of the influenza vaccine. “The risk from influenza is so much greater than the nonexistent, as far as I know, risk from thimerosal,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ADXMXN10T108N8JABC3P3TCFRG" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The panel’s vote to remove thimerosal followed a presentation from a former leader of Kennedy’s anti-vaccine group who does not have a medical or doctorate degree. Such presentations to ACIP are usually reviewed by&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;experts on the committee’s work groups that spend months researching the data and preparing a detailed cost-benefit analysis, according to liaison members to the ACIP, former members and CDC staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="372UB54VE57NNA0V5KD69KW634" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The early moves by ACIP have alarmed medical societies after Kennedy this month &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/06/09/rfk-ousts-vaccine-advisory-committee-acip/" target="_blank"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; the panel’s 17 members and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/06/11/rfk-cdc-vaccine-committee/" target="_blank"&gt;replaced them&lt;/a&gt; with some &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/06/13/rfk-jr-vaccine-committee-overhaul/" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine critics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TZZ74EVQPN037ER8T7J4DJFAV4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kennedy has said he is working to restore “gold standard” science and integrity in his actions to reform the public health system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="0TFP50CPFT5U33EHJ7EGZ27Q5M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/06/25/rfk-jr-vaccine-panel-acip-meeting/" target="_blank"&gt;panel also said Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; that it would examine the cumulative effect of the childhood vaccine schedule and reevaluate hepatitis B immunization recommendations, moves sought by anti-vaccine activists that could alter how and when the nation’s children receive shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EKUXGR3PFBEIJGCI4H4NFALGIY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;ACIP recommendations guide how clinicians decide which vaccines to administer and to whom and when those vaccines are covered by insurance and distributed through government programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QZ4HU46JMX65NBKR2B7FR4BVE0" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;David Margolius, director of public health for Cleveland, said Kennedy is wasting time going over settled science.

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The biggest factor behind this change in behavior is a decrease in "loss aversion," according to a recent study by University of Arkansas researchers, &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306453024003044" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Psychoneuroendocrinology&lt;/i&gt;. Loss aversion is the human tendency to be more affected by loss than gain. In other words, the pain of losing $100 is greater than the joy of winning $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also discovered that the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/effects+of+stress/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;effects of stress&lt;/a&gt; are different for men and women. In general, stress has a greater impact on men's decision-making. Under stress, women are also better at predicting the outcome of a decision, while men have a better grasp of the consequences of that outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In my own life, if I'm stressed, I'll wait to make a decision that could have potential loss implications," said Grant Shields, assistant professor of psychological science and the study's lead author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zach Gray, a doctoral student in psychology, and Trey Malone, a former U of A agricultural economist now at Purdue University, are also authors on the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, 147 participants were placed under stress and asked to make hypothetical financial decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Financial risk is easy to assess, because people have a pretty good idea about what they would do with their own money," Shields said. "My research was aimed at understanding the component processes that go into that calculus."&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The participants' decisions were analyzed using cumulative prospect theory, which proposes that decisions are driven by four factors: loss aversion, risk &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/aversion/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;aversion&lt;/a&gt;, randomness—or stochasticity—in choices, and probability distortion, which is the tendency to overweight unlikely outcomes and underweight likely outcomes. For example, probability distortion explains why people who buy lottery tickets focus on the small chance of winning rather than the greater likelihood of losing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cumulative prospect theory is widely used by behavioral economists, but fewer studies have looked at how stress affects these decision-making factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today's world, taking greater risks when stressed is probably not a good strategy. But Shields speculates there may be an evolutionary explanation for the behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you're an organism that's being hunted or chased by another, then it makes sense to do stuff that you wouldn't otherwise. Perhaps making a risky decision is better than staying put."&lt;/p&gt;
