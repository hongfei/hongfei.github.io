This progressive disorder leads to gradual damage in the brain, which ultimately affects motor control and cognition, as noted by the National Health Service (NHS). In the UK alone, approximately 145,000 people are living with Parkinson's disease, according to Parkinson's UK, a charity dedicated to the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="top2brdiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that those living within a mile of golf courses have 126% higher risk of developing Parkinson's disease than those who live more than six miles away, according to a new study published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2833716" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to know more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the study say?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research has revealed a concerning link between living in close proximity to golf courses and an increased risk of developing Parkinson’s disease. Specifically, individuals residing within a mile of a golf course may see their risk of this debilitating neurodegenerative disorder more than double. Researchers from the Barrow Neurological Institute in Arizona conducted a comprehensive analysis of health records from residents near 139 golf courses located in southern Minnesota and western Wisconsin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from 711 municipal wells provided by the Minnesota Geospatial Information Office was also used to determine the correlation between proximity and prevalence of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the study, 450 incident cases from 1991 to 2015 were identified in Olmsted County, Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The odds of PD were relatively constant within close proximity to a golf course and decreased linearly as distance increased; individuals living farther from a golf course had reduced odds of PD, decreasing relative to the distance from the nearest golf course," the study explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have already linked chemicals found in pesticides including paraquat and rotenone to neurodegeneration, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Brittany Krzyzanowski, one of the authors of the study published in the journal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40338549/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, emphasized the potential role of pesticides utilized to maintain golf courses in this heightened risk. She stated, “These findings suggest that pesticides applied to golf courses may play a role in the incidence of Parkinson’s disease for nearby residents.” The researchers advocate for public health initiatives aimed at minimizing both groundwater contamination and airborne pesticide exposure from golf course maintenance to mitigate the risk of Parkinson’s disease in adjacent neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the findings?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's findings are particularly striking: individuals living within a mile of these courses have a 126% elevated chance of being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in comparison to those who live more than six miles away. The research revealed a consistent trend, indicating that the likelihood of developing the disease diminishes by 13% for every additional mile of distance from the golf course, suggesting a clear, linear relationship between proximity to golf courses and Parkinson's risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Areas that shared drinking water supplies with water used near golf courses were the most greatly impacted, the study shows. Researchers believe this shows that the pesticides used on golf courses could contribute to the number of Parkinson's cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study further revealed alarming statistics regarding drinking water sources; individuals who receive their water from areas near a golf course are nearly twice as likely to develop Parkinson's disease compared to those whose water sources are unaffected by such proximity. Certain pesticides, notably paraquat and rotenone, have been associated with the onset of Parkinson-like neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to tackle:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per the Parkinson's Foundation, cases have been higher in areas such as the Rust Belt, which includes parts of the Midwest. Cases are also high in Southern California, Southeastern Texas, Central Pennsylvania, and Florida, according to the foundation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="last8brdiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the context of pesticide regulation, it is important to note that both the UK and EU have stringent controls in place, including a ban on paraquat due to its significant health and environmental concerns. Dr. Katherine Fletcher, Research Lead at Parkinson's UK, noted that, for most individuals in the UK, the risk of pesticide exposure leading to Parkinson’s is “extremely low.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="last7brdiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="last6brdiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings of this study buttress the association between pesticide exposure and Parkinson’s disease, Dr. Fletcher cautioned that the underlying causes of the condition are complex and multifaceted, likely involving a combination of genetic predispositions and environmental influences. Numerous investigations have sought to determine the extent to which pesticide exposure may elevate the risk of Parkinson’s across various populations globally, producing mixed results overall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="last5brdiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="last4brdiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She remarked, “While this study supports the association between pesticides and Parkinson's, it is somewhat simplistic and does not fully account for other potential exposure routes, such as occupational pesticide contact, nor does it consider genetic factors that may predispose individuals to the condition.” The study opens up further dialogue about the broader implications of pesticide use and public health, particularly in the context of environmental safety and community health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="last3brdiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="last2brdiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="last1brdiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 02:29:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-gFBVV95cUxPdTlmTEhwRlY1aktGMDNwRUxtWHBwNC1fbnVKU3RrUEY0WldYdjNlTVF4OFAwY3VYTnJUNUExamhfSW15UzFDeFV5RU5ucUhDTnV5cE1XQ2dKc1N4YmZDdVZqbGxYUVcxV2pGM0pVbjMwRlYzRTF5d3AzWmxxaWZWN09TZm1kMW1hdDZlWF9qR3lPU2tqWkEzSVhOSUZGMXNXOTVadGd2bDJMb0RiMi1BS0Q1czYwTExVelMydFV2LW9rZ1NEUTF3SzZ3ZFJqdzBUUXRpNXpBSVByX0JPN0hvdkk1SnY1RWN4TTFmU0drbnlmWlMwTzJBODVn0gH_AUFVX3lxTE9XRnJWOFNfQXFBeFdldVhLZTVfSDBndHd1ZUtxckNDcVFNRzNyVU5sT1ZTaWdNcy1xdldaRnFOWVUtdWRONi1vX0NrS29GNUIwVmZZYm1lWWZTMXF0N3ZvV3NPaHRQaG0zcFJZeWFqY29oUlBsekFRaVMweTNSNEJFZW1qRlEzMGk2cFFZNW8wSnRnZ05OWHBSUXpKX2xCTDZjOXdOc0J3dllJNGFKQ3l0d0V4UUlBWUR1ZDVHRFo2d05XeGpSZC1PTUJtODJzSWFJaWJvM0RtdDUxUG1xVHU0N2ZnX00tZ21OUHBMVDhjODFGekd4Tmd0Zm9NVEN6SQ</guid></item><item><title>新研究揭示了比间歇性禁食更容易的替代方案- ScienceAlert | New Study Reveals an Easier Alternative to Intermittent Fasting - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxOakk5QUhYdkt3UWxrZGwtZ1dCRmpLelFjSWJIWGpQcG10X3VGQnJuRlFkN2xrVXZUZDE4YnhGY2RqOFBSOEllSE1GRHVBR1hhS0hrN0RlZnJJSHU1V0RsODMzc1daczkzRGw4RTl3dEJqLWlfc0lkS3VPRFYzUjBLT04wSTJ6X3hDNXVzMjJQM0VwbnFCZHRF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Intermittent fasting is not only a &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0314685"&gt;useful tool for weight loss&lt;/a&gt;, it's also shown to have &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.22065"&gt;many benefits for metabolic health&lt;/a&gt; – independent of weight loss. Yet many people may find intermittent fasting to be a challenge, especially if following the 5:2 version of the diet where calories are severely restricted two days a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-025-03646-5"&gt;my latest study&lt;/a&gt; shows that you don't need to severely restrict your calories to get the metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting. Even just restricting the number of carbs you eat twice a week may be enough to improve your metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intermittent fasting appears to be so beneficial for health because of the way it alters our metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a meal, our body enters the postprandial state. While in this state, our metabolism pushes our cells to use carbohydrates for immediate energy, while storing some of these carbs as well as fat for later use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after several hours without food, in the postabsorptive "fasted" state, our metabolism switches to using some of our fat stores for energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this regard, intermittent fasting ensures a better balance between the sources it uses for energy. This leads to &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/edrv/article/39/4/489/4982126?login=true"&gt;improved metabolic flexibility&lt;/a&gt;, which is linked with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0026049518302294?via%253Dihub"&gt;better cardiometabolic health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, this means lower risk of cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance and type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="160617" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleagues and I previously ran a study to demonstrate the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26819200/"&gt;effects of a fast&lt;/a&gt; on the body. We observed that following a day of both total fasting or severe calorie restriction (eating around only 25 percent of each person's daily calorie requirements), the body was better at clearing and burning the fat of a full English breakfast the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fasting shifted the body from using carbs to using fat. This effect carried on both during the fast and the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29508693/"&gt;Our research&lt;/a&gt; has also compared the effects of intermittent fasting to a calorie-matched or calorie-restricted diet. Both groups followed the diet until they lost 5 percent of their body weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite both groups losing the same 5 percent of body weight, and at the same rate, the intermittent fasting group had greater improvements in their metabolic handling, similar to what we saw in the previous trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.22345"&gt;Other researchers&lt;/a&gt; who have compared the effects of the 5:2 variant of the intermittent fasting diet to a calorie-matched, calorie-restricted diet have also found fasting is beneficial for metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_160624" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160624" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/IllustratedExamplesOfCarbohydrateRichFoods.jpg" alt="illustration of donut, pasta, rice, potatoes, banana and other carbohydrate rich foods" class="wp-image-160624 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/IllustratedExamplesOfCarbohydrateRichFoods.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/IllustratedExamplesOfCarbohydrateRichFoods-466x415.jpg 466w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/IllustratedExamplesOfCarbohydrateRichFoods-600x535.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-160624" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Examples of carbohydrate-rich foods. (Elena Shlyuykova/iStock/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Metabolic health benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why exactly is intermittent fasting &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34589208/"&gt;so beneficial for metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;? This is a question I sought to answer in &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-025-03646-5"&gt;my latest study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people who follow the 5:2 intermittent fasting diet, typical fasting days are, by their nature, very low in calories – equating to only a few hundred calories per day. Because people are consuming so few calories on fasting days, it also means they're consuming very few carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the postprandial state is governed by carbohydrate availability, this begged the question as to whether it's the calorie restriction or the carbohydrate restriction that's creating the metabolic effect when intermittent fasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recruited 12 overweight and obese participants. Participants were first given a very low-carb diet one day. Another day, they were given a severely calorie-restricted diet (around 75 percent fewer calories than they'd normally eat).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After each fasting day, we gave them a high-fat, high-sugar meal (similar to an English breakfast) to see how easily their bodies burned fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we found was that the shift to fat burning and improved fat handling of the high-calorie meal were near identical following both the traditional calorie-restricted "fast" day and the low-carb day. In other words, restricting carbs can elicit the same favourable metabolic effects as fasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_160626" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160626" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/ExampleOfLowCarbMealEggSalad-e1746674085190.jpg" alt="Salad with egg, tomatoes, avocado and greens" class="size-full wp-image-160626" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-160626" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In our study, restricting carbs had the same favorable metabolic effects as fasting. (d3sign/Moment/Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be important now for more studies to be conducted using a larger cohort of participants to confirm these findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such findings may help us address some of the practical problems we face with intermittent fasting and traditional low-carb diets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For intermittent fasting diets, severe calorie restriction on fasting days can increase the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-018-0370-0"&gt;risk of nutritional deficiencies&lt;/a&gt; if not careful. It can similarly be a trigger for &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34191688/"&gt;disordered eating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strict carb restriction can also be &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0273422"&gt;challenging to adhere to long-term&lt;/a&gt;, and may lead to an &lt;a href="https://eating-disorders.org.uk/carbohydrate-phobia-go-enjoy-your-toast/"&gt;unhealthy fear of carbs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other limitation of both intermittent fasting and continuous carb restriction is that weight loss is a likely outcome. Hence these approaches are not universally beneficial for those who need to improve their health without losing weight or those looking to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21677272/"&gt;maintain their weight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now testing the feasibility of an intermittent carb restriction diet, or a low-carb 5:2. So instead of restricting calories two days a week, you would restrict the number of carbs you consume twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this is proven to be beneficial, it would offer the benefits of fasting without restricting calories on "fast" days.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/254752/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;​​Is it OK to mix and match meals if there is one I do not like?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, if there’s a meal you don’t like, feel free to repeat a different recipe in this plan or browse more of our healthy &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/18314/cuisines-regions/mediterranean/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet recipes&lt;/a&gt; for additional inspiration. Because we created this meal plan with weight loss in mind, we set the calories at 1,500 calories per day and prioritized recipes high in protein and fiber that avoid added sugar. If you’re making a swap, you may want to select a recipe with a similar nutrition profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item " data-ordinal="2"&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can eat the same breakfast or lunch every day if it’s easier for your routine. Breakfast options span about 300 to 350 calories. Most lunches are about 350 calories, with the exception of the sandwich on Day 1 that’s quite a bit higher at 534 calories. If you’re opting to eat that sandwich daily while also monitoring calories or other nutrients, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item " data-ordinal="3"&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;What’s the difference between added and natural sugars?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;

Added sugar can go by several different names, including maple syrup, agave, high-fructose corn syrup, corn sugar and more. Added sugars have little nutritional value compared to other types of foods. Naturally occurring sugars are those found naturally in foods, such as fruits, vegetables and unsweetened dairy. Natural sugars don’t pose the same health risks as added sugars because these foods are also rich in nutrients like vitamins, minerals, protein and fiber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_173-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2058981/ultimate-mediterranean-diet-shopping-list/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; emphasizes a high intake of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, plant-based proteins, whole grains, fish, nuts and other healthy fats. It limits excess added sugars and ultra-processed foods, such as refined grains, sugar-sweetened beverages and packaged sweets. This healthy eating style is consistently praised for its health benefits and flexibility. While it emphasizes nutrient-rich foods, it doesn’t eliminate single food groups, which makes it easy to follow and more sustainable long-term. Following the Mediterranean diet is linked with a reduced risk of developing certain cancers, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The Mediterranean diet helps support healthy aging by reducing inflammation and prevent the onset of age-related healthy conditions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In this seven-day meal plan, we incorporate the principles of the Mediterranean diet while mapping out a reduced-calorie plan that emphasizes protein and fiber. These two nutrients can help you feel full, which may facilitate weight loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Each day provides at least 82 grams of protein and 30 grams of fiber.&lt;br&gt;

your eating to an eight-hour window each day could be a key to long-term &lt;a href="/topic/weight"&gt;weight&lt;/a&gt; loss, according to new research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study presented at the European Congress on &lt;a href="/topic/obesity"&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="/topic/malaga"&gt;Malaga&lt;/a&gt; found that overweight and obese individuals who adopted this time-restricted eating pattern successfully lost weight and maintained their reduced weight over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the research is yet to be peer-reviewed, the findings suggest that this strategy could be an effective tool for those struggling with weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Dr Alba Camacho-Cardenosa, from the University of Granada in Spain, said: “Our study found that restricting the eating window to eight hours at any time of the day for three months can result in significant &lt;a href="/topic/weight-loss"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; for at least a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These benefits can be attributed to the 16-hour fasting window rather than the time of eating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A previous randomised controlled trial by the same researchers published in the journal Nature Medicine found that restricting eating to eight hours per day decreased &lt;a href="/topic/body-weight"&gt;body weight&lt;/a&gt; and improved cardiometabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their latest study looked at

Images/iStockphoto)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals were split into four groups for 12 weeks – eating in a 12-hour or more window; restricting eating to an eight-hour window starting before 10am; restricting eating to an eight-hour window starting after 1pm; and allowing people to select their own eight-hour window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All groups were given tips on a Mediterranean diet to help them eat healthier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers measured body weight, waist and hip circumferences at the start of the trial, after the 12-week plan, and 12 months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that, while those eating over 12 hours or longer lost an average of 1.4kg, the time-restricted groups lost more, at around 3kg to 4kg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time-restricted groups also had greater reductions in waist and hip circumferences of several centimetres, and had maintained greater weight loss after 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the one-year mark, those eating for 12 hours or more had an average body weight increase of 0.4kg, compared with around a 2kg weight loss in the early and late time restricted groups, the study concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who chose their own pattern also maintained some weight loss although this was not statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 85% to 88% of people restricting their eating window also found they stuck to the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Jonatan Ruiz, study co-ordinator from the University of Granada, said: “This kind of intermittent fasting appears feasible for adults with overweight or obesity who wish to have a relatively simple way of losing and maintaining weight loss that is less tedious and more time efficient compared with daily calorie counting, but it warrants further investigations in larger and longer-term studies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Maria Chondronikola, principal investigator and lead for human nutrition at University of Cambridge Metabolic Research Laboratories, said further studies were needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding how well participants adhered to the timing of their meals, the level of their caloric intake and whether time-restricted eating changed any obesity-related metabolic outcomes would provide valuable insight into the true effectiveness of time-restricted eating,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The

We need to see more investment into finding treatments, whether that’s new medications or other forms of clinical support, which improve mental illness without troubling side-effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Weight loss injections should only be used on prescription and in conjunction with medical advice, and particular consideration must be given around people at risk of eating disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 22:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxOQ3JWTjNVbDJoQ0JsUnNpQ2RBMFZWZ1B6YnZrTzFEaV9jZi12ZmRSMG1xbEQ1T1d2VnF3Y19yZWZmOHBGZTd2XzZWVnc0SFRycy1rd3ppVmlQVHlESjNhb1R5eDRBX0NOeWpLZEFYMkwzRnVDYUplNTJVQzViZWNJQU5mOVRxbHlscHlzcV9UWllLRHZkbUVqS0ItOENNd05rV0l2RVFfbUMzbDBxenc</guid></item><item><title>麻疹疫情30年来首次突破1000例--《纽约邮报》 | Measles outbreak surpasses 1,000 cases for the first time in 30 years - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNN0RUTHNWSUJJdDZoRDNSdTVyOVRnLXZ2N2w4WkphU1lac21CUkxLMTV0ajVqdWJJV0Z6OUNxb3U4MGVCZktjTFZlMFpfMFNYdkJ2eFZKbS1uRFM3RnlSMkZFdlp1WnNmWHFnTWJoX01iSEhONXg3NzVDWFBBNjZNUWRVbDdPZTh6UjF0LVhyajIzTzZra3JmVTVEa2xsUHpYeUUwOEpPTVRCbGc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;The country’s measles outbreak has surpassed 1,000 cases for the first time in 30 years, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;/a&gt;revealed this week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The data, which is based on confirmed measles cases reported to CDC, show that the disease has now hit 1,001 people in a total of 31 states — a sharp uptick from the 285 reported cases in all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2025 alone, there have been a total of 14 outbreaks, which is categorized as 3 or more related cases — and 93% of the 1,001 cases were from these outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Three people have died from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two were unvaccinated, but healthy, school-aged children in Texas — which is where the majority of total cases have been confirmed — and one was an adult in New Mexico, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/09/nx-s1-5393762/measles-math-what-to-know-about-1-001-measles-cases-across-the-country#:~:text=3%20deaths,was%20diagnosed%20with%20measles%20posthumously." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to NPR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The extremely contagious viral illness is spread when an infected person coughs and sneezes, and is marked by symptoms of high fever, runny nose, cough, red and watery eyes and a rash, &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/measles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to Johns Hopkins Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is so contagious that about 9 out of 10 people who come near a person with measles and are not protected by vaccination will also become infected,” the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/downloads/measles-factsheet-outbreak-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;CDC warns on its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If more than 95% percent of people in a community have gotten the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, most will be protected from contracting the measles due to herd immunity. Out of the 1,001 patients with the disease, 96% were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccination numbers are down amongst US kindergarteners, decreasing from 95.2% during the 2019–2020 school year to 92.7% during 2023–2024, according to the&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_7-mmr-vaccine-coverage-for-kindergarteners-by-school-year-2009%e2%80%932024" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Children under the age of 5 account for around one-third of the 1,001 cases in the country, the latest data show. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Department of Health &amp;amp; Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/health-secretary-rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-falsely-claims-wanes-rcna200636" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told CBS News&lt;/a&gt; the disease won’t ever disappear, since the vaccine’ effectiveness diminishes over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re always going to have measles, no matter what happens, as the vaccine wanes very quickly,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia,  disagreed, telling&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/health-secretary-rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-falsely-claims-wanes-rcna200636" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; NBC&lt;/a&gt;, “We eliminated measles from this country. That could never happen if immunity waned.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The HSS &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/09/measles-hits-1000-cases-for-the-second-time-in-30-years-00337905" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told Politico&lt;/a&gt; that Kennedy is taking the jump in cases seriously.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Secretary Kennedy has responded to the current measles outbreak with urgency and clarity. He has publicly emphasized that vaccines remain the most effective way to prevent measles,” an HSS spokesperson told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug administration has approved the U.S.'s first at-home alternative to the Pap smear, a procedure generations of women have dreaded and often found painful.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new device by &lt;a href="https://www.getteal.com/news/fda-approves-teal-healths-teal-wand-tm---the-first-and-only-at-home-self-collection-device-for-cervical-cancer-screening-introducing-a-comfortable-alternative-to-in-person-screening" target="_blank"&gt;Teal Health&lt;/a&gt; will offer a "much preferred experience," the company said in its announcement, and also aims to increase screening rates by making the procedure more convenient.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Traditionally, gynecologists have inserted a cold metal speculum deep into a woman's vagina to scrape cells from the cervix. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Teal Wand — "built with empathy," the company said — uses a swab to collect a vaginal sample. Women will then mail the sample to a lab that will screen for HPV (human papillomavirus), the virus that causes nearly all cervical cancers. A growing body of research has found &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/07/03/625696664/for-women-over-30-there-may-be-a-better-choice-than-the-pap-smear" target="_blank"&gt;HPV testing&lt;/a&gt; to be highly accurate.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The FDA approval Friday follows a &lt;a href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63d5330e6841081487be0bd6/681d6148758c5c1fe0c81f2e_Teal-Health-SELF-CERV-Report-May92025-sml.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;U.S.-based study&lt;/a&gt; that found at-home screening was just as effective as that done in a doctor's office. The study also found women overwhelmingly preferred self–screening at home, and said they'd be more likely to stay up to date with cervical cancer screenings that way.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Every year, about &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/cervical-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank"&gt;13,000 cases&lt;/a&gt; of cervical cancer are diagnosed, and more than 4,000 women die from the disease. Rates are down dramatically since &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/04/30/398872421/the-great-success-and-enduring-dilemma-of-cervical-cancer-screening" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Georgios Papanicolaou&lt;/a&gt; published a 1943 paper on how to use the Pap smear for screening, and it then became common.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But about a &lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/browse-objectives/cancer/increase-proportion-females-who-get-screened-cervical-cancer-c-09" target="_blank"&gt;quarter of women&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. are behind on such screenings, and medical experts say reducing that is key to the ultimate goal of eliminating cervical cancer. There's also a &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/cervical-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank"&gt;racial gap&lt;/a&gt;, with Black and Native American women far more likely to die from cervical cancer than white women. The &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/09/12/g-s1-21283/cervical-cancer-hpv-vaccine" target="_blank"&gt;HPV vaccine&lt;/a&gt; for teen and preteen girls, introduced in 2007, has also led to a global push to tackle the disease that way.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At-home cervical cancer screenings are already available in several other countries, including &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/self-collection-for-the-cervical-screening-test" target="_blank"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/08-09-2022-hpv-self-sampling-in-sweden-leading-to-faster-elimination-of-cervical-cancer" target="_blank"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Teal Health says its self-testing device will be available starting next month, in California first and then expanding.

The diet also included supplemental vitamins believed to boost cognition. "Those interventions were coupled with 30 minutes of aerobic exercise daily and strength training three times a week... to boost social support, subjects and spouses participated in an hourlong support group three times a week led by a mental health professional."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study had favorable results, it has been viewed under scrutiny by other academics due to its conflicting results with a study from June of 2024 that found patients who switch to a healthier lifestyle could lower their risk of the disease but could not reverse its effects. That study was also very small, so many scientists agreed that a larger study needs to be done to find which result is more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, since the study implemented so many lifestyle changes it's hard to pinpoint exactly which one was the most helpful, or if they were all necessary to help the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the issues with the study, senior study author Rudolph Tanzi said that the results are "shocking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To get significant results on these cognitive tests in just 20 weeks, in just 50 patients, only altering lifestyle, to be very honest was just shocking to me, but shocking because it says maybe this matters," Tanzi said. "But I'm the first to say that it’s a small study. It was only 20 weeks, so let’s not jump to any conclusions. But boy, what a great start."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WKRC</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 16:48:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAJBVV95cUxPbUpQUHlQcWlfb1M3YWRVOTZTbUFhRFdHM0NHLUpuVnkzSlpubzFMNlRKVlFOZ0ZxY2RiU0E1N0pZT1BDRHJjOWkxNnB0V3dNWHRPTmNBbmhlNzFSQXNUWUJKSFd1ZERmQ09QcUZsbS1QSng5enUtNVJ0dFliV2NoNVlqWS1rS0VHRjJ3RHNaRHI5c3Y1bWQ5YnN5TUNKT19WTUVPMXBDc2ZOWWdCZVllVF9DVlgxZzRrazlQQzRhOHhFQlVUWUlvb1ZyWDFwUktzeEtPOXRfQmk1eHloeFpFdUk0SkFkOVUzcUc4Y0g5dkxmdFNhZkY2cU5JNmxma3Q2RzVGSV9KVUJ6VWd3TVJNMw</guid></item><item><title>蛋白质发现只需一剂即可提高寿命、肌肉和脑力- Earth.com | Protein discovered that boosts lifespan, muscle, and brain power with just one dose - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQNjBnZjNqVGNIT09iSUNvTUg5T19ZYmhQUTRPZmFiYVNNUl9DbjV5czB3UVE4eklLMGZFYUhWdVQwUmVDV0Z4N2VrODFLX3dnSnpIQVU4Yk9kVC1LQjhxSzhVcm5hdmstdmY5NmRuNVl4ZThVUndSamc2ZGZvR2RJUU9DcGRJNWJRSlVFV1UxOWlsRGlxOHNBSi1uaUtxNmc4emJoZnhrT0RfZTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people worry about the gradual loss of stamina, strength, and mental sharpness that comes with aging. Scientists have been exploring new ideas to tackle these concerns and increase not just our years but also our quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international team has been testing a special approach that raises levels of a natural protein in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their research was led by Professor Miguel Chillón at the Institute of Neurosciences of the Autonomous University of Barcelona (&lt;a href="https://web.ub.edu/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UB&lt;/a&gt;), and it shines a light on what might someday help people stay healthier for a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/organ-aging-can-predict-diseases-decades-in-advance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;longer period&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-protein-s-kl-and-its-role-in-aging"&gt;Protein s-KL and its role in aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protein at the center of this work is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41581-018-0078-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Klotho&lt;/a&gt;, and the form used in the experiments is the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26599613/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;secreted version&lt;/a&gt; known as s-KL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies suggest that Klotho may influence a wide range of biological processes by managing signals that affect inflammation and cell aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name Klotho first appeared in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/36285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;scientific journals&lt;/a&gt; in the late 1990s, when experiments showed that a deficiency of this protein made mice look older and more frail at younger ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have been working with the Klotho protein for some time, due to its therapeutic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-old-are-you-really-new-tool-measures-aging-from-the-inside-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;potential&lt;/a&gt; for treating neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we wanted to see whether s-KL could also be beneficial for healthy aging by examining a broad range of factors,” explained Professor Chillón.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-differences-between-males-and-females"&gt;Differences between males and females&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects of s-KL weren’t the same for male and female mice. Males showed clearer gains in lifespan and muscle strength, while females responded more strongly in measures of bone structure, especially when treated earlier in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These sex-based differences might be tied to how male and female bodies process viral vectors or express the s-KL protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormonal factors could also play a role, suggesting future human trials may need sex-specific &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/curiosity-might-help-you-stay-sharp-as-you-age/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;strategies&lt;/a&gt; to get the best results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aging-improvements-with-s-kl-protein"&gt;Aging improvements with s-KL protein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers noticed that mice given s-KL retained better muscle tissue composition, with less of the scarring often linked to older age. They also had stronger performance in tasks that tested endurance and coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weakened bones can be a big danger in older adults, so it was intriguing that s-KL seemed to keep the inner bone structure more intact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding aligns with earlier &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16436465/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;observations&lt;/a&gt; that Klotho influences mineral balance in bone and may reduce the chances of fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-timing-may-matter"&gt;Why timing may matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice treated at 12 months old showed more pronounced improvements in longevity and physical health than those treated at 6 months. One reason could be that the aging mice produced higher levels of the s-KL protein after treatment, which may have amplified its &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-bodies-begin-breaking-down-two-very-precise-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;effects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding raises an important question: Could middle age be a better window for intervention than early adulthood? If so, the timing of s-KL therapy in humans could be just as critical as the treatment itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-signs-of-brain-support"&gt;Signs of brain support&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from the physical improvements, the investigators measured changes in the hippocampus, a region crucial for memory and cognitive ability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They detected heightened markers of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4563705/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;adult neurogenesis&lt;/a&gt;, which is the process by which new neurons form in mature brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also evidence that key immune cells in the brain might be working in a more balanced way. This could help remove cellular waste and reduce the chronic inflammation tied to age-related brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used gene therapy vectors that prompted cells to produce s-KL over an extended period. These vectors included genetic instructions, and once inside the mice, the cells took over production of the protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach was designed to boost s-KL levels in both the brain and other areas of the body. This helped ensure that many of the organs linked to muscle, bone, and memory got the extra support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-s-kl-protein-and-human-aging"&gt;s-KL protein and human aging?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this study was done in mice, the results open the door to potential &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/defying-time-three-ways-to-slow-biological-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;therapies&lt;/a&gt; for humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age-related decline in mobility, memory, and bone strength all contribute to lower independence and quality of life in older adults. A treatment that addresses these together could shift how we think about aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many current drugs only target one issue at a time, like &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/outdoor-exercise-amplifies-physical-and-mental-health-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/your-sleep-may-predict-memory-loss-years-in-advance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;memory loss&lt;/a&gt;. But the effects of s-KL span across systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This points toward the possibility of a more unified strategy to aging – one that works with the body’s existing repair mechanisms rather than replacing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-s-kl-protein-research"&gt;What’s next for s-KL protein research?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we can find a viable delivery method, s-KL could make a significant contribution to improving people’s quality of life and helping to build the healthiest society possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists continue to explore whether direct protein administration or refined gene-based aging options might work best for humans. They plan to keep studying how s-KL weaves into different biological pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/fulltext/S1525-0016(25)00120-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Molecular Therapy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 16:39:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQNjBnZjNqVGNIT09iSUNvTUg5T19ZYmhQUTRPZmFiYVNNUl9DbjV5czB3UVE4eklLMGZFYUhWdVQwUmVDV0Z4N2VrODFLX3dnSnpIQVU4Yk9kVC1LQjhxSzhVcm5hdmstdmY5NmRuNVl4ZThVUndSamc2ZGZvR2RJUU9DcGRJNWJRSlVFV1UxOWlsRGlxOHNBSi1uaUtxNmc4emJoZnhrT0RfZTQ</guid></item><item><title>如果你想好好衰老，专家说你应该立即开始做这些非常简单的事情- buzzfeed.com | If You Want To Age Well, Experts Say You Should Start Doing These Very Simple Things Immediately - buzzfeed.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNSG1oUVhrbEZFeURLMEZSVXNGSldZTWVLbzRlRElnYnNFQWdTdFJzZ2wtaGdjZ0VHUzV1a2tOeVNnUkdkQVgxa2h6TnRDWFh4S09WRFduZll0R0g1M0h2c19yR3Baam5tWEVTeTV3cU5XUU1KZWJNWEZuMmctbEFDczB0ZDNpUXJENTNn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;“So often, people don’t age well because they’re not upfront about what their needs are,” said &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robyn-golden-2466315/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7874738" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Robyn Golden&lt;/a&gt;, the associate vice president of social work and community health at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. “How do we make it OK for people to say, ‘This is what I need, I’m feeling lonely, I need someone to go out with on a Tuesday night.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rampant ageism makes it easy for people to feel like a burden or invisible, Golden said, which can encourage silent suffering. But it’s important to push against that and let folks know when you’re having a tough time. So if you’re someone who can share your thoughts and needs with your family and friends, that’s a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, if you’re struggling with depression and anxiety, it’s important to let your doctor know. There’s often a false belief that anxiety or depression after a certain age is more “normal,” but Golden said this is not true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Depression can be treated at any age, and not just with medication, with counseling, with group interventions, you name it. So, I think that’s part of how you age well, being open to being able to say, ‘This is who I am, this is what I need,’” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;

These chemicals are &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/chemicals/formaldehyde.html"&gt;known carcinogens&lt;/a&gt;, which means they &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/life-style/health-and-families/acne-best-treatment-cancer-benzene-clearasil-b2510485.html"&gt;can cause cancer or help it grow.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was based on surveys filled out by 70 Black and Latina women in Los Angeles. Each time one of the women used a personal care product, they took a picture of the ingredient label and sent it to researchers via an app. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-three percent of the women used at least one personal care product that listed formaldehyde releasers on its label, the study found. These women also reported using many of these products daily or multiple times per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The carcinogen was found in 58 percent of the haircare products reported, the study revealed.

Previous studies had already revealed the carcinogen is in products to help straighten hair or smooth curls, and it &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39020161/"&gt;poses a disproportionate risk to Black women&lt;/a&gt; and other women of color. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week’s study is the first to demonstrate that the carcinogen is in a wide variety of products beyond hair straighteners, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that this isn’t just about hair straighteners,” lead author Dr. Robin Dodson said in a &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.silentspring.org/news/formaldehyde-releasers-found-common-personal-care-products"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. “These chemicals are in products we use all the time, all over our bodies.

We shouldn’t have to be chemists to figure out what kinds of products will make us sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/topic/european-union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; and ten U.S. states have banned or proposed a ban on formaldehyde. The &lt;a href="/topic/food-and-drug-administration"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; even proposed a national ban on formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasing chemicals in 2023, but it has yet to be enacted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dodson said the best solution would be ending the use of these chemicals in personal products altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ideally, companies shouldn’t be putting these chemicals in products in the first place,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 16:27:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxQMnozN1pZbC1OSVVRVlhBR0JyQzhOam51M0VCQ0lvSU5nU29WZmdJcF92LUpQRW1ZeFZnU1RtamRLTzV1SmJtRUxYTUZIZVlKZ2xPUTJSZTgyaFh2OHFLOHN6eHM1dVRldDltU1h2QnlFVnozaDRYZXVrUUtMNmxDUVdPQ2pKUEstdEpKcml1RE5JZmx1Slk0bzV2b0dMMC13Nktv</guid></item><item><title>“暗光子”光理论旨在推翻著名的双缝实验，颠覆量子物理学- Earth.com | 'Dark photon' theory of light aims to take down the famous double-slit experiment, upending quantum physics - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPb0hNX2RyN3h6U0tKdDRlQ0RYRC0xa2dNb2lYeEdiOU1SMGhWNXlsOFFmY1daRHlrazU4aXBXZmNER01Zdnd5VUdFR1NweXgxNnkwSEJ4TS1OVVFqbFBqd3Vqc1Nuby1hQ29IMlR0Z3J4YnF2QmJrWU1BSmpXdjYxR183ZFBWakNJTjdwRU5tZEU5cVg1NjJDOFJhbEJJNE54MHMwWVVjUkUycTVyMS1QZ0xmNXBEb2VxcDJn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For centuries, most scientists have shared the belief that light behaves as both a wave and a particle. This idea, then, became the central component to quantum theory, sprouting the field of science known as quantum mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The double-slit experiment supported the idea, showing bright and dark bands that indicated wave-like interference. But now, a new study suggests that this experiment might not lock us into seeing light as a wave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the experts, we can interpret those interference bands using quantum particles alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was led by Gerhard Rempe, the director of the &lt;a href="https://www.mpq.mpg.de/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Max Planck Institute&lt;/a&gt; for Quantum Optics. He teamed up with collaborators at &lt;a href="https://www.srinter.ufscar.br/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Federal University of São Carlos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ethz.ch/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ETH Zurich&lt;/a&gt; for the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-modern-physics-and-our-view-of-light"&gt;Modern physics and our view of light&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1801, &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstl.1802.0004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Thomas Young&lt;/a&gt; introduced an experiment by shining light through two narrow openings to produce intersecting fringes on a screen. His findings led many to conclude that light must be a wave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A century later, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/quantum-gates-teleported-a-leap-toward-scalable-computing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;quantum&lt;/a&gt; mechanics began to take shape, revealing that quantum particles like electrons could mimic wave-like light interference too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albert Einstein’s work on the &lt;a href="https://www.scirp.org/reference/referencespapers?referenceid=1617833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;photoelectric effect&lt;/a&gt; showed that light travels in discrete packets called photons. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/121580a0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Niels Bohr&lt;/a&gt; then elaborated on wave-particle duality, ushering in one of the cornerstones of modern physics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dark-and-visible-photons"&gt;Dark and visible photons&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.133603" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;approach&lt;/a&gt; from the research team explores the concept of bright and dark modes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their view, interference patterns can emerge from combining “detectable” and “undetectable” photon states. These bright states interact with an observer, while dark &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/google-claims-commercial-quantum-computing-is-just-five-years-away/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; remain hidden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such hidden photons might linger at places where we would normally think the light cancels out. Observers who try to track the path of these photons alter the state, flipping what was dark into bright or vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this perspective, the light pathways can be viewed as quantum superpositions, rather than purely classical wave interference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-quantum-particles-and-light-interference"&gt;Quantum particles and light interference &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my humble opinion, our description is meaningful as it provides a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/baffling-quantum-entanglement-statistics-puzzle-finally-solved-advanced-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;quantum&lt;/a&gt; picture (with particles) of classical interference (with waves): maxima and minima result from entangled bright (that couple) and dark (that do not couple) particle states,” said Rempe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Physicists once believed that any point of total destructive interference prevented light from interacting with matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new framework, even a place with zero average electric field can host particles that standard measurement devices might miss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group emphasizes that these findings do not throw out past results but reveal a new layer of detail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rempe said their model helps clarify parts of a long-standing debate – like which-path detection – that once involved major figures in science, including Newton, Maxwell, Einstein, Millikan, and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wave-only-theories-vs-dark-photons"&gt;Wave-only theories vs. dark photons&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/bridging-quantum-classical-physics-nanoparticle-entanglement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Classical physics&lt;/a&gt; can explain most everyday optical events. Yet certain experiments in quantum optics highlight outcomes that purely wave-based theories cannot handle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have long known that Maxwell’s equations begin to fail in scenarios where single photons interact with atoms on tiny scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new framework places particles at the heart of interference. The wave-like fringes may just be statistical maps of how bright or dark these &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-form-of-quantum-entanglement-discovered-will-transform-next-gen-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;quantum states&lt;/a&gt; are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measuring certain properties that push photons into detectable or undetectable modes can influence outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-measurement-changes-things"&gt;How measurement changes things&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any attempt to pinpoint a photon’s route through two slits runs into the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/impossibility-paradox-calculating-incalculable-quantum-realm-particles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;famous uncertainty principle&lt;/a&gt;. A quick look might destroy the fringe pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these studies, measuring the photon is less about giving it a momentum kick and more about switching the dark state to a bright one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decades of work in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-quantum-states-found-in-crystal-layers-could-boost-computing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;quantum information&lt;/a&gt; science hinted that delicate systems can be “observed” without collapsing them entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new interpretation builds on that notion. If the observer couples to a photon hidden in a dark region, the state might become bright enough to be registered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-particle-based-light-interference"&gt;Particle-based light interference &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wave-particle duality is central in physics curricula around the world, teaching that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/super-photons-fascinating-behavior-in-quantum-realm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;light and matter&lt;/a&gt; can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than uprooting that duality, this theory nudges us to see interference in a purely particle-based explanation. It keeps the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/schrodingers-cat-put-into-silicon-chip-may-be-holy-grail-for-error-proof-quantum-computing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;quantum superposition&lt;/a&gt; principle at the core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a philosophical level, some scientists suggest that we might shift our mental picture toward probabilities of bright and dark particles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, most institutions will continue to teach the wave framework as a useful approximation that works in many practical settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-are-dark-photons-important"&gt;Why are dark photons important?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The updated model might spark creative ways of detecting light in places once thought to be “voids.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novel detectors could be devised to probe areas of destructive interference with &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389928886_Atomic_and_Ionic_Systems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;advanced atomic or ionic systems&lt;/a&gt;. These methods might eventually shape futuristic optical technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experimental physicists may also look for subtle traces of photons lurking in dark states. If those photons can be coaxed into bright states without disturbing other properties, entirely new measurement techniques might arise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That prospect has captured attention because it challenges everyday views of how light interacts with sensors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-searching-for-light-s-true-nature"&gt;Searching for light’s true nature&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research prompts the question of what other fundamental assumptions may give way under quantum scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers are already attempting to extend these quantum ideas about light to larger-scale experiments, including matter waves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even aspects of gravitational wave detection might gain fresh insights from the concept of dark states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics point out that wave-based models still work splendidly at larger distances. This new quantum picture of light appears indispensable only when single particles and atoms come into play. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it replaces or merely complements classical interpretations remains the next big debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.133603" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physical Review Letters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 16:24:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPb0hNX2RyN3h6U0tKdDRlQ0RYRC0xa2dNb2lYeEdiOU1SMGhWNXlsOFFmY1daRHlrazU4aXBXZmNER01Zdnd5VUdFR1NweXgxNnkwSEJ4TS1OVVFqbFBqd3Vqc1Nuby1hQ29IMlR0Z3J4YnF2QmJrWU1BSmpXdjYxR183ZFBWakNJTjdwRU5tZEU5cVg1NjJDOFJhbEJJNE54MHMwWVVjUkUycTVyMS1QZ0xmNXBEb2VxcDJn</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，美国各州的预期寿命存在显著差异-新闻的光明面 | Study finds striking differences in life expectancy across U.S. states - The Brighter Side of News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxOUTRVMW9VNWtOUkptLTduNXVKd0Nhc3JheHBULTVOcXByVDZlOHVYNXZTRG5FVzRxb0dqTm5pUDhyNzdQaWYwczB0SzdmUlBEaWVYQjlHT1VXOUZydEZHaGtKN0g3azJoRlJmZnN6Ymx2a2daWTVaQWVtMkVPalZTS0dwYmVZMGpCOFlybjhLTVBYN1pRNlppOTlBcGtnU1o3aF9XVnpaYUhjSU1p?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiBox-root css-a9h2n1" data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks"&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life expectancy in the United States varies dramatically based on where someone lives. A groundbreaking study by researchers at the &lt;a href="https://ysph.yale.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Yale School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt; (YSPH) examined more than 179 million deaths from 1969 to 2020, revealing wide gaps in longevity among states and highlighting how local health policies shape lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, Americans enjoyed steady gains in lifespan due to improved sanitation, tobacco control, medical care, and prevention of chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer. But these gains haven't been equal across the country. Some states have thrived, while others lagged behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="geography_shapes_your_lifespan"&gt;Geography Shapes Your Lifespan&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2833159" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;, used an innovative approach by tracking groups of people born around the same time—called birth cohorts—instead of looking at each year separately.

Holford, the study's lead author and a professor at YSPH. "It shows the long-term impact of policies and social conditions affecting the life course."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1900 to 2000, life expectancy improved significantly in the Northeast and West, especially in New York, California, and Washington, D.C. For instance, women in New York and California saw &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/scientists-discover-a-surprising-link-between-high-carb-diets-and-life-expectancy/"&gt;lifespan gains&lt;/a&gt; of over 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast, Southern states like Mississippi, Alabama, and Kentucky saw minimal increases, particularly among women—less than three years over the same century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's a staggering contrast," Holford noted. "Where you are born shouldn’t determine how long you live.

Progressive states often adopted measures early, such as tobacco control laws or broader access to healthcare, helping people live longer, healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;California, for example, banned smoking in workplaces early in 1995. As a result, entire generations grew up without &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/helping-low-income-smokers-quit-the-power-of-a-small-incentive/"&gt;second-hand smoke&lt;/a&gt; exposure, and many adults quit smoking.

Similar trends appeared in West Virginia, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, states that historically lacked aggressive health measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Life Expectancy Study results for men.

"These trends in mortality and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/life-expectancy-gains-are-slowing-despite-advances-in-healthcare/"&gt;life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; reflect not only each state’s policy environment but also their underlying demographics," Tam said. "It’s not surprising states with fewer improvements to life expectancy also have higher poverty rates."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="generational_health_differences"&gt;Generational Health Differences&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's novel cohort approach also revealed how early life experiences shape health outcomes as people age. Early exposure to sanitation, &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/antibiotics-vaccinations-and-anti-inflammatory-drugs-found-to-lower-risk-of-dementia/"&gt;vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;, or tobacco control profoundly affects health later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers measured how quickly death rates rise after age 35. Longer intervals between these increases indicate healthier aging. Again, regional differences were striking. New York and Florida showed healthier aging patterns, while Oklahoma and Iowa saw quicker mortality escalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Period Life Expectancy at Birth for US Females by State and Calendar Year (1969, 1995, and 2020).

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="23" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmah8fujc001h3b76mculryd7@published"&gt;My husband recently played a horrible prank on me. Several nights ago, we were in bed when he asked me to feel his testicles.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmah8x6fa002l3b76wb0jqvqx@published"&gt;He said he thought he felt a lump. A jolt of fear shot through me, and my heart immediately started racing, but I didn’t find anything. He kept encouraging me to continue. After 10 minutes, I told him I still wasn’t finding anything, and he replied, “Honey? Thanks a lot! That felt great!” and burst out laughing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="58" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmah8ful5001i3b76y3f8jkgl@published"&gt;I was furious. The entire time, images of our two kids growing up without their dad were flashing through my mind because I thought he might have cancer! I spent the night in the guest room. The next morning, I told him he wasn’t getting laid for a month. My husband thinks I’m overreacting. Considering what he did, I think I’m being lenient. Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

He scared you &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; made you feel on his balls for 10 minutes. That’s a lot of time to be down there, no matter how big they are. Spending the night in the guest room was a good way to underline your upset. Maybe an ensuing chilliness for a few days would work as well. No sex for a month does seem like a lot, but look, if you really don’t care and you think this is the best way to convey the message of, “Never do that again,” well, your body, your choice. But you might use the month to reflect: Why is it so easy for you to give up sex for a month?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmah8fuu2001m3b76hgen20oe@published"&gt;What I don’t like about using sex as a bargaining chip is that it assumes that your husband derives way more pleasure from it. Otherwise, depriving him would also mean depriving you, and why punish yourself? If that is, in fact, the state of things, well, I would pursue a more equitable arrangement. What are you not getting that you want? What could be done differently? Discussing this stuff could be useful, especially if you’re just taking for granted that your sex life is way more important to him than it is to you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmah8d369000hehkxc561hof2@published"&gt;I’m a 30-year-old gay guy. After years of lots of really hot flings but no long-term relationships, I think my current boyfriend could be the one. He’s much more wholesome and innocent than the guys I’ve been with in the past, which I actually really like. Plus, the sex is great! We’ve been together for six months, and he recently took me on a trip to his home state to meet his family (parents and two siblings, plus some extended family). &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/06/boyfriends-brother-hookup-advice.html"&gt;Everything was going great until his brother showed up.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that problematic users were more inclined to click, like, comment on, and share false news stories, regardless of their accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study highlights a behavioral connection between social media overuse and susceptibility to misinformation, raising concerns about the role of digital habits in shaping public opinion. These findings could guide mental health professionals, policymakers, and social platforms in efforts to curb the spread of false information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problematic Use = Misinformation Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Excessive social media users are more likely to believe and share fake news.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Addiction Pattern:&lt;/strong&gt; Problematic social media use shows similarities to addictive behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Health Concern:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may help clinicians and platforms target misinformation-prone users.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Michigan State University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A first-of-its-kind study from researchers at Michigan State University reveals that individuals who experience the most distress and impairment in daily functioning from social media use are more likely to believe fake news.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Social media are everywhere in our daily lives, and some people display problematic, excessive use of these platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109760"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-media-disinformation-spread-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-media-disinformation-spread-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-media-disinformation-spread-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-media-disinformation-spread-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-media-disinformation-spread-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-media-disinformation-spread-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-media-disinformation-spread-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-media-disinformation-spread-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a man on a phone." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-media-disinformation-spread-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-media-disinformation-spread-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-media-disinformation-spread-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-media-disinformation-spread-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-media-disinformation-spread-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-media-disinformation-spread-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/social-media-disinformation-spread-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Fake or false news falls under two categories: misinformation if it is unintentionally distributed and disinformation if it is intentionally distributed to deceive people. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that this overuse is associated with a greater tendency to believe in and engage with misinformation,” said Dar Meshi, an associate professor and co-author of the study, which published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt; and was funded by MSU’s Trifecta Initiative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshi and his co-author, Maria D. Molina, both faculty members in the MSU College of Communication Arts and Sciences, conducted an online experiment in which 189 participants, age 18 to 26, were presented with 20 news stories formatted as social media posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten of the stories were real and ten were false, and the order of delivery was randomized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By assessing participants’ credibility judgment of these news posts; participants intentions to click, comment, like and share posts; and their degree of problematic social media use, Meshi and Molina found that the greater people’s symptoms of problematic social media use, the more likely they were to: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;believe fake news is true; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;interact with news posts regardless if they were real or fake; and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;want to click on fake news posts. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fake or false news falls under two categories: misinformation if it is unintentionally distributed and disinformation if it is intentionally distributed to deceive people.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“False news has become a hotly debated and researched topic because of its availability to be shared and spread over social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over 60% of people in the U.S. read content on social media, and research has demonstrated that false news disseminates over social media at a greater rate than real news,” said Molina.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe their study is the first to look at how problematic social media use is involved with people’s trust in fake news by measuring their intended actions, like clicking, liking and sharing posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the American Psychiatric Association doesn’t recognize problematic social media use as a clinical disorder, Meshi points out that it shares similarities with substance use and other behavioral addictive disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who display problematic social media use may feel bad if they can’t access it, and they might even return to it after trying to quit. This kind of behavior has been linked to job loss, poor grades and mental health issues,” Meshi said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshi and Molina hope their findings will help mental health professionals working with people who struggle with social media use, as well as others in the health care field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Individuals with signs of problematic social media use may also be more susceptible to health-related misinformation, so clinicians specializing in different fields may benefit from awareness of their patients’ degree of social media use,” said Molina. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings could also help inform efforts from governmental agencies, organizations and social media companies to combat misinformation and disinformation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By identifying people who are more likely to believe fake news, we can help reduce its spread,” Meshi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Researchers could work with social media companies to find ways to help these users and limit their exposure to fake news.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this misinformation and psychology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b2c6d7d9dbc2d3ded7f2dfc1c79cd7d6c7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alex Tekip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://msu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Michigan State University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Alex Tekip – Michigan State University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321361" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Problematic social media use is associated with believing in and engaging with fake news&lt;/a&gt;” by Dar Meshi et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problematic social media use is associated with believing in and engaging with fake news&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media use is ubiquitous in our modern society, and some individuals display excessive, maladaptive use of these online platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This problematic social media use (PSMU) has been associated with greater impulsivity and risk-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, studies in healthy individuals have demonstrated that greater cognitive impulsivity is associated with a greater susceptibility to online “fake news.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we hypothesized that PSMU would be associated with believing in and engaging with fake news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this, we conducted an online, within-subject experiment in which participants (N=189; female=102, male=86, prefer not to disclose=1; mean age=19.8 years) completed a fake news task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This task presented participants with 20 news stories (10 real and 10 false, in random order) formatted as social media posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We assessed participants’ credibility judgments of these news posts, as well as participants’ intentions to click, like, comment, and share these posts. We also assessed participants’ degree of PSMU and then related this measure to their performance in our task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a mixed model approach, and it revealed that the greater one’s PSMU, the more one finds specifically false news credible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also found that the greater one’s PSMU, the greater one’s engagement with news posts, agnostic to the type of content (real or false).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we found that the greater one’s PSMU, the greater one’s intent to click on specifically false news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research demonstrates that individuals who experience the most distress and impairment in daily functioning from social media use are also the most susceptible to false information posted on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discuss the clinical implications of our findings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 15:37:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE9VV1hKTHhiMWs3QTRUdkRsQXdSVktUQ3FscWVMaFNMYjVaeFhQUVpwbHQwams5dTgyTnRZWWY1NFg0UzFDSlBTUnFEWWR1djNvZy1Na3QycTZKbkZlMEFoMVdQbHd5SFE2VmtYY0VsNm52UkFzWEwyN0Zn</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现隐藏在普通视线中的阿尔茨海默氏症的隐藏原因- SciTechDaily | Scientists Discover Hidden Cause of Alzheimer’s Hiding in Plain Sight - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxNZFJ1Y0pEYUxnLS15MTJBVXJfVFppMDBtM0RBaHMtcjVXU0tVSm9vamVveXR2SkFsVGl3RDRud3hLV01SWlhQaXdmc1czbWpCS1VCanZvWkRWUE1wQUVubmF2Q3M1czYyelBOeGxKTy1XQ1ZKOUFFNmhTT3Z4VlV2OER2Y3BHcmZTelJnNWZJU2lEZFpjR3JXbm93?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 15:12:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxNZFJ1Y0pEYUxnLS15MTJBVXJfVFppMDBtM0RBaHMtcjVXU0tVSm9vamVveXR2SkFsVGl3RDRud3hLV01SWlhQaXdmc1czbWpCS1VCanZvWkRWUE1wQUVubmF2Q3M1czYyelBOeGxKTy1XQ1ZKOUFFNmhTT3Z4VlV2OER2Y3BHcmZTelJnNWZJU2lEZFpjR3JXbm93</guid></item><item><title>香槟真的能降低心脏骤停的风险吗？这就是《科学》。- ScienceAlert | Does Champagne Really Lower Risk of Sudden Cardiac Arrest?

			&lt;p&gt;"My only regret in life is that I didn't drink enough champagne," the English economist and philosopher John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946) is reported to have said. As it turns out, there may be a surprising ounce of truth to that quote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture this: a glass of champagne – bubbly, crisp and, for many, reserved for toasts and celebrations. Now imagine it being mentioned in the same sentence as a way to help prevent &lt;a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/conditions/cardiac-arrest"&gt;sudden cardiac arrest&lt;/a&gt;: a condition where the heart abruptly stops beating, killing tens of thousands each year, often without warning. Sounds too good to be true, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, &lt;a href="https://onlinecjc.ca/article/S0828-282X(25)00171-0/fulltext"&gt;a Canadian study&lt;/a&gt; has uncovered a curious link. Using data from over half a million people in the health research database the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt;, researchers found that those who consumed moderate amounts of white wine or champagne had a lower risk of experiencing sudden cardiac arrest. Surprising, especially given the widely held belief &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/46/2/173/7920813?login=false#google_vignette"&gt;that red wine&lt;/a&gt;, not white, is what benefits the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9JvI392Iep8?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To rule out coincidence, the researchers double-checked their findings using genetic data – and the connection seemed to hold firm. This suggests there might be more to the story than chance alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study didn't stop at wine. It explored more than 100 lifestyle and environmental factors tied to sudden cardiac arrest, including diet, exercise, air pollution, emotional wellbeing, body composition and education levels – all of which have been independently associated with risk. The conclusion? Up to 63% of sudden cardiac arrest cases could potentially be prevented by addressing these risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among all the protective factors identified, a few stood out: fruit consumption, regular computer use (yes, really) and moderate drinking of white wine or champagne were all linked to a reduced risk of sudden cardiac arrest. Why? That remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One theory is that white wine contains antioxidants that may support heart health. Another possibility is that people who drink these types of beverages may also be more affluent and more likely to engage in other healthy behaviour, such as eating well, exercising regularly – and have access to better healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before you pop a cork in celebration, a word of caution: alcohol remains a complex and often contradictory player in heart health. Other large-scale studies suggest a &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/356/bmj.j909"&gt;U-shaped relationship&lt;/a&gt; between alcohol and cardiovascular disease. Non-drinkers may have a certain level of risk, moderate drinkers of one glass of wine a day &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7020057/"&gt;may see&lt;/a&gt; some benefit, but heavy drinking sharply increases the risk of high blood pressure, stroke and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrthm.2021.10.022"&gt;One observational study&lt;/a&gt; involving over 400,000 participants even found that moderate drinking could raise the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/arrhythmia/"&gt;arrhythmias&lt;/a&gt;, which in some cases can lead to sudden death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while champagne may offer a hopeful glimmer, it's no magic bullet. The study's broader message was clear: it's the overall lifestyle that matters most. Better sleep, regular physical activity and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-heart-patients-have-trouble-sticking-to-a-healthy-diet-and-3-things-that-help-them-eat-better-239172"&gt;a balanced diet&lt;/a&gt; significantly reduced the risk of sudden cardiac arrest – and could prevent nearly one in five cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jdgYN1QgKng?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, obesity, high blood pressure and chronic stress were among the strongest risk factors, along with lower education levels and exposure to air pollution. These findings underscore that preventing sudden cardiac arrest isn't just about personal habits: it's also about the environments we live in and the policies that shape them. Cleaner air, better education and easier access to nutritious food could all play a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sudden cardiac arrest is not entirely random. Many of the contributing factors are within our control. Managing stress, staying active, maintaining a healthy weight, getting quality sleep – and yes, perhaps enjoying the occasional glass of white wine – can all help. But the real power lies in stacking small, healthy choices over time. Prevention is rarely about a single change; it's about the cumulative effect of many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in case you were wondering: Keynes suffered a series of heart attacks in 1946, beginning during negotiations for the &lt;a href="https://history.blog.gov.uk/2020/12/07/whats-the-context-signing-the-anglo-american-financial-agreement-6-december-1945/"&gt;Anglo-American loan&lt;/a&gt; in Savannah, Georgia. He described the process as "absolute hell". A few weeks after returning to his farmhouse in Firle, East Sussex, he died of a heart attack at the age of 62.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe he was right about drinking more champagne after all.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/255708/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

By tagging neurons with light-sensitive markers and recording their unique electrical signatures, researchers created a training library that allowed the AI to distinguish neuron types in both mice and monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This breakthrough addresses a century-old challenge in neuroscience and opens the door to better understanding how different neurons contribute to behavior and disease. The tool could one day improve neural implants, help decode disorders like epilepsy, and refine how we study the brain in both animals and humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Breakthrough:&lt;/strong&gt; A new algorithm distinguishes neuron types from electrical activity with high precision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-Species Utility:&lt;/strong&gt; Validated in both mice and monkeys, with potential for human application.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Access:&lt;/strong&gt; The database and AI tool are freely available to the global research community.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brains are made up of many different types of neurons (nerve cells in the brain), each of which are thought to play different roles in processing information. Scientists have long been able to use electrodes to record the activity of neurons by detecting the electrical ‘spikes’ that they generate while performing brain functions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although recording spikes has proved invaluable for monitoring the activity of individual neurons deep in the brain, until now the method has been ‘blind’ to the type of neuron being recorded – making it impossible to identify how different neurons contribute to the brain’s overall operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, published in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, the research team have overcome this problem by identifying the distinct ‘electrical signatures’ of different neuron types in the mouse brain, using brief pulses of blue light to trigger spikes in specific cell types (a method called optogenetics).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They created a library of the different electrical signatures for each type of neuron, which then allowed them to train an AI algorithm that can automatically recognise five different types of neurons with 95% accuracy without further need for genetic tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The algorithm was also validated on brain recording data from monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers say they have overcome a major hurdle in being able to use the technology to study neurological conditions such as epilepsy, but that there is still “a long way” to go before it can be used in practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Maxime Beau, co-first author of the study from the UCL Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, said: “For decades, neuroscientists have struggled with the fundamental problem of reliably identifying the many different types of neurons that are simultaneously active during behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our approach now enables us to identify neuron types with over 95% accuracy in mice and in monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This advance will enable researchers to record brain circuits as they perform complex behaviours such as movement. Like logic gates on a computer chip, neurons in the brain are elementary computing units that come in several types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our method provides a tool to identify many of the brain’s logic gates in action at the same time. Before, it could only be done one at a time, and at much greater cost.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors say the fact that the algorithm can be applied across different species gives it huge potential for being expanded to other animals and, eventually, to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the short term, the new technique means that, instead of requiring complex genetic engineering to study the brain, researchers could use any normal animal to study what different neurons do and how they interact with one another to generate behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the ultimate aims is to be able to study neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders such as epilepsy, autism and dementia, many of which are thought to involve changes to the way different cell types in the brain interact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Beverley Clark a senior author of the study from UCL Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, said: “Just as many different instruments in an orchestra contribute to the sound of a symphony, the brain relies on many distinct neuron types to create the complex behaviour that humans and other animals exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work is analogous to learning the sound that each instrument makes and then teaching an algorithm to recognise the contribution of each of them to a symphony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being able to observe this ‘neural symphony’ of the brain in action has been a fundamental challenge in neuroscience for over 100 years, and we now have a method for reliably doing this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although the technology is a long way from being able to be used to study neurological conditions such as epilepsy, we’ve now overcome a major hurdle to reaching that goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, some recordings of living human brain activity have already been recorded in patients during surgery, and our technique could be used to study those recordings to better understand how our brains work, first in health and then in disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improved understanding of how our brains work could pave the way for some ground-breaking advances in medical science, some of which are already on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human brain-to-computer interfaces, or neural implants, are one such possibility. Ongoing research at the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences, for example, has enabled a paralysed man to control a robotic arm using a neural implant for a record seven months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the current study, this work was also informed by studying the electrical patterns in the brains of animals and using AI to automatically recognise these patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors say the new technique to differentiate neuron types could help to improve neural implants by more accurately recording which types of cells are involved in particular actions, so that the implant can more easily recognise specific signals and generate the appropriate response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key to this technology is understanding how our brains work when they’re healthy, so that any damage can be compensated for. If a person had a stroke and part of their brain was damaged, for example, you would need to understand how that bit worked before you could consider designing an implant to replicate that functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Michael Häusser, a senior author of the study from UCL Division of Medicine and The University of Hong Kong, said: “This project came to life thanks to the convergence of three critical innovations: using molecular biology to successfully ‘tag’ different neuron types using light, developments in silicon probe recording technology, and of course the fast-paced improvements in deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Crucially, the synergy in our team was absolutely instrumental. The partner labs at UCL, Baylor, Duke and Bar Ilan University have all contributed critical pieces to the puzzle. Just like the brain, the whole is larger than the sum of its parts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The database gathered by the team is freely available and the algorithm is open source, meaning scientists from across the world can use these resources for neurological research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This research was funded by funding from Wellcome, National Institutes of Health (NIH), European Research Council (ERC), and the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this AI and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Matt Midgley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Matt Midgley – UCL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.01.041" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A deep learning strategy to identify cell types across species from high-density extracellular recordings&lt;/a&gt;” by Beverley Clark et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A deep learning strategy to identify cell types across species from high-density extracellular recordings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-density probes allow electrophysiological recordings from many neurons simultaneously across entire brain circuits but fail to reveal cell type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we develop a strategy to identify cell types from extracellular recordings in awake animals and reveal the computational roles of neurons with distinct functional, molecular, and anatomical properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We combine optogenetics and pharmacology using the cerebellum as a testbed to generate a curated ground-truth library of electrophysiological properties for Purkinje cells, molecular layer interneurons, Golgi cells, and mossy fibers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We train a semi-supervised deep learning classifier that predicts cell types with greater than 95% accuracy based on the waveform, discharge statistics, and layer of the recorded neuron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The classifier’s predictions agree with expert classification on recordings using different probes, in different laboratories, from functionally distinct cerebellar regions, and across species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our classifier extends the power of modern dynamical systems analyses by revealing the unique contributions of simultaneously recorded cell types during behavior.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 14:59:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTFBvM201Rm1iS0hQZk16cmtLNWNoMWtVSUtDRF9RQThwOTF6LUFMeVJzRF9YTmc2RkZ4QUU2RFZncU0zTVFzM25sMnRiSFFuSzZ5bThYVFVzLWQwdVIyWm1n</guid></item><item><title>Your Brain Maps Actions Like It Maps Space -神经科学新闻 | Your Brain Maps Actions Like It Maps Space - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE9KcG5MTkZHblJWWUlhNWRQRkdJTzktZElCNlUzNEFQRjlkNXFGU2YtV1BiYk9seXlLd3dmM1lPM2hCVUFwTzdxVG5wZGgta28xbUhKZENZUG50bDY3RWxNS0ViV2o4NFdTUE1iNQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study shows that the human brain organizes action-outcome associations in cognitive maps, much like how it maps physical space for navigation. These action maps are formed in the hippocampus and communicate with the motor system to support goal-directed behaviors and flexible decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using virtual reality tasks and fMRI, researchers observed that the brain represents similar actions closer together in this map-like structure, influencing how we perceive and choose between them. This challenges traditional views of memory systems, revealing that action planning is guided by interconnected neural networks that link memory, perception, and motor control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Action Maps:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain organizes actions and their outcomes using hippocampal maps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motor Integration:&lt;/strong&gt; These maps interact with the motor system to guide behavior and decision-making.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond Space:&lt;/strong&gt; The study expands the role of cognitive maps from spatial navigation to action planning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Max Planck Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are the relations between different action plans organized and structured in the brain to support our rich behavioural repertoire? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Irina Barnaveli and Christian Doeller together with Simone Viganò and Daniel Reznik from the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences and with Patrick Haggard from the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, argue in their recent study that the brain organizes action-outcome associations in a cognitive map-like structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109752"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Crucially, this cognitive map in the hippocampal system exchanges information with the motor system to relate multiple action plans to each other. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers further demonstrate in their study, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, that these cognitive maps, located in the hippocampal system, communicate with the motor system during action evaluation, suggesting that goal-directed action planning skills rely on multiple neural systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human capacity to develop a diverse and highly complex repertoire of action plans is truly remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of our behaviours are rooted in associations between actions and their outcomes, which we form and leverage flexibly. For instance, the same keypress action can lead to different outcomes depending on whether it’s performed on a computer keyboard, a radio, or another context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We often have multiple alternative choices, so that action selection requires comparing across available action-outcomes, which is a non-trivial and taxing problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How do we compare the many action plans stored in memory and select the most appropriate one?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We propose that these action-outcome associations could be organized in a cognitive map within the hippocampal system, potentially supporting efficient action selection within the rich human behavioural repertoire” explains Irina Barnaveli, first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The hippocampus is a part of the brain involved in forming memories and navigating in space. Navigation relies heavily on the creation of maps of space. Our study suggests that we create similar maps for organizing and selecting action plans, linking perception to action.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the immersive virtual reality, participants performed a motor interaction task, in which they learned how to control the flying and catching of a virtual ball using different actions. Later, they compared learned actions while their brain activity was monitored using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists found patterns of brain activity that are typically interpreted as signatures of ‘cognitive mapping’, suggesting that the brain abstracts and organizes action plans in a map-like representation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This map is also evident from participants’ behaviour: the closer the actions are within the hypothesised map, the more similar they are perceived by the participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, this cognitive map in the hippocampal system exchanges information with the motor system to relate multiple action plans to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The map-like representations might therefore represent how humans interact with their environment in a very general sense, well beyond the specific case of spatial navigation. By supporting action selection, cognitive maps could contribute to optimizing the acquisition and exploitation of a wide repertoire of action plans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This discovery further challenges the classical distinction between declarative and procedural memory, suggesting that goal-directed actions rely on multiple neural systems that integrate action generation, motor planning, and memory”, concludes Christian Doeller, last author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbs.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Bettina Hennebach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbs.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Max Planck Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Bettina Hennebach – Max Planck Institute&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59153-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hippocampal-entorhinal cognitive maps and cortical motor system represent action plans and their outcomes&lt;/a&gt;” by Irina Barnaveli et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hippocampal-entorhinal cognitive maps and cortical motor system represent action plans and their outcomes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efficiently interacting with the environment requires weighing and selecting among multiple alternative actions based on their associated outcomes. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these processes are still debated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show that forming relations between arbitrary action-outcome associations involve building a cognitive map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an immersive virtual reality paradigm, participants learned 2D abstract motor action-outcome associations and later compared action combinations while their brain activity was monitored with fMRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We observe a hexadirectional modulation of the activity in entorhinal cortex while participants compared different action plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, hippocampal activity scales with the 2D similarity between outcomes of these action plans. Conversely, the supplementary motor area represents individual actions, showing a stronger response to overlapping action plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the connectivity between hippocampus and supplementary motor area is modulated by the similarity between the action plans, suggesting their complementary roles in action evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings provide evidence for the role of cognitive maps in action selection, challenging classical models of memory taxonomy and its neural bases.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 14:46:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE9KcG5MTkZHblJWWUlhNWRQRkdJTzktZElCNlUzNEFQRjlkNXFGU2YtV1BiYk9seXlLd3dmM1lPM2hCVUFwTzdxVG5wZGgta28xbUhKZENZUG50bDY3RWxNS0ViV2o4NFdTUE1iNQ</guid></item><item><title>印度饮食指南：您只需1餐即可获得清晰的思维。以下是吃什么-印度斯坦时报（ Hindustan Times ） | Indian diet guide: You are just 1 meal away from mental clarity.

These indigenous berries are rich in antioxidants and provide similar cognitive benefits. Amla, for example, is renowned for its high vitamin C content, which supports brain health, while jamun offers anthocyanins and has been traditionally used for managing blood sugar levels, further enhancing mental clarity.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_630x354/HT/p2/2018/08/26/Pictures/_03b9ddba-a912-11e8-8937-8a80aaa2408c.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Eat right to keep your brain from ageing and to prevent dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease.(Shutterstock)" title="Eat right to keep your brain from ageing and to prevent dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease.(Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Eat right to keep your brain from ageing and to prevent dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease.(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the diet expert, turmeric, with its active compound curcumin, offers potent anti-inflammatory effects and has shown promise in reducing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. Charu Dua recommended, “Don’t overlook herbs either—sage and rosemary not only flavour your food but are also known to enhance concentration and alertness. Even small additions like walnuts, flaxseeds and pumpkin seeds deliver omega-3s and vitamin E, essential for brain health.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The idea is simple: think fresh, eat colourfully and your mind will thank you.

In a study involving over 6,000 patients, those with cancer had FaceAges about five years older than their chronological age, and higher FaceAges were linked to poorer survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tool outperformed clinicians in predicting short-term life expectancy for patients receiving palliative radiotherapy, especially when integrated into their decision-making. These findings suggest that facial features could serve as powerful, non-invasive biomarkers for aging and disease, opening new doors in precision medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FaceAge AI:&lt;/strong&gt; Predicts biological age and survival using facial photos.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancer Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Patients with cancer appeared ~5 years older than their actual age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Boost:&lt;/strong&gt; FaceAge improved doctors’ predictions of life expectancy in palliative care.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Mass General&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eyes may be the window to the soul, but a person’s biological age could be reflected in their facial characteristics. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators from Mass General Brigham developed a deep learning algorithm called FaceAge that uses a photo of a person’s face to predict biological age and survival outcomes for patients with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that patients with cancer, on average, had a higher FaceAge than those without and appeared about five years older than their chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109748"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman's face with a digital overlay." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Results showed that cancer patients appear significantly older than those without cancer, and their FaceAge, on average, was about five years older than their chronological age. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older FaceAge predictions were associated with worse overall survival outcomes across multiple cancer types. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found that FaceAge outperformed clinicians in predicting short-term life expectancies of patients receiving palliative radiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their results are published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet Digital Health&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can use artificial intelligence (AI) to estimate a person’s biological age from face pictures, and our study shows that information can be clinically meaningful,” said co-senior and corresponding author Hugo Aerts, PhD, director of the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM) program at Mass General Brigham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work demonstrates that a photo like a simple selfie contains important information that could help to inform clinical decision-making and care plans for patients and clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How old someone looks compared to their chronological age really matters—individuals with FaceAges that are younger than their chronological ages do significantly better after cancer therapy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When patients walk into exam rooms, their appearance may give physicians clues about their overall health and vitality. Those intuitive assessments combined with a patient’s chronological age, in addition to many other biological measures, may help determine the best course of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, like anyone, physicians may have biases about a person’s age that may influence them, fueling a need for more objective, predictive measures to inform care decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that goal in mind, Mass General Brigham investigators leveraged deep learning and facial recognition technologies to train FaceAge. The tool was trained on 58,851 photos of presumed healthy individuals from public datasets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team tested the algorithm in a cohort of 6,196 cancer patients from two centers, using photographs routinely taken at the start of radiotherapy treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results showed that cancer patients appear significantly older than those without cancer, and their FaceAge, on average, was about five years older than their chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the cancer patient cohort, older FaceAge was associated with worse survival outcomes, especially in individuals who appeared older than 85, even after adjusting for chronological age, sex, and cancer type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estimated survival time at the end of life is difficult to pin down but has important treatment implications in cancer care. The team asked 10 clinicians and researchers to predict short-term life expectancy from 100 photos of patients receiving palliative radiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there was a wide range in their performance, overall, the clinicians’ predictions were only slightly better than a coin flip, even after they were given clinical context, such as the patient’s chronological age and cancer status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet when clinicians were also provided with the patient’s FaceAge information, their predictions improved significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research is needed before this technology could be considered for use in a real-world clinical setting. The research team is testing this technology to predict diseases, general health status, and lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow-up studies include expanding this work across different hospitals, looking at patients in different stages of cancer, tracking FaceAge estimates over time, and testing its accuracy against plastic surgery and makeup data sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This opens the door to a whole new realm of biomarker discovery from photographs, and its potential goes far beyond cancer care or predicting age,” said co-senior author Ray Mak, MD, a faculty member in the AIM program at Mass General Brigham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we increasingly think of different chronic diseases as diseases of aging, it becomes even more important to be able to accurately predict an individual’s aging trajectory. I hope we can ultimately use this technology as an early detection system in a variety of applications, within a strong regulatory and ethical framework, to help save lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authorship:&lt;/strong&gt; Additional Mass General Brigham authors include Dennis Bontempi, Osbert Zalay, Danielle S.

In medicine, however, appearance is incorporated into medical judgements in a subjective and non-standardised way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we aimed to develop and validate FaceAge, a deep learning system to estimate biological age from easily obtainable and low-cost face photographs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;FaceAge was trained on data from 58 851 presumed healthy individuals aged 60 years or older: 56 304 individuals from the IMDb–Wiki dataset (training) and 2547 from the UTKFace dataset (initial validation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical utility was evaluated on data from 6196 patients with cancer diagnoses from two institutions in the Netherlands and the USA: the MAASTRO, Harvard Thoracic, and Harvard Palliative cohorts FaceAge estimates in these cancer cohorts were compared with a non-cancerous reference cohort of 535 individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess the prognostic relevance of FaceAge, we performed Kaplan–Meier survival analysis and Cox modelling, adjusting for several clinical covariates. We also assessed the performance of FaceAge in patients with metastatic cancer receiving palliative treatment at the end of life by incorporating FaceAge into clinical prediction models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether FaceAge has the potential to be a biomarker for molecular ageing, we performed a gene-based analysis to assess its association with senescence genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;FaceAge showed significant independent prognostic performance in various cancer types and stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking older was correlated with worse overall survival (after adjusting for covariates per-decade hazard ratio [HR] 1·151, p=0·013 in a pan-cancer cohort of n=4906; 1·148, p=0·011 in a thoracic cohort of n=573; and 1·117, p=0·021 in a palliative cohort of n=717).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that, on average, patients with cancer looked older than their chronological age (mean increase of 4·79 years with respect to non-cancerous reference cohort, p&amp;lt;0·0001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that FaceAge can improve physicians’ survival predictions in patients with incurable cancer receiving palliative treatments (from area under the curve 0·74 [95% CI 0·70–0·78] to 0·8 [0·76–0·83]; p&amp;lt;0·0001), highlighting the clinical use of the algorithm to support end-of-life decision making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FaceAge was also significantly associated with molecular mechanisms of senescence through gene analysis, whereas age was not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that a deep learning model can estimate biological age from face photographs and thereby enhance survival prediction in patients with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research, including validation in larger cohorts, is needed to verify these findings in patients with cancer and to establish whether the findings extend to patients with other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subject to further testing and validation, approaches such as FaceAge could be used to translate a patient’s visual appearance into objective, quantitative, and clinically valuable measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Funding&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;US National Institutes of Health and EU European Research Council.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 14:24:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE9pOWZURk1SYWNtcmxQVER2OHlPLTU4b01OdVp1azJKSGg4aDNHb2JZbzIzS2otejF6dGpHdVVDT0w1b3prcEx0NUZ2SVoxVFpNazdQTkZyQ1dZcGh4aXN3bmlSVmF4bVk</guid></item><item><title>秋葵和葫芦巴提取物在德克萨斯州新研究中安全去除水中的微塑料-好消息网络 | Okra and Fenugreek Extracts Safely Remove Microplastics From Water in New Texas Research - Good News Network</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivgFBVV95cUxPdjBoR0NKNkNqZE1jeUg0a2w3YmFHZHU4b3U5cnFJSElqRXl2cng2Ym5DTkFvX3cwZThfaXBlcHdtdjlsMm9yQTk5MngyN3pfcHNMZWJjbnNZQVU0MGdmSTZxRjJ0QS1id1BaR0lmQ0lvbU9IakJ5ZC0tZHVQdEk1bHVrOE1ENDRXVF8xVUYxVkZmMkVuTm54bHFIZU81MnlOQkk2U1VWaTUzZ1FEamxFb3NwUUJZTTNGcndzYmdR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The substances behind the slimy strings from okra and the gel from fenugreek seeds could trap microplastics better than a commonly used synthetic polymer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas researchers &lt;a href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/texas-researchers-use-ocra-to-remove-microplastics-from-wastewater/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;proposed in 2022&lt;/a&gt; using these sticky natural polymers to clean up water. Now, they’ve found that okra and/or fenugreek extracts attracted and removed up to 90% of microplastics from ocean water, freshwater, and groundwater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With funding from the U.S. Department of Energy, Rajani Srinivasan and colleagues at Tarleton State University found that the plant-based polymers from okra, fenugreek, and tamarind stick to microplastics, clumping together and sinking for easy separation from water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this next stage of the research, they have optimized the process for okra and fenugreek extracts and tested results in a variety of types of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To extract the sticky plant polymers, the team soaked sliced okra pods and blended fenugreek seeds in separate containers of water overnight. Then, researchers removed the dissolved extracts from each solution and dried them into powders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyses &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.4c07476" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published in&lt;/a&gt; the American Chemical Society journal showed that the powdered extracts contained polysaccharides, which are natural polymers. Initial tests in pure water spiked with microplastics showed that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One gram of either powder in a quart (one liter) of water trapped microplastics the most effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dried okra and fenugreek extracts removed 67% and 93%, respectively, of the plastic in an hour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A mixture of equal parts okra and fenugreek powder reached maximum removal efficiency (70%) within 30 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The natural polymers performed significantly better than the synthetic, commercially available polyacrylamide polymer used in wastewater treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DID YOU KNOW:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a title="There’s a Surprisingly Easy Way to Remove Microplastics From Drinking Water: Boil it" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/theres-a-surprisingly-easy-way-to-remove-microplastics-from-drinking-water-boil-it/" rel="bookmark"&gt;There’s a Surprisingly Easy Way to Remove Microplastics From Drinking Water: Boil it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the researchers tested the plant extracts on real microplastic-polluted water. They collected samples from waterbodies around Texas and brought them to the lab. The plant extract removal efficiency changed depending on the original water source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okra worked best in ocean water (80%), fenugreek in groundwater (80-90%), and the 1:1 combination of okra and fenugreek in freshwater (77%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers hypothesize that the natural polymers had different efficiencies because each water sample had different types, sizes and shapes of microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyacrylamide, which is currently used to remove contaminants during wastewater treatment, has low toxicity, but its precursor acrylamide is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyacrylamide#Environmental_effects" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;considered toxic&lt;/a&gt;. Okra and fenugreek extracts could serve as biodegradable and nontoxic alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Utilizing these plant-based extracts in water treatment will remove microplastics and other pollutants without introducing additional toxic substances to the treated water,” said Srinivasan &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1082887" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in a media release&lt;/a&gt;, “thus reducing long-term health risks to the population.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She had previously studied the use of food-grade plant extracts as non-toxic flocculants to remove textile-based pollutants from wastewater and thought, ‘Why not try microplastics?’&lt;/p&gt;

Leafy greens: The brain’s best friend&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2021/09/28/550x309/gareth-hubbard-qPcSUERqBAc-unsplash_1632801819466_1632801894035.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Leafy greens: Leafy greens are high in fibre and provide nutrition, vitamins, calcium, minerals, antioxidants to the body.(Unsplash)" title="Leafy greens: Leafy greens are high in fibre and provide nutrition, vitamins, calcium, minerals, antioxidants to the body.(Unsplash)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Leafy greens: Leafy greens are high in fibre and provide nutrition, vitamins, calcium, minerals, antioxidants to the body.(Unsplash)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leafy greens like spinach, kale, and collard greens are some of the most powerful brain boosters. They’re packed with folate and vitamin K, both of which play key roles in supporting brain plasticity and memory retention. Another green worth highlighting is broccoli, which contains glucosinolates—compounds that may slow the breakdown of acetylcholine, a brain chemical essential for learning and concentration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Berry smart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/04/28/original/berriess_1745840009776.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Berries contain antioxidants.(Shutterstock)" title="Berries contain antioxidants.(Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Berries contain antioxidants.(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blueberries, strawberries and other berries are rich in flavonoids, a group of antioxidants known to reduce oxidative stress and enhance blood flow to the brain. Regular consumption of berries has been linked to improved memory and cognitive function. Similarly, pomegranate juice offers powerful anti-inflammatory benefits thanks to its high antioxidant content.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Nuts and seeds: Small but mighty&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2022/05/28/550x309/nuts_and_seeds_1653740943830_1653740955010.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Nuts and seeds are a great source of healthy fats, antioxidants, fibre, vitamins and minerals.

Eating them daily in moderation will keep one healthy throughout the year. They are helpful in brain function, lower cholesterol and triglycerides, reduce inflammation and risk of heart attack. (Pixabay)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walnuts stand out among nuts for their high antioxidant levels and links to improved cognitive performance. Other nuts like almonds, hazelnuts, and seeds such as sunflower seeds may also support brain health, though to a slightly lesser degree.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Everyday brain foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some everyday ingredients also quietly support brain health. Dark chocolate is rich in brain-friendly flavonoids, while onions contain quercetin, which helps protect brain cells. Tomatoes, with their lycopene content, may offer additional cognitive support.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Colourful veggies and healthy fats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t overlook the power of colour. Carrots, sweet potatoes and other orange vegetables are loaded with beta-carotene, which may benefit brain function. Cruciferous veggies like cauliflower and broccoli also support mental sharpness thanks to their glucosinolate content. Pair these with a drizzle of olive oil, a healthy fat that helps your body absorb and use these antioxidants more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. A grape way to boost brainpower&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_630x354/HT/p2/2017/02/04/Pictures/cultivation-varieties-seedless-developed-superior-agricultural-university_4736bb56-eaa2-11e6-93cc-bb55973994db.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Experts suggest that grapes help support brain health by working in multiple ways - from reducing oxidative stress in the brain to promoting healthy blood flow in the brain to helping maintain levels of a key brain chemical that promotes memory to exerting anti-inflammatory effects.(HT Photo)" title="Experts suggest that grapes help support brain health by working in multiple ways - from reducing oxidative stress in the brain to promoting healthy blood flow in the brain to helping maintain levels of a key brain chemical that promotes memory to exerting anti-inflammatory effects.(HT Photo)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Experts suggest that grapes help support brain health by working in multiple ways - from reducing oxidative stress in the brain to promoting healthy blood flow in the brain to helping maintain levels of a key brain chemical that promotes memory to exerting anti-inflammatory effects.(HT Photo)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lastly, grapes, especially dark varieties, are rich in resveratrol, an antioxidant known for its potential cognitive benefits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By thinking fresh and filling your diet with these antioxidant-rich plants, you are giving your brain the nourishment it needs to stay clear, focused and energised naturally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Transplanted neurons alone improved basic motor functions, but when combined with voluntary exercise, the rats displayed significantly better agility and paw control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that exercise helped transplanted neurons mature and form stronger connections with host brain cells, likely due to an increase in beneficial brain proteins. These findings suggest that exercise could be a simple, non-invasive way to boost outcomes in future PD stem cell therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapy Synergy:&lt;/strong&gt; Exercise enhanced the function of stem cell-derived neuron transplants in PD rats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Integration:&lt;/strong&gt; Exercise promoted transplant maturation and connectivity with host neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Suggests a safe, accessible way to improve outcomes in human PD trials.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;International Society for Stem Cell Research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a disabling neurodegenerative disease that affects approximately 10 million people worldwide, with numbers steadily increasing. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include tremors, difficulties with movement and speech, as well mental health issues and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109736"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows people exercising." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/exercise-stem-cells-Parkinsons-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Their research found that voluntary exercise improved the maturation of the transplant and the establishment of connections between the transplant and the rat neurons. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although PD can be managed by medication and lifestyle adjustments, the efficacy of these interventions varies between patients and cannot stop or reverse disease progression.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PD is caused by progressive loss of a certain type of neurons in the brain which produce dopamine, a chemical substance required to control movement, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encouragingly, studies dating back to the eighties have shown that replacing lost dopaminergic neurons with donated fetal tissue-derived neurons can improve symptoms in PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, researchers have made progress in generating a replenishable source of dopaminergic neurons from pluripotent stem cells in the lab and achieved promising results when transplanting these cells in animal models of PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, clinical trials are ongoing to test the safety and efficacy of transplanting such stem cell-derived neurons in PD patients. A key to success in patients will be the successful integration and maturation of the transplanted cells within the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this, a research team led by Clare Parish from The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health (in Melbourne) and Lachlan Thompson from the University of Sydney, Australia has now tested whether exercise enhances transplant function in PD rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their study, rats received a stem cell-derived transplant to replace lost dopaminergic neurons and some of the rats were given free access to a running wheel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their work was recently published in &lt;em&gt;Stem Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the neural grafts improved gross motor function, combined with exercise saw paw movements and agility improved significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their research found that voluntary exercise improved the maturation of the transplant and the establishment of connections between the transplant and the rat neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A likely cause for this was the enhanced secretion of certain beneficial proteins in the brains of exercising rats which promoted transplant survival and integration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, exercise may be a non-invasive and easily implemented strategy to enhance treatment outcomes in PD patients in combination with stem cell-derived transplants, warranting further testing in upcoming clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Parkinson’s disease and genetics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fa9191939698958f88949fba9389899988d495889d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kym Kilbourne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://isscr.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;International Society for Stem Cell Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Kym Kilbourne – International Society for Stem Cell Research&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stemcr.2025.102480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Exercise promotes the functional integration of human stem cell-derived neural grafts in a rodent model of Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;” by Clare Parish et al. &lt;em&gt;Stem Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise promotes the functional integration of human stem cell-derived neural grafts in a rodent model of Parkinson’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived dopamine neurons can functionally integrate and reverse motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease models, motivating current clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, dopamine neuron proportions remain low and their plasticity inferior to fetal tissue grafts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence shows exercise can enhance neuron survival and plasticity, warranting investigation for hPSC-derived neural grafts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show voluntary exercise (wheel running) significantly increases graft plasticity, accelerating motor recovery in animals receiving ectopic, but not homotopic, placed grafts, suggestive of threshold requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plasticity was accompanied by increased phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK+) cells in the graft (and host), reflective of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-ERK signaling, a downstream target of glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), proteins that were also elevated. Verifying improved graft integration was the increase in cFos+ postsynaptic striatal neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings have direct implications for the adoption of physical therapy-based approaches to enhance neural transplantation outcomes in future Parkinson’s disease clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 12:58:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5CT1lfQXA2aktIZWZ1cHdFVGZwdHJXUFBOQ2REeGdISkFic05WaUQtS3FiN2dtT2lhNWFrVGg2V2ZpX05ROThFTkhIMVppV1UtZ3JqZ3dTcXVGUTladlpEY0MzcklEeTgyMmVHeWZkT01xdmIz</guid></item><item><title>他们不明白为什么他们的孩子一直生病。在罕见的诊断之后，一种新的基因疗法带来了希望。- CBS新闻 | They didn't understand why their kids kept getting sick.

    &lt;p&gt;Ava Langenhop was always sick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From "the time she was born," she was "just a sick baby," the 9-year-old's mother, Alicia Langenhop, told CBS News. She'd catch any cough or cold. Before she was two months old, she went to the hospital twice for viral infections. Ear infections were constant. Scraped knees turned into skin infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alicia and Jon Langenhop didn't understand what was causing it. They thought Alicia might be bringing illnesses home from her job at a local daycare. When their second daughter, Olivia, was born, she "followed the same path": Constant illnesses, frequent infections and multiple hospitalizations. It was grueling, the parents said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a real strain, trying to figure out whose turn is it next to stay home with the sick kid, and all the different hospital bills and doctor's visits," Alicia Langenhop said. "That was a pretty rough first three years of having kids." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Ava was three, her gums started to get inflamed and bleed during brushing. A periodontist suggested that the Langenhops test their daughters for autoimmune diseases. It was a world the young couple was completely unfamiliar with.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had to travel to Cincinnati, about four hours from where they lived in Canton, Ohio, to get tests that confirmed Ava had LAD-1. The rare disorder means a person's white blood cells are unable to enter infection sites and kill bacteria, leaving patients vulnerable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Langenhops struggled to understand the diagnosis, they got even more devastating news: Olivia, just a year old, also had the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is LAD-1, and how is it usually treated? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAD-1 symptoms start at birth, &lt;a href="https://primaryimmune.org/understanding-primary-immunodeficiency/types-of-pi/leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency-lad" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to the Immune Deficiency Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. Soft tissue infections, slow-healing wounds and gum infections are common. The lives of people diagnosed with it are "often severely shortened" because of the frequent illnesses, the foundation says. Alicia Langenhop said doctors told them not to Google the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only corrective treatment for LAD-1 is a stem cell transplant via bone marrow donation, according to the Immune Deficiency Foundation. Neither Langenhop parent was an exact match for their daughters, and the girls couldn't donate to each other since they each had the disease. There was one other familial possibility: Alicia Langenhop was pregnant. They hoped their son would be able to donate bone marrow. But when Landon Langenhop was born in October 2019, tests found that he also had LAD-1. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news left the parents "overwhelmed," the mother of three said. It also meant they had to turn to the national bone marrow donor registry. There were no exact matches for the children, and the Langenhops weren't satisfied with the odds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The success rate with a match from the registry was 75%. That didn't really sit well with us, because that's a 25% chance that each of our kids would not survive the transplant," Alicia Langenhop said. It wasn't what she and her husband wanted to hear "when talking about their lives." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During an appointment, a member of the Langenhops' care team mentioned that a doctor in Los Angeles was interested in speaking with them about a clinical trial he was helping lead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was kind of a no-brainer for us to try it, at least," Jon Langenhop said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Clinical study recap &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Langenhops enrolled in a clinical trial testing an investigational therapy developed by Rocket Pharmaceuticals. Nine patients were enrolled in the trial across three clinical sites. The group was so small because of the rarity of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Donald Kohn, a pediatric bone marrow transplant physician who led the trial site at UCLA Mattel Children's Hospital in California, said the therapy essentially allows a patient to be their own stem cell donor. That makes it safer than a bone marrow donation, Kohn said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a patient was given a chemotherapy medication to encourage their stem cells to leave the bone marrow where they form and travel into the bloodstream. Then, blood was collected and the stem cells separated from the blood cells. The stem cells were then transferred to Rocket Pharmaceuticals' laboratory. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There, the cells were cultured and injected with a virus that carries the gene that LAD-1 patients are missing, Kohn said. The patient receives another round of high-dose chemotherapy to wipe out their existing bone marrow stem cells. Then, the new stem cells are brought back to the hospital and injected back into the patient through an IV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ava was the second person to be enrolled in the trial, followed by Olivia and Landon. The family had planned to travel between California and Ohio, returning home between treatments but the COVID-19 pandemic changed that. Instead, they lived in Los Angeles for about nine months. The kids were treated one by one, and each spent about a month in the hospital while they underwent the therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was heartbreaking to see them go through it all. It was painful with the chemo and all that. It was a lot to see them go through," Alicia Langenhop said. "One of us was spending all of our time in the hospital with one kid, while the other was back at the apartment with the other two kids. We felt like we didn't have another choice. We thought, 'This is what we have to do. We're going to get through this.'" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Recovery and science &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All nine patients produced healthy immune cells capable of fighting infections, Kohn said, and are continuing to do so. None of the patients who participated in the trial have had severe infections since their treatment, he said. Six of the patients will be followed by UCLA for at least 15 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're careful not to say cured, because that implies permanence, which we don't know," Kohn said. "But as far as we follow them ... there has been no change at all in the level of the number of gene-corrected cells. It's absolutely stable." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years after participating in the study, the Langenhop children are doing well. Ava plays basketball. Olivia, a dancer and cheerleader, just celebrated her seventh birthday. Landon is playing T-ball. All three are enrolled in public school. Since they participated in the trial, none of them have had to go to the hospital, except for their annual follow-ups with Kohn.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When they had their first scraped knee or cold after the transplant and didn't get extremely sick, actually seeing it with our own eyes, really made it obvious that it was working, and that it was all worth it," Alicia Langenhop said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The therapy that the clinical trial studied is now under review with the Food and Drug Administration, UCLA &lt;a href="https://stemcell.ucla.edu/news/gene-therapy-restores-immune-function-and-extends-lives-children-rare-immune-disorder" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;said in a news release&lt;/a&gt;. The goal is to have the therapy approved as a licensed product that can be used to treat patients, Kohn said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Langenhops said they are honored that their children could help create a medication that may be used to treat others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's incredible. It's fascinating to us, because we're just normal people," Alicia Langenhop said. "When you think of the numbers and think how we had three of the nine patients that received this, and possibly because of that other kids in the future could receive this treatment, it's pretty indescribable." &lt;/p&gt;

Excessive sugar in the bloodstream can damage blood vessels, increasing the risk of artery damage and the likelihood of a &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/health" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;stroke.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An early indicator of type 2 diabetes is when wounds or cuts take an unusually long time to heal. Diabetes.co.uk explains: "High levels of blood glucose [sugar] caused by diabetes can, over time, affect the nerves (neuropathy) and lead to poor blood circulation, making it hard for blood - needed for skin repair - to reach areas of the body affected by sores or wounds."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This may cause wounds to remain open and unhealed for extended periods, heightening the risk of further complications. Particularly alarming is the slow healing of foot wounds in individuals with diabetes, which, without appropriate treatment, could escalate the risk of amputation, reports &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/type-2-diabetes-symptoms-signs-30503953" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;Surrey Live&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; highlights symptoms of type 2 diabetes: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Peeing more than usual&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Feeling thirsty all the time&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Feeling very tired&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Losing weight without trying to&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Itching around your penis or vagina, or repeatedly getting thrush&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Cuts or wounds taking longer to heal&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Blurred vision&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31579101" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The charity recommends that those with diabetes should inspect their feet daily and report any signs of damage to their healthcare team.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;b&gt;Reducing blood sugar levels&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Controlling blood glucose levels is essential to mitigate the risk of slow-healing wounds and the onset of type 2 diabetes. Dietary changes are crucial for maintaining healthy blood sugar levels, with Harvard Health suggesting a balanced diet that includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and low-fat dairy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Harvard Health explained: "Vegetables, fruits, and whole grains provide more nutrition per calorie than refined carbohydrates and tend to be rich in fibre.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Your body digests high-fibre foods more slowly - which means a more moderate rise in blood sugar."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To manage blood sugar levels, it's advised to limit or avoid highly processed carbohydrates, such as white bread, as well as sweet treats and beverages. &lt;a href="https://www.diabetes.org.uk/living-with-diabetes/eating/i-have-type-2-diabetes" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Diabetes UK&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that no two people are the same, so everyone's diet will look slightly different.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It recommended making healthier choices more often, and only have treats occasionally and in small portions. It also warned to look out for foods labelled as ‘diabetic’ or ‘suitable for diabetics’, as well as red and processed meat or highly processed carbs like white bread.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/newsletter-preference-centre/?utm_source=newslettersignupfooter" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;b&gt;If you want ideas and inspiration to plan your next UK adventure plus selected offers and competitions, sign up for our 2Chill weekly newsletter here&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 11:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPRy1xQlQxbWxSUXRQV3ZwNVRFMTMtVzhrVGtQTURhcXdUREhhSUl0ZS1tZmk3YVRTOUlHR0pGNXdpTi00cjliMGQ3QXVLM2VmVTVzU0M5OTgzckx3S0FwMW9TdlIwOVRnaWpCNmZDbXZzdkNsLTFpcHRYYWxicXJXZw</guid></item><item><title>一名大学生认为她患有鼻窦感染。她被诊断出患有一种罕见的侵袭性癌症。- Business Insider | A college student thought she had a sinus infection.

              &lt;p&gt;Breeze Hunter started off her senior year at Texas A&amp;amp;M University with a typical &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/conditions-symptoms/sinus-infection-vs-cold" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;head cold&lt;/a&gt;. She only started to worry when it lasted almost two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was tired all the time, her days dotted with shortness of breath and &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/conditions-symptoms/types-of-headaches" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;headaches&lt;/a&gt; that she'd never had before. Campus doctors told her she had a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/conditions-symptoms/chronic-sinusitis" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;sinus infection&lt;/a&gt; that was likely prolonged from the usual busyness of being a full-time student and sorority member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her symptoms progressed. After a campus doctor pushed her to get bloodwork, she learned her levels were "all over the place," Hunter, 22, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p class="newsletter-dynamic" aria-expanded="true" aria-hidden="false" data-track-view='{"element_name":"inline_newsletter","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned","subscription_experience":"bi_value_unassigned"}' data-component-type="newsletter-dynamic" data-load-strategy="lazy" data-element-name="inline_newsletter" data-source="healthinlinesignup" data-skeleton-name="generic-tout" data-acq-source=""&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Days later, at the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/grandson-grandmother-both-diagnosed-melanoma-skin-cancer-immunotherapy-2023-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;MD Anderson Cancer Center&lt;/a&gt; in Houston, doctors confirmed that she had acute myeloid &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/i-was-diagnosed-with-leukemia-after-a-minor-fall-2023-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;leukemia&lt;/a&gt; — a rare and more aggressive form of the cancer. Abnormal white blood cells grow at a rapid pace, outnumbering healthy blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As soon as we found out, we just could not believe that it was actually happening that I had cancer," Hunter said. "It's a very scary moment, and it almost doesn't feel real."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="c3371499-c6dc-48c9-8f0c-bbcc36728bb9" data-toc-id="c3371499-c6dc-48c9-8f0c-bbcc36728bb9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rushing to treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Once she was diagnosed with leukemia, treatment began immediately. The first round of &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kids-encouraged-me-to-stop-wearing-a-wig-after-chemo-2025-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;chemotherapy&lt;/a&gt; worked very well — she went from a 95% blast,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;or percentage of abnormal blood cells, to 7%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be considered &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kate-middleton-remission-cancer-diagnosis-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;in remission&lt;/a&gt;, a person with acute myeloid leukemia must have 5% or fewer blast cells in their body. Hunter did a second round of chemo, one that was "way harder" than the first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, she went straight into 11 days of radiation therapy on her brain and spine. "It burned my skin really bad," she said. "It took a big toll on my body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="7f51a400-17b9-4434-ac6f-cf59ffbd421e" data-toc-id="7f51a400-17b9-4434-ac6f-cf59ffbd421e"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'My 200 square foot mansion'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The treatments took her away from her campus life — the first chemo cycle alone involved a month-long stay at the hospital. To pass the time, she started making TikToks about her cancer experience, including a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@breezehunter/video/7438033138997153066" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;viral video&lt;/a&gt; of her parodying &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mtv-cribs-reboot-wealth-porn-isnt-appealing-now-analysis-2021-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;MTV's "Cribs"&lt;/a&gt; by giving a tour of her hospital room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunter, who didn't grow up watching the show, got the idea from her sister. They watched clips for the first time before Hunter took to the camera, sharing her makeshift closet and framed photos of her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunter leaned on her family, boyfriend, and friends during this period of time. "When you're alone, you overthink things and you think the worst of the worst," she said. "I never had that happen, which is amazing."&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

"It is very hard — we are so young and we're missing out on a lot of young adult things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="b52b2f8f-0adf-4c47-b55f-dcee8c21ac76" data-toc-id="b52b2f8f-0adf-4c47-b55f-dcee8c21ac76"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A successful cell transplant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As of December, Hunter is in remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, Hunter needed a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hiv-third-confirmed-case-cure-stem-cell-transplant-2023-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;stem cell transplant&lt;/a&gt; after chemo and radiation to replace her cancer cells with healthy ones. Her brother was a 100% donor match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transplant was completed in January and was "definitely the hardest thing I've ever done," Hunter said. In her ongoing recovery, she said she lost a lot of weight and developed mucositis, a common inflammatory condition that can develop after cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, she's slowly gaining weight back and hoping to grow out her hair. Hunter's hospital and doctors' visits have gone from daily to once a week.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Hunter, who continued to take online classes so she could recover at home with her family, received her degree in agricultural leadership and development with economics on May 9. She's excited to walk at graduation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, she's going on a vacation with her family — something she hasn't been able to do due to being &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/immunocompromised-grad-student-trying-not-catch-covid-2023-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;immunocompromised&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just going back to normal and being able to do normal things, I'm really looking forward to," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Chances are, you know someone with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or you might have it yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ADHD is a complex condition characterized by symptoms like a constant inability to pay attention, impulsiveness, trouble sleeping, and mood swings. According to the latest data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/adhd/data/index.html"&gt;estimated 7 million&lt;/a&gt; children in the U.S. (11.4% of all children) have been diagnosed with ADHD, along with 15.5 million U.S. adults (6% of the adult population)—half of whom were diagnosed as kids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These numbers aren’t fixed, however. The prevalence of diagnosed ADHD has steadily risen in the U.S. over time, and can differ significantly from state to state. Globally, ADHD rates tend to be lower than those seen in the U.S., though prevalence has been increasing in &lt;a href="https://firstwordpharma.com/story/5860647"&gt;some parts of the world&lt;/a&gt;. The reasons for this increase in diagnosed ADHD, or the differing rates across states or countries, aren’t clear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s possible that much of this increase simply reflects doctors becoming better at recognizing ADHD in children and adults over time. But ADHD is also predominantly thought to be caused by a complicated mix of genetic and environmental factors, and it’s possible that some of these factors might be on the rise. In perhaps the weakest version of that theory, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Secretary of Health and Human Services, &lt;a href="https://x.com/Acyn/status/1914785389447143471"&gt;appeared to imply&lt;/a&gt; recently—without any supporting evidence—that the rise in ADHD and other neurological conditions is being caused by food dyes or another supposed environmental toxin.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some researchers have argued that at least part of the difference in ADHD rates can be attributed to cultural perceptions of the behaviors associated with it—particularly in children—as well as other societal factors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For this Giz Asks, we reached out to psychologists, psychiatrists, and medical historians to get their take on why ADHD rates vary so widely from place to place. The following responses may have been lightly edited for clarity and grammar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Kevin Antshel&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://artsandsciences.syracuse.edu/people/faculty/antshel-phd-kevin-/"&gt;psychologist&lt;/a&gt; specializing in ADHD and other developmental conditions at Syracuse University.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of ADHD in children varies between 5% and 10% depending on the region of the world. ADHD prevalence rates are generally higher in the U.S. (closer to 10%) and lower in Europe and Asia (closer to 5%). Rather than biology, there are medical, social/cultural and educational explanations as to why ADHD is more common in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical:&lt;/strong&gt; Children in the U.S. are more often screened for ADHD by primary care physicians than in some other places in the world. In addition, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is used to diagnose ADHD in the U.S. and has a wider diagnostic criteria for ADHD than the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) which is used in most other parts of the world. Finally, the U.S. is one of only two countries (New Zealand is the other) which allows direct-to-consumer advertising of medications. This increased awareness of treatment options likely contributes to higher diagnosis (and medication rates). All three of these medical explanations sets the stage for ADHD to be more often diagnosed in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social/Cultural:&lt;/strong&gt; In the U.S., ADHD is widely known and discussed. This increased awareness can lead to caregivers and teachers noticing inattentive and/or hyperactive- impulsive symptoms more frequently. These behaviors might then be quickly labeled as “disordered” rather than considered as within the range of typical child development. In comparison to other places in the world (especially Asia), there is somewhat lower stigma regarding ADHD in the U.S. The relatively lower level of stigma can lead to more caregivers seeking and accepting ADHD treatment. Finally, K-12 U.S. schools often emphasize self-control in the classroom (e.g., stay seated for 6+ hours per day). This emphasis on self-control may make ADHD-like behaviors more noticeable in school. All three of these social/cultural explanations sets the stage for ADHD to be more often diagnosed in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Educational:&lt;/strong&gt; In the U.S., an ADHD diagnosis can lead to the provision of school services, resources, and accommodations. This can lead to an inherent incentive to diagnose the condition. In my opinion, this is likely the greatest single influence on the higher ADHD prevalence rates that are commonly reported in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Matthew Smith&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Professor of health history at the University of Strathclyde’s Center for the Social History of Health and Healthcare and author of the 2011 book &lt;a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/H/bo14444518.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hyperactive: The Controversial History of ADHD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons ADHD is most commonly diagnosed in the United States is that it is where it was first diagnosed. Whereas most countries began diagnosing ADHD in the 1980s and more often in the 1990s, American children were first diagnosed with what we’d recognize as ADHD in the late 1950s. That is when the term Hyperkinetic Impulse Disorder was coined. Previously, hyperactive, impulsive children were only thought to be problematic when their behaviors were very severe or associated with underlying brain damage. Of more concern to child experts were shy, inactive, withdrawn, and nervous children. In contrast, Hyperkinetic Impulse Disorder, coined in 1957, was depicted as common, occurring in most classrooms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Following the Soviet launch of Sputnik (also in 1957), Americans grew concerned about why they appeared to be lagging behind in the Space Race. The National Defense Education Act was passed in the next year, placing more focus on core subjects, encouraging students to stay in school or college for longer, and hiring guidance counsellors to identify under-achievers. Those singled out as not meeting expectations were often diagnosed with Hyperkinetic Impulse Disorder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, the manufacturer of the drug Ritalin was looking for a market. It was approved to treat hyperactive children in 1961, spurring an aggressive marketing campaign that promoted not only the drug, but the disorder it was meant to treat. While some of the tactics employed by drug companies were restricted in the 1970s, the advent of direct-to-consumer advertising in the 1980s and 1990s boosted the popularity of the disorder, now called ADHD, even further.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alongside these factors, we also have to consider the environmental factors thought to contribute to ADHD behaviors, ranging from synthetic food additives and exposure to atmospheric lead, to lack of exercise and time in nature. Many of these contributing factors have been and continue to be more significant in the U.S. than in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Joel Nigg&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/people/joel-t-nigg-phd"&gt;Professor of psychiatry and co-director&lt;/a&gt; of the Center for Mental Health Innovation at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University’s School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The usual scientific opening and the boring answer: a combination of multiple secular [long-term, non-cyclical] factors. But we can name some of them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, laws are different. For example, in the U.S., educational laws mean that a diagnosis of ADHD can enable resources to be marshaled for children struggling in school—thus it really matters if a child has a diagnosis of ADHD and when they struggle in school, this gets looked at much more quickly than in other countries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, treatment guidelines are different across countries. In some countries, medication is only rarely prescribed to children, but guidelines in other countries, including the U.S., encourage use of medication as a first line treatment due to its low cost, general efficacy, and limited availability of other options.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Third, the quality of the health care system matters. The U.S. system is patchy at best, and so it is often not possible for a child to get the support they need—what appears as ADHD may be better seen as another issue, but the resources to identify and support other issues are insufficient, and ADHD becomes the “low hanging fruit” to address.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fourth, clinician ideas of how to diagnose ADHD, and at what threshold to do so, vary widely. Even within a single state in the U.S., we have seen that rates of identification of ADHD vary markedly from one county to another. The best studies I have seen indicate that cross-national differences in true prevalence (as distinct from case identification) are small (ranging from 2% to 4% or so), whereas case identification rates vary much more widely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although genetic influences are extremely important in ADHD, environmental exposures also matter to etiology. (We have not seen any evidence so far that population genetic variation is sufficient to affect prevalence). Thus, although not well demonstrated, it is likely that regional differences in relevant risk factors (for example, air pollution, ambient lead exposure, poverty and resource availability for families, maternal health during gestation and perinatal health, rates of family trauma) also account for within-country regional variation, as well as partly influencing cross-national variation in both true prevalence and case identification of ADHD or ADHD-like problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Stephen Hinshaw&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://psychology.berkeley.edu/people/stephen-hinshaw"&gt;Distinguished professor of psychology&lt;/a&gt; at the University of California, Berkeley and director of the Berkeley Girls with ADHD Longitudinal Study, the longest follow-up study of its kind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is the latest name for a constellation of problems and impairments that have been professionally recognized since the advent of compulsory education. It’s controversial—particularly because, just as is the case with other mental and neurodevelopmental conditions there is no objective biological “marker” (as there is for coronary artery disease or cancer) to pinpoint its presence. Nonetheless, an individual with levels of attention dysregulation, impulse control problems, and difficulty organizing one’s life may well display, over time, impairments in academic performance, social interactions, job performance, and regulation of emotions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And for those who might think that ADHD is a convenient label for lax parenting or difficult schools, there is a ton of evidence that the later-life issues they experience too often include low self-image, either aggressive or depressive behaviors, high risk for accidental injuries, and especially for girls, high rates of unplanned pregnancies, exposure to intimate partner violence, and self-inflicted injury (including both non-suicidal self injury and actual suicidal behavior).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why some people have high levels of ADHD but most do not is related far more to genetic differences across individuals than to differences in family interactions or contexts. Thus, ADHD (via twin and adoption studies) is significantly heritable. Still, even if one has the genetic predisposition (spanning many genes, each operating to produce a small amount of risk), how one is parented and schooled can go a long way toward exacerbating or instead minimizing impact via building of strengths.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;International studies over the past 17 years have found, intriguingly, that in countries with compulsory education, the rates of diagnosed ADHD in children and teens are remarkably consistent—comprising around 5 to 8% of the population of young people. This provides circumstantial evidence for the proposition that when youth with genetic propensities for an exploratory, impulsive style are made to go to compulsory education, a remarkably similar percentage have real difficulties with self-control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, two countries with rates of diagnosed prevalence well above these international rates are the U.S. and Israel—both of which have extreme levels of academic pressure to succeed. In fact, in a book I co-authored with the health economist Richard Scheffler, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-adhd-explosion-9780199790555?cc=us&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;"&gt;The ADHD Explosion&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; we found that the underlying major differences in ADHD diagnostic rates across U.S. states could be pinned to state-by-state differences in educational policies related to district-wide standardized test scores. That is, in states that suddenly mandated certain levels of academic performance in order to maintain state support for those districts, rates of ADHD diagnoses rose precipitously over the ensuing years—because of pressure to get such youth treated and because of policies at the time that excluded youth diagnosed with ADHD from being counted in the district’s test-score average (because these were now “special ed” kids).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall, despite the psychobiological reality of ADHD, when carefully assessed, it may well be that social and cultural pressures to “perform” can falsely inflate rates of diagnosis (a) when there is pressure on public schools to produce better test scores at all costs and (b) given the tendencies for many non-specialist professionals to yield a quick diagnosis in absence of the needed time and effort to make a valid diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, though you didn’t ask, there’s been a 100-year-long ignoring and discounting of the possibility that girls and women can “have” ADHD. A lot of work in my lab has shown this to be a myth: Boys ARE about twice as likely as girls to develop ADHD, but this is wildly different from the supposed 10:1 difference so often posited. Girls tend to show a less ornery and overt form of ADHD than boys—and professionals must catch up with the latest diagnostic standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever struggled to pick out your friend's voice over other conversations in a crowded room? Scientists call this challenge the "cocktail party problem," and it can be especially difficult for people with hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most hearing aids come with directional filters that help users focus on sounds in front of them. They're best at reducing static background noise, but falter in more complex acoustic scenarios, such as when the user is among cocktail-party guests who are standing close together and speaking at a similar volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new algorithm could improve how hearing aids tackle the cocktail party problem. The model, dubbed the "biologically oriented sound segregation algorithm" (BOSSA), draws inspiration from the brain's auditory system, which uses inputs from both ears to locate the source of a noise and can filter out sound by location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alex-Boyd-12" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alex-Boyd-12" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alexander Boyd&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a doctoral student in biomedical engineering at Boston University, compared directional filters and BOSSA to flashlights, in that they highlight what is in their path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/anatomy/vestigial-human-ear-wiggling-muscle-actually-flexes-when-were-straining-to-hear" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/anatomy/vestigial-human-ear-wiggling-muscle-actually-flexes-when-were-straining-to-hear"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'Vestigial' human ear-wiggling muscle actually flexes when we're straining to hear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"BOSSA is a new flashlight that has a tighter beam that's more selective," he told Live Science. Compared with the standard filters, BOSSA should be better at distinguishing between speakers — though it still needs to be tested in real-world scenarios with proper hearing aids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boyd led a recent lab test of BOSSA, whose results were published April 22 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_4102477377076216158&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs44172-025-00414-5&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fneuroscience%2Fsolution-to-cocktail-party-problem-could-help-people-with-hearing-loss" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44172-025-00414-5" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs44172-025-00414-5&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fneuroscience%2Fsolution-to-cocktail-party-problem-could-help-people-with-hearing-loss" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Communications Engineering&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In the experiment, participants with hearing loss donned headphones playing audio designed to simulate five people speaking simultaneously and from different angles around the listener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-VGjPbTiAwTkHAuQ6MZZFb9" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-VGjPbTiAwTkHAuQ6MZZFb9 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The audio was filtered through either BOSSA or a more traditional hearing-aid algorithm, and the participants compared both filters to how they heard the audio without additional processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each trial, participants were asked to follow sentences spoken by one of the five speakers. The volume of the "target speaker" relative to the other speakers varied between trials. When the target speaker was standing within 30 degrees of the listener in either direction, the participants could make out a greater proportion of words at a lower volume threshold with BOSSA than with the conventional algorithm or when unassisted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conventional algorithm did seem to serve users better than BOSSA in distinguishing speech from static noise. However, this was tested in only four of the eight participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The standard algorithm works by reducing distracting sounds by boosting the signal-to-noise ratio for sounds coming from a given direction. By comparison, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2022.1004071/full" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2022.1004071/full" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;BOSSA transforms sound waves&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into spikes of input that the algorithm can process, similar to how the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK531483/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK531483/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cochlea&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the inner ear converts vibrations from sound waves into signals transmitted by neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The algorithm emulates how special cells in the midbrain — the uppermost portion of the brainstem that connects the brain and spinal cord — respond selectively to sounds coming from a given direction. These spatially tuned cells judge direction based on differences in the timing and volume of sound inputs to each ear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boyd said this aspect of BOSSA drew from studies of the midbrain in barn owls, which have sophisticated spatial sensing abilities since they rely on sound cues to locate prey. The BOSSA-filtered signals are then reconstructed into sound for the listener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSSA is modeled on the nervous system's "bottom up" attention pathway, which gathers bits of sensory information that are then interpreted by the brain. These sensory inputs govern which aspects of the environment warrant focus and which can be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/evolution/our-outer-ears-may-have-come-from-ancient-fish-gills-scientists-discover" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/evolution/our-outer-ears-may-have-come-from-ancient-fish-gills-scientists-discover"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our outer ears may have come from ancient fish gills, scientists discover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But attention is also dictated by a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1073858413514136?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" target="_blank" data-url="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1073858413514136?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;"top down" pathway&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which a person's prior knowledge and current goals shape their perception. In this case, an individual can decide what is relevant to focus on. These two modes of processing aren't necessarily mutually exclusive; for instance, your friend's voice might jump out at you both because you recognize it and because they're shouting over the sound of a crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSSA's "bottom-up" approach can help people focus on speech coming from a predetermined location, but in real life, people rapidly shift their attention to different conversations. "You can't do that with this algorithm," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/michael.stone" target="_blank" data-url="https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/michael.stone" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Michael Stone&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an audiology researcher at the University of Manchester in the U.K. who was not involved in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stone added that the study didn't replicate how sounds echo and reverberate in real life, especially in indoor settings. Still, he said BOSSA could be more practical for hearing aids than algorithms based on deep neural networks, another emerging approach to sound filtering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep neural network models need extensive training to be prepared for all the different configurations of speakers the user may encounter. And once implemented, the computational demands of these models require a lot of power. BOSSA is simpler by comparison, relying mainly on the spatial difference between two sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSSA may also be more transparent than the "black box" of deep neural networks, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://faculty.uci.edu/profile/?facultyId=4560" target="_blank" data-url="https://faculty.uci.edu/profile/?facultyId=4560" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fan-Gang Zeng&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, professor of otolaryngology at University of California, Irvine, who was not involved with the research. That means it would be easier to interpret how sound inputs become algorithmic outputs, perhaps making the model simpler to refine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zeng added that BOSSA may require further refining as it is studied in more-realistic scenarios. The researchers plan to test BOSSA in proper hearing aids, rather than in headphones, and also hope to develop a steering mechanism to help users direct the algorithm's focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-VGjPbTiAwTkHAuQ6MZZFb9-wqy1seEbsGF5xWu6NN9XM8MVaebMM6HI" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-VGjPbTiAwTkHAuQ6MZZFb9-wqy1seEbsGF5xWu6NN9XM8MVaebMM6HI slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

There is now one more on that list in Maryland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;It’s called babesia and it causes something potentially terrible called babesiosis. That’s buh-bee-zee-oh-sis, if you’re seeing that for the first time — and pretty sure you are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;For years, there had only been a really small number of infections, so most doctors likely haven’t even seen a case. Recently, however, researchers found there is a growing number of these microscopic parasites in ticks in the mid-Atlantic area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;And Baltimore “is a hotspot,” said Ellen Stromdahl, a retired tick researcher from the Defense Centers for Public Health at U.S. Army Aberdeen Proving Ground who helped lead a study published last year in the &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1082221" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1082221"&gt;Journal of Entomology.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__inline-ad"&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__ad__text"&gt;The Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. &lt;a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/advertising/"&gt;Become one.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;The term hotspot is relative. The Maryland Department of Health identified only 29 infections in 2023 around the whole state, and some likely weren’t infected here. State officials said they don’t yet have 2024 numbers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;By comparison, in 2023, there were 2,463 cases of Lyme disease, also tick-borne. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;“There are not many cases, but we think it’s the tip of the iceberg and we want to give an early warning,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;And that’s the issue. Ticks are an increasing risk to people. And finding a new parasite once largely only found in northern states is troublesome to experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;That includes Dr. David Sullivan, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__inline-ad"&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__ad__text"&gt;The Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. &lt;a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/advertising/"&gt;Become one.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;“It’s an indication that Lyme is going up if we’re finding babesia. It’s a proxy indicator for Lyme and for other diseases,” he said. “I’m more worried about ticks in Maryland than mosquitoes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;The parasites causing babesiosis are spread by blacklegged, or deer, ticks. They infiltrate red blood cells and can lead to a dangerous, or rarely, even deadly level of anemia, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;The good news is a lot of people never know they have it. No symptoms and no repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;The bad news is that doctors may mistake the symptoms in people who do get sick for the flu or another malady that causes fever, body aches and fatigue. Misdiagnosis could mean a physician might not treat it properly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Those at risk of a bad outcome are elderly and immunocompromised, experts say. Treatment to avoid more serious problems includes a combination of antiparasitic medications and antibiotics. It could also require a blood transfusion in more severe cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__inline-ad"&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__ad__text"&gt;The Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. &lt;a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/advertising/"&gt;Become one.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Another hitch is that people can get infected at the same time with the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. Doctors may diagnose Lyme and prescribe antibiotics only, which will not knock out the parasites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Stromdahl and other researchers, including some from the Maryland Department of Health, set out on a two-year quest to collect and test ticks in the area after routine testing in her military lab years ago found the parasite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;They wanted to know if the parasite endemic in New England and other northern states and the Upper Midwest had found their way south. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;They are now in Maryland, Delaware, Virginia and West Virginia. In Maryland, they are most often found on the Eastern Shore of Maryland and Virginia, as well as the Baltimore region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Stromdahl wants to get the word out that the tick mix here now includes babesiosis, and doctors ought to order blood tests for those with symptoms and a tick bite. “It could save their lives,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__inline-ad"&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__ad__text"&gt;The Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. &lt;a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/advertising/"&gt;Become one.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Sullivan noted that the threat remains low for now. Marylanders may still have a better chance of being struck by lightning than getting sick with babesiosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Of the ticks tested in Maryland in the study, less than 3% had the parasites for babesiosis, compared to about 20% to 30% with the bacteria for Lyme. Only one of six species, the deer tick, is responsible for the diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Also, an infection typically requires the tick to be attached for about 24 to 36 hours for transmission, and most people’s healthy immune systems clear it from the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;The bottom line: If you see a tick and remove it within a day, you’re probably good, said Sullivan, and that goes for adult and baby ticks this time of year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-testid="header-container"&gt;A note about those ticks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;The CDC advises that if you do find a tick, carefully pluck it off with tweezers and douse it with alcohol to kill it and place it in a sealed bag. You may be eligible for a preemptive Lyme treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;And also, this time of year it’s a good idea to &lt;a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/community/public-health/tick-season-lyme-disease-maryland-52LZRTLPSJGXZKNOER6BHH5HMU/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/community/public-health/tick-season-lyme-disease-maryland-52LZRTLPSJGXZKNOER6BHH5HMU/"&gt;use tick repellent and clothes that cover you up&lt;/a&gt; when you’re in tick-prone areas outside. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Baltimore Banner</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 09:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxQX0hYdDBudmpFSnJXWkVFVlBobVZjQVJua0htbkpDal9WeVc0V3JUVGRIQVg1b1A2RnJNMWE4MEh1YkxvYTQxcnFiNS1aVVJJYm0xSEVDZnhLaEUzbmlDakJMRVF6U3pTR2VUYWZVUkZJSGkxNld3SE9vamx3R1pCTndiQkl5S29iaHItRlpUWlU2bEJacTdpQWNDSTNUeUY3MjhuTXNfelVsaWwzZUhHeHI1Y3pORzQ</guid></item><item><title>自闭症诊断正在上升–但自闭症本身可能不是-英国广播公司 | Autism diagnoses are on the rise – but autism itself may not be - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxNTFoxRXFmaHJBSEQ1RWU1OEdUWVlvUDJ2RERSTl92Ry1sWHVRQzh5U05SNTVhVkZNY2xNSUZNSEdYNExpaW5PVm12eFJxRzltOUlWTjBLQnRLRy1uMGxTamFpdVVuMVBPTkV5RV9fbXVPMFdKQlNPbmh3eUctSEdkVkIwVVlQZUk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-737179d2-0 dAzQyd"&gt;Autism diagnoses are on the rise – but autism itself may not be&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250428-123652-7bc49a8f4-web-2.20.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l99h3z.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l99h3z.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l99h3z.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l99h3z.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l99h3z.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l99h3z.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l99h3z.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l99h3z.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l99h3z.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l99h3z.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A woman holding up a dog for a child to interact with (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;(Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="autism-is-better-known-and-diagnosed-than-ever-before,-leading-to-misconceptions-that-cases-are-skyrocketing." class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;Autism is better known and diagnosed than ever before, leading to misconceptions that cases are skyrocketing.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;And some of these criteria had been noticed by other people. As a toddler, Leo rarely made eye contact. In nursery school, he didn't respond to speech like the other kids. He frequently showed compulsive behaviours, like flapping his hands and chewing his clothes. He was easily stressed or overwhelmed. As a result, his diagnosis in 2003, at age two, was relatively straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But Rosa wasn't given much guidance about next steps. "I felt very lost," says Rosa, an editor and mother of three who lives in California. "I was really angry." Like so many other parents, what she wanted to know, above all, was why her child had autism. Online, she found other parents seeking the same answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Over the years, Rosa realised she had been mistaken. Not only did Rosa eventually renounce her opposition to vaccination, she started a website, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://thinkingautismguide.com/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Thinking Person's Guide to Autism&lt;/a&gt;, to help others. "I have sympathy for people who believe this stuff because I've been there," she says. "But now I know that that was misinformation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250428-123652-7bc49a8f4-web-2.20.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l99hb9.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l99hb9.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l99hb9.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l99hb9.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l99hb9.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l99hb9.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l99hb9.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l99hb9.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l99hb9.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l99hb9.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Even today, some places have much higher rates of autism diagnoses than others (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Even today, some places have much higher rates of autism diagnoses than others (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Rosa's story is an example of how, following an autism diagnosis, some families just want clear answers. Earlier this year, the US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr promised a "massive" research effort involving hundreds of scientists, to get to the bottom of what he has called an &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj0z9nmzvdlo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;autism "epidemic"&lt;/a&gt; before September 2025.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"That can look alarming to people who don't know [the context of the statistics]", says Zoe Gross, the director of advocacy at the Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN), a US nonprofit run by autistic people. It's not necessarily that autism cases are increasing, Gross emphasises: rather, diagnoses are on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;Screenings for autism have become more sensitive, and many children are getting screened and identified earlier than in past years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As a recognised separate condition, autism is relatively new. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531066/#CR89" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;It wasn't included&lt;/a&gt; in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) – a book with details on the symptoms and recommended treatment of hundreds of mental conditions – until 1980. This means that before then, children with ASD often got misdiagnosed with a condition like schizophrenia, or were never diagnosed at all, Gross says. But even this recognition proved narrow. The 1980 &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pages.uoregon.edu/eherman/teaching/texts/DSM-I%20-%20DSM-IV%20diagnostic%20criteria.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;criteria included&lt;/a&gt;, for example, an onset before 30 months of age, lack of responsiveness to other people, and language delays – and all of the criteria listed had to be met to receive a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In the 45 years since, the diagnostic criteria for autism have broadened. An especially big shift came in 2013, when, for the first time, the DSM brought subcategories including Asperger's syndrome &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8531066/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;under the umbrella of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)&lt;/a&gt;. People who wouldn't previously have received an autism diagnosis now are more likely to meet the criteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250428-123652-7bc49a8f4-web-2.20.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l99hfj.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Autism is highly heritable, but even among identical twins both may not develop it (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Autism is highly heritable, but even among identical twins both may not develop it (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In particular, people have a better understanding of the varied ways that autism may be visible – including in "people who might not have been caught in previous years, who maybe have less intense support needs", Gross says. This is true in many parts of the world. Yun-Joo Koh, the principal investigator at the Korea Institute for Children's Social Development, says that in this country, many parents are learning about ASD through social media and coming to her clinic earlier than they used to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;All of this means fewer hidden cases of autism.

That means that, across a population, roughly 80% of the differences in ASD risk are due to genetic variation. In other words, genetics are behind most ASD cases. His research in Sweden has found that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11024771/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;it's especially heritable among boys&lt;/a&gt;: 87% for boys and 75.7% for girls. As with so many aspects of autism epidemiology, it's not clear why, Sandin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But what does seem clear from his work, including &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1866100" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;one of his Swedish studies&lt;/a&gt;, is that autism runs in families. Children whose full sibling had autism were 10 times as likely to have autism themselves, compared to children whose siblings did not have autism. If a half-sibling had autism, children were three times as likely to have the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Studies of identical twins have found that if one individual has ASD, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7355281/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;65 to 90%&lt;/a&gt; of their twins also have it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But knowing that autism is heritable does not mean any one gene is responsible in everyone who has it. In fact, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/strategic-plan/2023/strategic_plan_2023.pdf?ver=8#page=50" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;more than 100 genes&lt;/a&gt; have been identified as having some connection to autism diagnosis – although these are not necessarily specific to autism, and there are often links to other conditions. In some people, it’s thought that there might be &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/future/article/20250415-the-genetic-mystery-of-why-some-people-develop-autism" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;thousands of genes involved&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-737179d2-0 erjHHi"&gt;&lt;span id="the-role-of-environment" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="the-role-of-environment" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;The role of environment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But genetics aren't the whole story.

But these have proven difficult to untangle – it's not clear whether maternal BMI directly contributes to autism, for example, or if it's just that older mothers tend to have higher BMIs, Sandin says – and may be related to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03479-5" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;shared environmental conditions&lt;/a&gt; rather than a direct link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It is possible that at least some of these risk factors, while probably minor players individually, could be more substantial when added together. But overall, experts agree that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/strategic-plan/2023/strategic_plan_2023.pdf?ver=8#page=50" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;most environmental factors need to be researched further&lt;/a&gt; before reaching conclusions. What has been conclusively &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003143" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;ruled out&lt;/a&gt; is any link between vaccines – including certain &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/autism-spectrum-disorders" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt; some contain – and ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This is unsatisfying to many, Gross points out. "A lot of people are looking for a simple explanation, especially when autism is stigmatised, when they have been told many negative things about for maybe their own child's disability, and they want not only an explanation but something to blame."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The resulting vacuum has created space for simplistic ideas to spread – even those that lack evidence and have been repeatedly debunked. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1708223" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;In the US&lt;/a&gt;, for example, where the current measles outbreak has &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm2nzyjgrwxo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;claimed multiple lives&lt;/a&gt;, children whose older siblings have ASD are less likely to be vaccinated themselves against measles, mumps and rubella – &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1708223" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;likely due in part&lt;/a&gt; to the long-debunked link between autism and vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;One reason it's common to be alarmed about increasing autism diagnoses, says Gross, is that societies generally haven't built sufficient support systems to accompany a diagnosis. A way to make an autism diagnosis less scary would be to improve the support, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Rosa agrees. The real crisis, she says, is not of autism, but care and support – which she's found lacking for Leo, who is today a 24-year-old who loves hiking and pizza. As Rosa continues seeking the best ways to support her son, researchers will continue unravelling the science of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 09:01:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNTFoxRXFmaHJBSEQ1RWU1OEdUWVlvUDJ2RERSTl92Ry1sWHVRQzh5U05SNTVhVkZNY2xNSUZNSEdYNExpaW5PVm12eFJxRzltOUlWTjBLQnRLRy1uMGxTamFpdVVuMVBPTkV5RV9fbXVPMFdKQlNPbmh3eUctSEdkVkIwVVlQZUk</guid></item><item><title>与春季过敏一起享受的8种文学“经典” -《纽约时报》 | 8 Literary ‘Classics’ to Enjoy With Your Spring Allergies - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxOZUx1UW1jY2VRWW53c2hHMjNMaFp5YVpsaUdzZDVPVkduUk03NHNJVkFvcTFVUG5kQXpPNDlnX2ItZVVkajVOaXNIMGhkaVBNQjdhc1VLU1VUTEVJZ1U5X1dJSTFidjdid0hxN095ZFl0RzU5V18yQmpQZWhFQ21FbmpqcHJrQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="story" class="css-1y7abph e1lmdhsb0"&gt;&lt;p class="css-wqhysl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;header class="css-ay91f9 euiyums1"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1vkm6nb ehdk2mb0"&gt;&lt;h1 id="link-3c98706d" class="css-1uc375s e1h9rw200" data-testid="headline"&gt;8 Literary ‘Classics’ to Enjoy With Your Spring Allergies&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-summary" class="css-79rysd e1wiw3jv0"&gt;A tale of pollen and prejudice, and more.

Right from our bones to our immune system, Vitamin D is one of the most crucial compounds needed for our body. Strangely, even in a tropical country like ours that gets ample sunshine, we are still quite deficient in Vitamin D, due to limited sun exposure, constant air conditioning (which blocks out natural light), and indoor activities.However, when it comes to Vitamin D, is sunlight (which also causes sun damage) better than supplements? Let’s explore how sunlight and supplements compare, and whether 10 minutes in the sun can give you better vitamin D than pills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Basics first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not many know that the sun directly does not give you Vitamin D. When your skin is exposed to sunlight, specifically UVB rays, it makes vitamin D naturally. For this, the skin uses a cholesterol-related substance and turns it into vitamin D3, which then becomes active in your body after processing in the liver and kidneys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This natural process is the main way humans have gotten vitamin D for thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Is 10 minute of sunlight enough?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This question has no straight answer. The amount of vitamin D your skin makes depends on many things - time of day, skin color, where you live, and how much skin is exposed. Sunlight is strongest between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., so short exposure during these hours helps produce vitamin D. (with sunscreen on your face) On the other hand, 10 minutes might be enough for some people but not for others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, people with darker skin need more sun exposure to make the same amount of vitamin D as lighter-skinned people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How do supplements compare?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D pills, usually vitamin D3, are an easy way to increase vitamin D levels. Studies show that supplements can raise vitamin D level quickly and effectively than sun exposure alone, especially if sun exposure is limited or inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sunlight or Pills?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both sunlight and supplements effectively increase vitamin D, but they work differently. Sunlight provides vitamin D naturally and may have additional health benefits beyond vitamin D production, such as improving mood and immune function. However, relying only on sunlight is generally not recommended because of weather, (cold, grey, rainy etc), location, skin type, and risk of skin damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplements are a reliable way to maintain vitamin D levels, especially in winter, or for people who spend most time indoors. Doctors recommend using sunscreen to protect against skin cancer, which can reduce vitamin D production (but not eradicate it completely) So, supplements help fill the gap when sun exposure is not enough or safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Balance Is Key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standing in the sun for 10 minutes can help your body make vitamin D, but it might not always be enough, depending on your skin and environment. Vitamin D supplements are a safe and effective way to boost your levels, especially if you cannot get regular sun exposure. However, before starting a supplement, consult your doctor first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 08:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwJBVV95cUxOQll0TlFxR2tRWklSdy1rSUNlUnNXNWpwSUx1aWZ1VEJZc3VTckFiRDJoTmhUWXAwSVFlXzc4OWxiOVR6dkdvbW1yTG1xWi1zOGRGbThQNGpDeHl4MHhJMXYtc2hOaGhTVm81R2FDRVB4eDBoMnBxcjdEQlVBSk9CdDR0aHdONXBEQ0JlaFg3NlhmNGV4TGVjYUI5VHpyRjBWVDZrSldPa1I1WlprNGI3ejE4YWtTVEFpMXJJcmZReE96UmxYM1dNblBERHQ5U0hzM0loZXNpODVWSno2VGk5b1RzQklrLXhjb0dzQWhIdEQ5bmk0RFZCX2lWeU1hV2FpUUxLQkk1RHBBUWM</guid></item><item><title>青少年有常见的疼痛，她认为是由骑自行车引起的-这是致命的4期癌症-每日邮报 | Teenager had common pain she thought was caused by cycling - it was killer stage 4 cancer - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxOaUU3bTJGelF3SGNSbm10Q2VEYTRtX1RUU1lqMkEwdlJidERSd3ZQTjVJX1dCZnBUMjhUNWhFRVp2S21hSTdpdGpmWVNxWGtCVGtUMGFwclBRWm5GZzBBUjNzY2JqVUVHdUZsZVEyWml3OVpheVNJM2ZWZGJQVTJaTkJQRUVOQlF4dWNBb0Rqek8yUlJ3UDZOZ2JVdFhicWlO0gGmAUFVX3lxTE8wTmtWbUd6ZVZpTFhVWEdxbGdvQloxQW50LW1JUHBFNFJDS2pHcERIc2hkRE9ndGNzMURGcWVjbkdzSk55dDRxSnlLNldSRllDMW1rVUNfSmdRTGRxVGUwS2ZmbmdOeVZDYmo0NmpSaEZlcFFaTDFTWnJpRzEzMldISmxHQkRUNWpVZS1QWUVBYUNnZk9aM2FZVmZTVzdSNXE5QmU2cHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The heartbroken mother of a 15-year-old has told of her shock at learning her teenager may succumb to late stage bone &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-247d73b0-2ccb-11f0-8f00-edd81b9fdb90"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, despite suffering virtually no symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Millie Dennett, from Poole, Dorset, was a perfectly healthy student when, last month, she fell off her bicycle while out cycling with her father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Soon afterwards she developed a pain in her arm, which the family assumed was a result of the accident. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when the sensation intensified, her mother Kristina, a 38 year-old carer, decided to take her daughter to A&amp;amp;E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors performed a series of tests including several X-rays, before sending the pair home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But later that evening doctors called Ms Dennett to ask her to bring Millie back to the hospital for an emergency MRI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After spotting a worrying pattern on the scan, the family were referred to a &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-35d54d40-2ccb-11f0-8f00-edd81b9fdb90"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; hospital for a biopsy that eventually revealed the devastating truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Millie was diagnosed with stage four osteosarcoma—bone cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, brain, or other bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Healthy and fit Millie Dennett, 15, from Poole, Dorset, was diagnosed with stage four bone cancer after she developed arm pain when she fell off her bike only a few weeks ago in April&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;But Millie and her mother Krista, 38, insisted there were zero warning signs of the tumor in her arm—which had already spread to her chest at a staggering 11 centimetres. Doctors also suspect there is one in her elbow too&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors discovered that the disease had migrated to her chest, and they suspect there is cancer in &lt;span&gt;her elbow too. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I felt absolutely sick, it was the worst day of my life,' Ms Dennett said of the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's all just happened so quickly.

If you're not especially keen on the gym, this might seem like bad news - the solution is frequent exercise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A recent investigation by the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)00184-9/abstract" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Norwegian University of Science and Technology&lt;/a&gt; has delved into various human and animal studies, shedding light on how physical health can influence brain ageing. This research scrutinised factors such as brain plasticity, inflammation, and blood flow, which all play a role in the progression of neurodegenerative conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite existing guidelines advising 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise every week, researchers posit that even minimal amounts can have a positive impact on brain health. They hope that highlighting this fact will motivate individuals to commence their fitness journeys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Professor Ulrik Wisløff, who co-authored the research, &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1082648" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;: "We believe it's time for health authorities to provide clearer advice on how important exercise is for the brain. Our review shows that even small doses of high-intensity activity – equivalent to brisk walking where you can't sing – can reduce the risk of dementia by up to 40%."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Postdoctoral researcher, Atefe Rafiee Tari, also told&lt;a href="https://norwegianscitechnews.com/2025/04/exercise-helps-improve-how-our-brain-ages/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt; Norwegian Sci Tech News&lt;/a&gt;: "Today's recommendations emphasise total activity, but we show that even small amounts of high intensity exercise have an effect on the brain... Exercise is cheap, accessible and has no side effects. It should be considered a first-line measure to preserve brain health."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dementia encompasses several conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, that result in a progressive decline in brain function. According to &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; figures, more than 944,000 people in the UK suffer from dementia, with one in every 11 over 65s affected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31595415" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Although there is currently no cure for dementia, available treatments can help alleviate symptoms like confusion, memory loss, and speech difficulties. Yet, recent studies have also indicated that simple lifestyle changes could prevent up to 45% of dementia cases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2024-03-27-risk-factors-faster-aging-brain-revealed-new-study#:~:text=Importantly%2C%20as%20Professor%20Anderson%20Winkler,them%20together%20to%20assess%20the" target="_self" rel="nofollow"&gt;Oxford University&lt;/a&gt; found that lacking physical activity, alcohol, and pollution exposure were among the factors that could exacerbate dementia risk after assessing 40,000 brain scans. Furthermore, Dr Valter Longo, who directs the Longevity Institute at the University of Southern California, has also emphasised the importance of fitness and brisk walking in long-term health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://valterlongo.com/exercise-and-longevity/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;previous blog&lt;/a&gt;, he stressed that strolling for just one hour per day could suffice. "Walk fast for an hour every day," Dr Longo said. On the weekend, walk everywhere, even faraway places (avoid polluted areas as much as possible)."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The NHS defines a brisk walk as moving at around three mph. If you're unsure of your walking speed, the health service suggests downloading the free Active 10 app on your smartphone, which can provide tips to increase your pace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It further advises: If you're not very active but are able to walk, increase your walking distance gradually. If your joints are a problem, check whether your local swimming pool holds exercise classes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The water helps to support your joints while you move and can help you strengthen your muscles."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Have you got a story to share?
