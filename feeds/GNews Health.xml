While not the whole story, it may help explain why we see almost twice as many cases of dementia in women than in men."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The brain changes occurred in:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;a area which has a major role in learning and memory - the hippocampus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;a region essential for forming memories and spatial navigation - the entorhinal cortex&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;a part which helps with attention and regulating emotions - the anterior cingulate cortex&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;White matter and grey matter are both essential parts of the brain and spinal cord. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Grey matter consists of neuronal cell bodies and their dendrites - short protrusions that communicate with neurons nearby. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;White matter consists of long axons of neurons that transmit impulses to more distant regions of the brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Asking for help &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;According to guidelines for the NHS, HRT can be considered for menopausal symptoms such as sleep problems and hot flushes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;There is limited understanding of the effects of menopause and HRT use on the brain, memory and mood, say the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The study found women on HRT were more likely to suffer poor mental health. But may of those already had poorer mental health before being prescribed the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Co-researcher Dr Christelle Langley said it was important to recognise the variety of struggles that can come with menopause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We all need to be more sensitive to not only the physical, but also the mental health of women during menopause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"There should be no embarrassment in letting others know what you're going through and asking for help."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Michelle Dyson from the Alzheimer's Society said women account for around two-thirds of people living with Alzheimer's disease in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"And while we still don't fully understand why they are more susceptible than men, it is thought that hormones may play a role," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"This large study adds to evidence showing how menopause impacts the brain, including physical changes such as loss of brain volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"But without long-term participant tracking, to check if they later develop dementia, we cannot be sure that these brain changes associated with menopause also increase dementia risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She said getting regular exercise, not smoking and limiting alcohol intake can help cut the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:04:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE14eERsaTEwUkVxcFh0Ni1VNU5JbHUzQ0dxQXpQNVhvMnJfSW8zTTZGMmhIbU1NbkVHbXhiVVlRQk5GTmFoTXNidkNDSllrb3JQZUVMXzJaT0Q1UQ</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，数十个CDC数据库尚未更新—大多数与疫苗有关- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-databases-not-updated-vaccines-study-rcna255467</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-029a28" class="body-graf"&gt;Nearly half of the databases that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention used to update regularly — surveillance systems that tracked public health information like Covid vaccination rates and hospitalizations for respiratory syncytial virus — have been paused without explanation, according to new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-be0222" class="body-graf"&gt;The findings, &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-04022" target="_blank"&gt;published Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, indicate that at the start of 2025, the CDC maintained 82 databases that were updated at least monthly. But by the end of October, the study found, 38 had gone stale, with 34 showing no new entries at all in the previous six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-43efd1" class="body-graf"&gt;“These unexplained pauses started predominantly in March and April 2025, shortly after Mr. Trump assumed the presidency and Mr. Kennedy was confirmed as Secretary of Health and Human Services,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-76ec03" class="body-graf"&gt;Although the CDC is perhaps best known for issuing public health advisories and recommendations, the agency also plays a key role as a national record-keeper, tracking the spread of infections and uptake of vaccines in as close to real time as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e4be76" class="body-graf"&gt;But the CDC appears to be backing away from that part of its work, the new research suggests. The study found that nearly 90% of the paused databases were related to vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-67da31" class="body-graf"&gt;As examples, study author Dr. Jeremy Jacobs, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University, pointed to one database that monitored weekly Covid vaccinations among pregnant women and another that tracked Covid vaccinations among all U.S. adults (with breakdowns based on demographics and geographical region). Both were last updated in late April, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d65493" class="body-graf"&gt;Other out-of-date databases looked at respiratory illnesses treated in emergency departments and the use of an injectable drug that can protect infants from RSV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-341565" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s curious that all these changes are primarily, and almost exclusively, in the area of vaccination,” said Noel Brewer, another study author and a professor of public health at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7e434c" class="body-graf"&gt;“On the face of this, this all looks fairly deliberate, but we don’t really know why these websites went silent,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-90c721" class="body-graf"&gt;Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Health and Human Services Department, said the CDC reports Covid and RSV activity through its respiratory virus surveillance systems and reports weekly flu activity through a database called FluView.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9b3a85" class="body-graf"&gt;“Changes to individual dashboards or update schedules reflect routine data quality and system management decisions, not political direction,” Nixon said in a statement. “Under this administration, public health data reporting is driven by scientific integrity, transparency, and accuracy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d1feb1" class="body-graf"&gt;Without current information from these databases, several public health experts said, it is more difficult to know what vaccination coverage looks like on the national or regional level — which, consequently, can make it harder to deal with new outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ec70f8" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Lisa Lee, senior associate vice president for research and innovation at Virginia Tech, spent 14 years at the CDC, including as chief science officer in the agency’s office of surveillance and epidemiology. She said local health officials often rely on CDC databases to guide their responses to public health crises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a3c48f" class="body-graf"&gt;“If we, for example, see wild-type polio again in our country because we have reduced uptake of vaccine, that is the surveillance system that’s telling us this information,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0f83f6" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, chief executive officer of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-05527" target="_blank"&gt;an editorial&lt;/a&gt; also published Monday in Annals of Internal Medicine that the lapse in updates — whether intentional or not — demonstrates “a profound disregard for human life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ce49c4" class="body-graf"&gt;“The evidence is damning: The administration’s antivaccine stance has interrupted the reliable flow of the data we need to keep Americans safe from preventable infections,” she said. Marrazzo served as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases until September, when Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired her. She is suing Kennedy and other Trump administration officials, alleging she was let go in part because of her strong defense of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-75f101" class="body-graf"&gt;In the new study, the authors — a team of public health and medical experts and one law professor — suggest that the CDC may have stopped updating the databases due to reductions in its workforce, budget cuts or shifting attitudes about vaccines among federal health officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2dd37b" class="body-graf"&gt;Their findings reflect a larger trend of changes to the CDC’s website, some involving unreliable information that contradicts scientific consensus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-32e6b9" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is especially concerning, given the broader context. There’s misinformation about vaccines and vaccine safety being disseminated through official channels at HHS by non-health professionals,” Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1431de" class="body-graf"&gt;In November, a web page that once unequivocally stated that vaccines do not cause autism was &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-autism-vaccines-webpage-studies-changes-language-rcna244936" target="_blank"&gt;rewritten to say&lt;/a&gt; that “studies have not ruled out the possibility.” The message flew in the face of decades of scientific research that has found no link between autism and vaccines. Prior to that, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/federal-websites-temporarily-go-dark-order-comply-trump-dei-directive-rcna190244" target="_blank"&gt;removed language&lt;/a&gt; pertaining to gender identity and diversity, equity, inclusion, including &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-dei-hiv-cdc-website-removed-lgbtq-rcna190068" target="_blank"&gt;information on HIV&lt;/a&gt; and contraception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1d588c" class="body-graf"&gt;The website changes are part of a broader overhaul of the country’s public health agencies under Kennedy’s leadership. In the year since he became health secretary, the U.S. has &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/covid-vaccine-kids-pregnant-women-cdc-recommendation-rfk-jr-rcna207312" target="_blank"&gt;stopped recommending routine Covid shots for healthy kids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-cuts-500-million-mrna-vaccine-contracts-dealing-major-blow-prom-rcna223281" target="_blank"&gt;slashed funding for mRNA vaccine research&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-vaccines-overhaul-kids-denmark-fewer-childhood-shots-rcna250055" target="_blank"&gt;overhauled the childhood vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt; to include fewer universal recommendations. Kennedy also fired the CDC’s previous committee of vaccine advisers and replaced them with a group that has largely expressed skepticism of the shots. In December, the new panel &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-stops-recommending-hepatitis-b-vaccines-newborns-rcna248035" target="_blank"&gt;rolled back a decadeslong recommendation&lt;/a&gt; to vaccinate all newborns against hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1755f9" class="body-graf"&gt;“It pains me to say that you need to really look at some of these recommendations with caution,” Marrazzo said. “If I were a parent, I would trust my board-certified pediatrician, who hopefully is a member of, or aligned with, the American Academy of Pediatrics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eb06f3" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;The academy on Monday released its own &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/15585/?autologincheck=redirected&amp;amp;_gl=1*182sr3a*_ga*MTAwMjU1Mzg4Ni4xNzY5NDYzNTg2*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*czE3Njk0NjM1ODYkbzEkZzAkdDE3Njk0NjM1ODYkajYwJGwwJGgw*_gcl_au*NzYwMTAxMDI5LjE3Njk0NjM1ODU.*_ga_GMZCQS1K47*czE3Njk0NjM1ODYkbzEkZzAkdDE3Njk0NjM1ODYkajYwJGwwJGgw" target="_blank"&gt;guidance for childhood vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, which is similar to the schedule the CDC recommended before Kennedy announced sweeping changes earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 22:41:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxNX25pZVVmbTJqeGNoNGRWeE1FWU5QOFBoMktVZ05BWUNDVDBHY0pXa0hELVViSDZPdE16NTBuSUJac1pkTEVxdzlpcnJkcVhqM3puNEdMcnpxYS1nbFRDamhtU1BuejltZWtRXy1TVW5IYW9RcWRIbEJKNVhiSm84T3FhRXpDRTktNXZpUVFEOU0xTFVKZWVfeTF3</guid></item><item><title>作为RFK Jr.的首要疫苗顾问，医生的面部手掌问题需要注射脊髓灰质炎疫苗- Ars Technica</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/do-we-really-need-polio-shots-deep-thoughts-by-rfk-jr-advisor-get-dragged/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;He then pondered out loud what would happen if people stopped getting vaccinated. “If we take away all of the herd immunity, then does that switch, does that teeter-totter switch in a different direction?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Backlash&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, AMA Trustee Sandra Adamson Fryhofer blasted the question. “This is not a theoretical debate—it is a dangerous step backward,” she said. “Vaccines have saved millions of lives and virtually eliminated devastating diseases like polio in the United States. There is no cure for polio. When vaccination rates fall, paralysis, lifelong disability, and death return. The science on this is settled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fryhofer also took aim at Milhoan’s repeated argument that the focus of vaccination policy should move from population-level health to individual autonomy. Moving away from routine immunizations, which include discussions between clinicians and patients, “does not increase freedom—it increases suffering,” she said, adding that the weakening of recommendations “will cost lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Milhoan’s comments only further erode the relevance of ACIP and federal vaccine policy among the medical community and states. According to &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/state-health-policy-data/state-recommendations-for-routine-childhood-vaccines-increasing-departure-from-federal-guidelines/"&gt;a KFF policy brief&lt;/a&gt;, 27 states and Washington, DC, have already announced they will not follow current CDC vaccine recommendations, which &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/under-anti-vaccine-rfk-jr-cdc-slashes-childhood-vaccine-schedule/"&gt;Kennedy dramatically overhauled&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month without even consulting the ACIP. Instead, the majority of states are relying on previous recommendations or recommendations made within states or by medical organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the American Academy of Pediatrics &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2025/american-academy-of-pediatric-issues-recommended-childhood-and-adolescent-immunization-schedule-for-2026/"&gt;announced the 2026 update&lt;/a&gt; to its &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-075754/206175/Recommended-Childhood-and-Adolescent-Immunization?autologincheck=redirected"&gt;childhood and adolescent vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt;, which it has held up as an alternative to the CDC’s schedule and has been widely embraced by pediatricians. In the announcement, AAP noted that 12 other medical organizations have endorsed the schedule, including the AMA, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AAP’s updated recommendations are largely the same as the schedule from last year, but it is significantly different from the CDC’s recommendations, which “depart from longstanding medical evidence and no longer offer the optimal way to prevent illnesses in children,” the AAP said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The AAP will continue to provide recommendations for immunizations that are rooted in science and are in the best interest of the health of infants, children and adolescents of this country,” AAP President Andrew Racine said in the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The enemy of our enemy could very well become our friend. Scientists have possibly uncovered a new approach to treating Alzheimer’s disease—one tied to the development of cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China studied mice given human cancers. These mice were protected from Alzheimer’s, they found, likely due to a protein produced by tumor cells known as cystatin-C, or cyst-C. The research could lead to novel treatments for the currently incurable form of dementia, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These findings provide significant conceptual advances into cancer neuroscience and establish therapeutic avenues that are distinct from present amyloid-lowering strategies, the authors wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)01433-3"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this month in the journal Cell.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A strange heated rivalry&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;With their work, the team was hoping to unravel a peculiar phenomenon &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/nov/16/are-cancer-survivors-less-likely-to-develop-alzheimers"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; by past studies: People diagnosed with cancer are less likely to later develop Alzheimer’s. Even stranger, this pattern goes &lt;a href="https://www.musc.edu/content-hub/News/2025/10/01/Alzheimer-protein-holds-clues-for-fighting-cancer"&gt;both ways&lt;/a&gt;, since people with Alzheimer’s also seem less likely to catch cancer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They experimented with mice predisposed to develop Alzheimer’s. They gave the mice (via transplantation) various cancers taken from people: lung, colon, and prostate cancer. Compared to the control group, the cancer-bearing mice didn’t develop a high level of amyloid plaques in their brains, a key biomarker of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers then went looking for a specific cause behind this protection. They ultimately found the tumor cells in these mice were producing noticeable amounts of cyst-C, and that the protein was able to travel through the bloodstream, bypass the blood-brain barrier, and reach the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In subsequent mice experiments, they found evidence that cyst-C could bind to amyloid oligomers, the toxic clumps of amyloid that are a precursor to plaques. The cyst-C also seemed to activate microglia, the specialized immune cells of the brain, via a receptor called TREM2. Furthermore, it appeared that these activated microglia were better at clearing out amyloid plaques.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And when they gave their Alzheimer’s mice added amounts of cyst-C, the mice became better at solving mazes, indicating their cognition and memory had improved.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;What does it all mean?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This research, impressive as it is, is still in its early days. More studies will be needed to know whether cyst-C’s effects against Alzheimer’s can actually be seen in people as opposed to mice, for instance. Even if this work does bear fruit, no one’s suggesting that we should try to get cancer as a way to avoid Alzheimer’s down the road.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That said, the findings certainly do provide more places for scientists to start looking for the next Alzheimer’s treatment, whether it’s in cyst-C, TREM2 activation, or other compounds produced by cancer cells. That’s more help we urgently need. It’s &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12040760/"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; at least 7 million Americans currently have Alzheimer’s, a number that could nearly double within the next few decades. And even the best medications today only modestly slow the progression of the disease, which is still currently 100% fatal.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;Situation at a glance&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p class="don-content"&gt;
            On 26 January 2026, the Ministry of Health of Ethiopia declared the end of the Marburg virus disease (MVD) outbreak. This declaration came after two consecutive incubation periods (a total of 42 days) since the last person confirmed with MVD died and was given a safe and dignified burial, in accordance with WHO recommendations on 14 December 2025. As of 25 January 2026, a cumulative total of 19 cases, including 14 confirmed (including nine deaths) and five probable cases (all deaths), were reported. 
A total of 857 contacts listed for monitoring all had completed their 21-day follow-up as of 25 January 2026.

WHO, through its country office and partners, provided technical, operational and financial support to the government to contain this outbreak. 
        &lt;/p&gt;


        &lt;p class="don-images d-block d-lg-none"&gt;

        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;Description of the situation&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;On 14 November 2025, after the laboratory confirmation of suspected viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) cases in Jinka town, South Ethiopia Regional State, Ethiopia, the Ministry of Health of Ethiopia declared an outbreak of Marburg Virus Disease (MVD). Molecular testing conducted by the National Reference Laboratory at the Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI) identified Marburg virus (MARV) in patient samples. This was the first time Ethiopia was reporting a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON585" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;MVD outbreak&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first known case was an adult from Jinka town who developed symptoms on 23 October. The patient presented to the General Hospital the following day with vomiting, loss of appetite, and abdominal cramps. As of 25 January 2026, a cumulative total of 14 confirmed cases, including nine deaths (Case Fatality Rate (CFR) 64.3%) and five probable cases, all of whom had died, were reported by the Ministry of Health from Jinka, Malle and Dasench woredas in South Ethiopia Region and Hawassa in Sidama Region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 25 January 2026, a total of 857 contacts were listed who completed 21 days of follow-up, 760 from the South Ethiopia Region and 97 from the Sidama Region. As of 5 January 2026, 3800 samples were tested for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 26 January 2026, after two consecutive incubation periods (a total of 42 days), without a new confirmed case reported, after the last confirmed case died and was given a safe and dignified burial, on 14 December 2025, the Ministry of Health of Ethiopia declared the end of the MVD outbreak, as per WHO recommendations.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Map of districts reporting confirmed and probable Marburg virus disease cases in Ethiopia, as of 25 January 2026&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sf-image-responsive="true" src="https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/products/disease-outbreak-news/map-for-marburg-virus-disease-in-ethiopia.png?sfvrsn=15b744e9_3" title="Map for Marburg virus disease in Ethiopia" alt="Map for Marburg virus disease in Ethiopia" sf-size="118205"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;p class="don-images d-block d-lg-none"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;Epidemiology&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Marburg virus disease (MVD) is a severe disease caused by either of two closely related viruses, Marburg virus and Ravn virus.  MVD has a high case fatality rate, ranging from 24% to 88% from previous outbreaks. The CFR can be lowered with early supportive patient care. The virus is initially transmitted to humans from fruit bats (&lt;em&gt;Rousettus aegyptiacus&lt;/em&gt;) and then spreads among people through direct contact with bodily fluids, contaminated surfaces, or infected materials. Healthcare workers, caregivers, and individuals involved in burial practices are particularly at risk when appropriate infection, prevention and control measures are not in place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MVD symptoms typically begin abruptly after an incubation period of two to 21 days and include high fever, severe headache, malaise, muscle aches, and progressive gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting. In severe cases, patients may experience bleeding from multiple sites and die from shock and organ failure within a week of symptom onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no approved treatment or vaccines for MVD, although early supportive care improves survival. Some candidate vaccines and therapeutics are currently under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nineteen outbreaks of MVD have previously been reported globally. The most &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON552" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; outbreak was reported from the Republic of Tanzania between January and March 2025. Additional countries that have reported outbreaks of MVD in the African Region include Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa, and Uganda. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;p class="don-images d-block d-lg-none"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;Public health response&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Local and national health authorities in Ethiopia implemented the following public health measures:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A National Taskforce established at the Ministry of Health to provide strategic guidance, make decisions and mobilize resources. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A costed national three-month response plan developed and launched by the MoH/EPHI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The MoH regularly disseminated information on the MVD outbreak to the public and key partners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Public Health Emergency Operational Centres were activated at national and regional levels, with incident management structures established to coordinate the response. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Ministry of Health, in collaboration with EPHI and regional health offices, conducted integrated surveillance and response activities, including at priority points of entry (PoEs) and points of control (PoCs). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Community surveillance, contact tracing, house-to-house visits, and medical service delivery were enhanced. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two hospitals designated as treatment centres, with dedicated health workers deployed to manage cases. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Laboratory capacities were strengthened both at national level and through the deployment of a mobile laboratory in Jinka for timely confirmation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Field assessments conducted by a rapid response team (RRT). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) teams disseminated MVD prevention messages, conducted community dialogues, developed activity plans for targeted community interventions, monitored social media to address misinformation, and assessed trusted communication channels to enhance public awareness and engage local networks and influencers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO, through its country office and partners, provided technical, operational and financial support to the government to contain this outbreak. These include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;WHO provided policy, technical and operational support across all response pillars, including on PoE surveillance, laboratory, case management, IPC, safe and dignified burial, RCCE, logistics and cross-border coordination. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provided emergency supplies including testing kits, VHF kits, treatment centre modules. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deployed technical experts to provide operational support across all response pillars. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provided technical support for capacity building and supervision on surveillance, integrated case management and IPC activities. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Continued providing technical and strategic support for the transition plan, including the integration of the MVD response into essential health services. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Supported the Regional Health Bureau (RHB) with community-based active case searching and mortality surveillance across various clusters. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provided technical and programmatic support to the RHB for the development and implementation of the Survivors Program. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;p class="don-images d-block d-lg-none"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;WHO risk assessment&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This was the first-ever confirmed MVD outbreak reported in Ethiopia.  Based on the outbreak investigation and surveillance activities during the response, which included contact tracing, alert management, active case search, and mortality surveillance, no additional cases have been reported during the 42-day countdown period, as per WHO recommendations. However, there remains a risk of re-emergence of MVD following the declaration of the end of the outbreak, with potential spillovers from interactions with the animal reservoir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk communication and community engagement activities will continue to provide timely and accurate information, monitor and address community feedback and rumours, while supporting efforts to reduce stigma toward individuals affected by the outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;p class="don-images d-block d-lg-none"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;WHO advice&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;WHO encourages maintaining early detection and care capacities in addition to sustaining the ability to quickly respond after the outbreak ends. This is to make sure that if the disease re-emerges, health authorities can detect it immediately, prevent the disease from spreading again, and ultimately save lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raising awareness of risk factors for MVD and protective measures that individuals can take is an effective way to reduce human transmission. WHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce MVD transmission in healthcare facilities and in communities:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Reducing the risk      of bat-to-human transmission arising from prolonged exposure to mines or      caves inhabited by fruit bat colonies. People visiting or working in mines      or caves inhabited by fruit bat colonies should wear gloves and other      appropriate protective clothing (including masks).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Capabilities for      early detection of MVD patients should be maintained over time in settings      at risk of the disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Reducing the risk      of human-to-human transmission in the community arising from direct or      close contact with infected patients, particularly with their body fluids.      Close physical contact with MVD patients should be avoided. Patients      suspected or confirmed for MVD should be isolated in a designated      treatment centre for early care and to avoid transmission at home.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Communities affected by MVD, along with health authorities, should ensure that the      population is well informed, both about the nature of the disease itself      and about necessary outbreak containment measures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Outbreak containment measures include safe and dignified burial of the deceased,      identifying people who may have been in contact with someone infected with      MVD and monitoring their health for 21 days and providing care to the      confirmed patient. Any sick people with symptoms matching MVD should be      referred to a health facility with adequate capacity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Critical infection      prevention and control measures should be implemented and/or strengthened      in all health care facilities, per &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-WPE-CRS-HCR-2023.1" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;WHO’s Infection prevention and control guideline      for Ebola and Marburg disease&lt;/a&gt;. Health workers caring for patients with confirmed or      suspected MVD should apply &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-UHL-IHS-IPC-2022.2" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;transmission-based precautions&lt;/a&gt; in addition to: &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-UHL-IHS-IPC-2022.1" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;standard precautions&lt;/a&gt;, including appropriate use of PPE and hand      hygiene according to the &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/integrated-health-services-(ihs)/infection-prevention-and-control/your-5-moments-for-hand-hygiene-poster.pdf?sfvrsn=83e2fb0e_21" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;WHO 5 moments&lt;/a&gt; to avoid contact with patient’s blood and      other body fluids and with contaminated surfaces and objects. Waste      generated in healthcare facilities must be safely segregated, collected,      transported, stored, treated and finally disposed. Follow the national      guidelines, rules and regulations for safe waste disposal or follow      the &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/85349/9789241548564_eng.pdf;sequence=1" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;WHO’s guidelines on safe waste management&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Patient-care activities should be undertaken in a clean and hygienic environment that      facilitates practices related to the prevention and control of      health-care-associated infections (HAIs) as outlined in &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241547239" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Essential environmental health standards in      health care&lt;/a&gt;. Safe water,      adequate sanitation and hygiene infrastructure and services should be      provided in healthcare facilities.

Those scenes shaped her view so much that she didn’t even realize many of her own symptoms – from &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2026/01/19/menopause-symptom-dry-eyes-naomi-watts/88162850007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;dry eyes&lt;/a&gt; to frozen shoulder – were signs that she was nearing menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Now at 57, Watts wants to change this narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Podcasters, &lt;a href="/story/entertainment/books/2026/01/12/melani-sanders-we-do-not-care-club-menopause-book/87705311007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;creators&lt;/a&gt;, comedians and writers are taking menopause conversations from taboo to mainstream. And Hollywood producers need to follow, Watts says. She is pushing for more stories that redefine midlife as a time of power, not decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“We need to see ourselves represented,” she tells USA TODAY. “Talking about menopause and showing our stories in movies can help women feel less alone.

She was shocked. After a struggle to get pregnant and a miscarriage, Watts went on to have two children one year apart. Then her menopause symptoms began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It was a lonely, scary time,” she remembers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Growing up in a time when there were two roles for women – romantic lead and grandma – Watts kept her menopause to herself. She worried that talking about it publicly would end her career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It took her more than 10 years to tell her menopause stories, becoming one of the first celebrities to do so widely. Many followed, from Drew Barrymore who shared that she was having a hot flash during an interview on her talk show in 2023 to &lt;a href="/story/entertainment/celebrities/2024/05/03/halle-berry-menopause-bill/73560451007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Halle Berry&lt;/a&gt; who joined U.S. senators at the Capitol last year to push for more money for menopause research and education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Watts cofounded Stripes, a menopause beauty and wellness brand, in 2022. The company sells everything from vitamins to vaginal cream. Her book, &lt;a href="/booklist/books/dare-i-say-it-everything-i-wish-id-known-about-menopause/9780593729038/2025-01-29" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;“Dare I Say It: Everything I Wish I Knew About Menopause,”&lt;/a&gt; which combined funny and relatable stories with expert advice, was published in 2025. (The book comes out in paperback in February.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I don’t want to be told it’s time to stop,” she says. “I have plenty more to say and do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Will menopause have its movie moment?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Has there been a movie in the past decade featuring a menopause story line?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Watts says it’s hard to think of one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;OK, how about TV?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There’s &lt;a href="/story/entertainment/tv/2025/07/31/leanne-morgan-netflix-tv-show/85191875007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;“Leeanne,”&lt;/a&gt; the sitcom from comedian Leeanne Morgan.

And we need to do better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;About 8 in 10 adults 18 and older say movies and TV shape how people see aging, according to a recent study from &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=83224X1595658&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aarp.org%2Fpri%2Ftopics%2Fsocial-leisure%2Factivities-interests%2Fage-diversity-movies-television%2F%3FCMP%3DRDRCT-PRI-ENT&amp;amp;xcust=USAT&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fentertainment%2Fmovies%2F2026%2F01%2F26%2Fnaomi-watts-menopause-movies%2F88162092007%2F" data-v-afl data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;AARP&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;WAUKESHA, Wis. — The &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/"&gt;Wisconsin Department of Health Services&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/news/releases/012626.htm"&gt;confirms the first case of measles&lt;/a&gt; in the Badger state this year in a resident in Waukesha County.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health officials at the state level and from the &lt;a href="https://www.waukeshacounty.gov/health-and-human-services/"&gt;Waukesha County Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; report the case is related to an adult traveling internationally, and are still working to identify and notify anyone who may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So far, they have not identified any locations where the general public may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, measles&lt;/a&gt; is a highly contagious disease that can spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and can linger in the air for up to two hours after the exposure. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is so contagious that if one person gets it, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/causes/index.html"&gt;up to 90% of the people around them may also become infected if they are not vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles typically appear approximately 10 to 21 days after an exposure, and include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Runny nose.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;High fever (may be greater than 104°F).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Tiredness.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Cough.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes, or conjunctivitis (“pink eye”).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A red rash with raised bumps that starts at the hairline and moves to the arms and legs three to five days after symptoms begin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Measles can cause serious health complications, including pneumonia, brain damage, and deafness, and can sometimes become deadly. One in four people who get measles in the United States will be hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health officials say the best prevention for measles is two doses of the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine (MMR), which is 97% effective at preventing the disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wisconsin residents can check if they are vaccinated through the Wisconsin Immunization &lt;a href="https://www.dhfswir.org/PR/logoff.do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Registry&lt;/a&gt; or contact their health care provider or local health department to see if they or their child has been vaccinated to protect against measles.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This brain drain appears to be real. I spoke to Jared Kaplan, co-founder of Anthropic, the company behind the chatbot Claude. He was a physicist the last time we spoke. As a grad student at Harvard in the 2000s, he worked with the renowned theorist Nima Arkani-Hamed to open up the new directions in amplitude research that are being actively pursued today. But Kaplan left the field in 2019. “I started working on AI because it seemed plausible to me that … AI was going to make progress faster than almost any field in science historically,” he said. AI would be “the most important thing to happen while we’re alive, maybe one of the most important things to happen in the history of science. And so it seemed obvious that I should work on it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the future of particle physics, AI makes worrying about it now rather pointless, in Kaplan’s view. “I think that it’s kind of irrelevant what we plan on a 10-year timescale, because if we’re building a collider in 10 years, AI will be building the collider; humans won’t be building it. I would give like a 50% chance that in two or three years, theoretical physicists will mostly be replaced with AI. Brilliant people like Nima Arkani-Hamed or Ed Witten, AI will be generating papers that are as good as their papers pretty autonomously. … So planning beyond this couple-year timescale isn’t really something I think about very much.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cari Cesarotti, a postdoctoral fellow in the theory group at CERN, is skeptical about that future. She notices chatbots’ mistakes, and how they’ve become too much of a crutch for physics students. “AI is making people worse at physics,” she said. “What we need is humans to read textbooks and sit down and think of new solutions to the hierarchy problem.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cesarotti was a high school junior when the Higgs boson was discovered. She grew up near Fermilab, the U.S. national lab in Illinois that houses the Tevatron, which was the world’s highest-energy particle collider before the LHC. (The top quark was discovered there in 1995.) This proximity taught her that a particle physicist was a thing you could be. Later, it turned out to be &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; thing. “What are the fundamental building blocks of the universe — those were the questions that I was most interested in knowing the answer to,” she told me. “But what people said was, ‘Particle physics is dead. Don’t do this.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may have been a fair warning; Cesarotti has yet to land a permanent job as a rising particle physicist. The subfield has continued to shrink, she and others said, as faculty hiring committees and grad students go in other directions. “Definitely all this rhetoric that there was nothing to be found and you should give up on it — people listened,” she said. “And of course that means there are fewer people. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you’re pushing all these talented people out of trying to solve these problems into a field that it’s easier to make an impact on, then you’re setting yourself up for failure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cesarotti echoed a sentiment I’d heard from others, which sounds correct to me as well: “Particle physics isn’t dead; it’s just hard.” It’s hard to know what to think about or look for. But the most devoted particle physicists are thinking and looking all the same.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        
&lt;p&gt;“It was easy for 125 years,” Strassler said. “One thing led to the next. That lucky century has, for now, at least in the medium term, come to an end. That could change tomorrow, or next century, or who knows.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hint of a new lightweight particle could, in theory, show up at the LHC, or in some other experiment. Strassler is particularly excited about the study of &lt;a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-first-nuclear-clock-will-test-if-fundamental-constants-change-20240904/"&gt;radioactive thorium-229 decay&lt;/a&gt;, which could reveal variations in the fundamental constants. I’m slightly partial to &lt;a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/he-seeks-mystery-magnetic-fields-with-his-quantum-compass-20240517/"&gt;experiments looking for “axions,”&lt;/a&gt; dark matter candidates that are so lightweight that they can act a little like light itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the theory side, an obvious solution to the hierarchy problem could drop naturally out of the geometry behind scattering amplitudes. Or, if Kaplan is right, AI systems might someday suggest powerful new ideas for how the 25 particles of the Standard Model fit into a more comprehensive pattern — a possibility I didn’t foresee back when the crisis began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, further progress toward the truth remains possible in particle physics. But there’s no discovery guarantee. I’ve had more than 13 years to think about it, and it remains a disturbing prospect: All the empirical clues we can glean about nature’s fundamental laws and building blocks might already be in hand. The universe may plan on keeping the rest of its secrets.&lt;/p&gt;

A new study adds more to the evidence: Scientists discovered that even light physical activity, such as walking or house chores, has the power to “significantly” lower heart disease, diabetes, and mortality risk in people with cardiovascular kidney metabolic syndrome (CKM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the Experts: &lt;a href="https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/doctors/thachil-rosy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rosy Thachil, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Rosy Thachil, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, cardiologist at NYC Health + Hospitals in Elmhurst; &lt;a href="https://medicine.iu.edu/faculty/61331/breathett-khadijah" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Khadijah Breathett, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Khadijah Breathett, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of the Krannert Cardiovascular Research Center at the Indiana University School of Medicine; and &lt;a href="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/dr-randy-gould/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Randy Gould, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Randy Gould, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a doctor with Manhattan Cardiology and &lt;a href="https://www.labfinder.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:LabFinder;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;LabFinder&lt;/a&gt; contributor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CKM is a term used to describe the interconnection between cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and chronic kidney disease, according to the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39705194/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; (NIH). An estimated 25% of participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which spanned from 1990 to 2020, had at least one CKM condition. CKM is thought to be linked to excess or dysfunctional adipose tissue (fat), which leads to inflammation that may cause organ tissue damage and insulin resistance, leading to heart trouble, type 2 diabetes, and related issues. CKM syndrome is classified into four stages based on clinical signs and risk factors that include chronic inflammation, family history of diabetes or kidney disease, mental health and sleep disorders, and others, per the NIH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.125.046271" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of the American Heart Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, researchers analyzed the health data of more than 7,200 people over 20 with CKM of various stages between 2003 and 2006. The sample group wore accelerometers (activity trackers) to record their daily movement and its intensity. Approximately 14 years after the exercise data were recorded, researchers followed up on participants’ health and noted the severity of CKM. Overall, they found light physical activity to be increasingly linked to a longer life among patients with advancing stages of the condition. They also found that increasing light activity by an hour every day was linked to about a 14% to 20% lower risk of dying early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Light movement can replace sedentary time, improve circulation, support glucose handling, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a65912601/ways-to-lower-blood-pressure-naturally/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lower blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, and reduce &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a38595773/what-is-insulin-resistance-syndrome/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insulin resistance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;—small physiologic wins that add up when repeated daily, especially in advanced disease,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/doctors/thachil-rosy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rosy Thachil, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Rosy Thachil, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, cardiologist at NYC Health + Hospitals in Elmhurst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though it’s important to note the limitations of the study. This was not a clinical trial; patients were not randomized to different levels of exercise, and some had more ability than others. “Behaviorally motivated patients may have been more likely to participate, and less sick patients may have been more likely to participate,” says &lt;a href="https://medicine.iu.edu/faculty/61331/breathett-khadijah" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Khadijah Breathett, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Khadijah Breathett, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of the Krannert Cardiovascular Research Center at the Indiana University School of Medicine. “This influences the findings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the participants studied were already diagnosed with CKM, most of their active time was light and became the “main lever,” as Dr. Thachil calls it, in maintaining or improving health. “Also, the more advanced the disease, the greater the benefit: Moving from 90 minutes a day to two hours a day of light physical activity was associated with a larger absolute risk reduction in stage 4 of CKM versus stage 2,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is considered light activity?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Light exercise is easy to do. It includes walking and being able to have a full conversation without shortness of breath,” says Dr. Breathett. “This is the exercise that you may not consider as exercise, as your heart rate typically does not rise much. It also includes some activities of daily living, such as light housework.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other examples include casual walking, yoga, stretching, and gardening, adds Dr. Thachil. “Light exercise improves heart health and metabolism. It helps lower insulin and fat levels as well as blood sugar,” says &lt;a href="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/dr-randy-gould/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Randy Gould, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Randy Gould, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a doctor with Manhattan Cardiology and &lt;a href="https://www.labfinder.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:LabFinder;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;LabFinder&lt;/a&gt; contributor. Light activity can also increase a process known as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537040/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lipoprotein lipase;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lipoprotein lipase&lt;/a&gt; activity, which improves how the body processes fats, Dr. Gould adds. “It matters because many people [with CKM] are not able to perform high-intensity activities, such as running or high-intensity cardio workouts,” he concludes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to lightly exercise for cardio-metabolic health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overarching goal is to be less sedentary—every minute and hour counts. “Start with ‘replace sitting’ goals, building towards two hours a day of light physical activity,” Dr. Thachil recommends. This can include walking breaks around the house or the neighborhood, chores, and errands on foot, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aim for 30 minutes of aerobic exercise daily,” recommends Dr. Breathett. “Start off with five minutes or 10 minutes if 30 minutes is too much. Try walking or exercising with a friend to build accountability, park farther from the entrance, take the stairs, go outside and enjoy nature, walk a block to a neighbor, walk around your superstore, join a walking club with people who have similar interests.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If feasible, keep general exercise guidelines as a goal, too, which is 150 minutes of moderate-vigorous exercise per week, says Dr. Thachil. “Frame light physical activity as a legitimate therapeutic step for people who can’t safely or realistically do moderate-vigorous physical activity yet,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to movement, the “essential eight” lifestyle factors for improving cardio-metabolic health include controlling blood pressure, glucose, and cholesterol (know your numbers), getting seven to nine hours of sleep nightly, quitting smoking, eating healthy, and achieving or maintaining an ideal weight, says Dr. Breathett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The basic rules still hold true,” says Dr. Breathett. “Exercise is important for your health. Prioritize exercise today, and you may not have to prioritize managing sickness later.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put differently: “Light activity counts,” says Dr. Thachil. “Especially if you’re high-risk.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:44:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPVVNsNlRWUEZVdGx1TmxPVkxlRkdNblZVWkNIbEJScWlUTGZPc0VES21DSWVqSzl5NXk5MkpHRFM4R0V6enFkUFJYMXIyMWtRR2V0WjNURUEyRm1YcUtIREFGRDctUUg1WGpxa0tlUUwybVJ4NkpjMmI4dEtTelhCbEVKUlhmMFlFLUczZWpuNDlaaWlDT3c</guid></item><item><title>尊敬的医生：丁香茶是否有助于抵御体内寄生虫？ - oregonlive.com</title><link>https://www.oregonlive.com/advice/2026/01/dear-doctor-is-clove-tea-helpful-in-warding-off-internal-parasites.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="542MQPQPKRABZJ45YXQCUYE2NE"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: I’ve read that millions of people have parasites and aren’t even aware of it. How do I cleanse safely? I’m hesitant to use animal medications like fenbendazole or ivermectin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7W3QL6723FDLHORVMEZT6J4EG4"&gt;I drink clove tea daily, but I don’t believe it’s sufficient because it doesn’t cross the blood-brain barrier.

The most common of these are intestinal parasites, such as Blastocystis or Strongyloides. While it may be unpleasant to think about intestinal parasites, we generally don’t recommend treatment in asymptomatic people even if it’s been diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RY3TI4KXNRAJTIMNB5QNY7PRHI"&gt;Microorganisms are categorized into three groups: beneficial ones, like the healthy bacteria that are found in our intestines by the trillions; harmful (pathogenic) ones that cause disease; and commensals, which neither help us nor hurt us much. For most people, protozoans like Blastocystis are commensals, so there is no need to treat them. There are very few instances of when an asymptomatic parasite needs to be treated, and it is quite rare among people who are born in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BFBVPPVGSJDF5AWPC4MMYJE37Q"&gt;Clove tea is a traditional herbal medicine to treat some parasites, but it is not particularly effective; I don’t recommend it as a treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZBTLYZ6IYBFDJLVZ4XVYFQPOJE"&gt;The most common symptoms of intestinal parasites are diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, gas, anal itching and weight loss. Parasites are not a common cause of these in the U.S., but persistent symptoms deserve a thorough evaluation, not home remedies and certainly not powerful antiparasitic medicine -- unless it’s been prescribed after a firm diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JD2WYVP5DRE3JNNCB7EDTECVGE"&gt;Ivermectin is used in both animals and humans for parasitic infections. Although fenbendazole is not approved for humans, similar medicines like albendazole can be used in humans in cases where a parasite is in need of treatment.

ROACH: I’m a 70-year-old woman who has suffered with vaginal dryness ever since I went through menopause. My doctor has prescribed a hormone cream, estradiol 0.01%, to help with the symptoms. The side effects and warnings are worrisome, even though my doctor assures me that it’s safe to use. I value your opinion and would appreciate your thoughts. -- K.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RR2PW57WINDYVAINB553CAUZOM"&gt;ANSWER: The Food and Drug Administration requires boxed warnings, which are the highest level of concern, on systemic estrogen such as pills. Until November 2025, the same warnings existed on topical treatments such as creams and gels. In my opinion, the risks of estrogen cream like the estradiol you have been prescribed are low. I agree with removing the boxed warning, which can scare women from using these helpful, low-risk treatments for symptoms of low estrogen, including vaginal dryness or painful sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DVZ6A74JWFBOVDY25VW5S4FOEY"&gt;As always, I do recommend that anyone who is prescribed estrogen and has a history of an estrogen-sensitive tumor (such as breast cancer) should discuss this treatment with their oncologist prior to starting it.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The types of magnesium used in studies to improve sleep include magnesium glycinate, magnesium threonate, magnesium oxide, magnesium lactate, and magnesium L-aspartate.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The body absorbs inorganic formulations of magnesium, such as magnesium oxide and magnesium sulphate, less than the organic formulations (magnesium glycinate, magnesium threonate, and magnesium taurate).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Better absorption may help improve magnesium status, which could contribute to sleep benefits in some people.

    &lt;p&gt;A baby died at three days old after NHS medics failed to wake his mother for observations while pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sonny Taylor suffered catastrophic brain damage as a result of being starved of oxygen having been left “distressed for a significant amount of time”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Midwifery staff had left his mother Eve, 29, sleeping instead of waking her for observations and to listen to Sonny’s heart, an internal &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/nhs/"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; investigation report found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The baby was then delivered in a “poor condition” via caesarean section at Ysbyty Gwynedd Hospital in Bangor, Wales. He died at three days old on Oct 3 2022 as a result of sepsis and a brain injury from oxygen starvation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His parents have won an undisclosed settlement after suing the local health board. Speaking for the first time about her son’s death, Eve said: “When I went into hospital, I never could have imagined what was to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What followed was frantic, chaotic and terrifying. I went to sleep at my emergency C-section not knowing if I would wake up or whether my baby would make it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Mother sent to wrong ward&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eve was admitted to Ysbyty Gwynedd Hospital on Sept 29, 2022 after her waters broke at 36 weeks pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sonny’s heart rate was initially diagnosed as normal, but later that afternoon signs of potential infection were identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 6pm Eve’s observations and Sonny’s heart rate and movements were classed as normal. At 10pm, as Eve was asleep, observations and monitoring were not carried out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She awoke at 1.30am on Sept 30 concerned about Sonny’s reduced movement, and a registrar was called. The registrar established that Sonny had an abnormal heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eve was wrongly transferred to the labour ward instead of being taken for delivery, arriving at 1.43am. A call for an emergency caesarean was made. There was then a 15-minute delay to Sonny’s birth, who was delivered at 2.03am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sonny was moved from a neonatal intensive care unit to palliative care, with the permission of Eve and her partner Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;NHS apologises for ‘failings’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas said that his son was “badly let down when he needed help the most”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His parents won the undisclosed settlement following legal action against the Betsi Cadwaladr University Local Health Board. Through NHS Wales, the board apologised for the “failings identified” within the investigation report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report found a midwife should have woken Eve and performed observations and listened to Sonny’s heart rate at 10pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sara Burns, a medical negligence lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, representing Eve, said: “While we’re pleased to have secured this settlement and appreciate the health board’s co-operation in resolving the case promptly, no amount of compensation can ever begin to make up for what the family has been through.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carol Shillabeer, the chief executive of Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, said: “We would like to offer our sincere sympathies to the family of baby Sonny, who sadly died in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are deeply sorry for their loss and for the failures in care that occurred. We recognise the profound impact this has had on Sonny’s family, and we apologise unreservedly for the distress caused.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eating enough protein is important for good health, Denver-area dieticians said, but people who want to increase their intake need to make sure they choose quality foods and don’t crowd out healthy carbohydrates and fats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/1720/Table_1_NIN_GEN_1720.pdf"&gt;Data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture showed&lt;/a&gt; that, as of 2020, the average American already ate enough protein to meet the new recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent edition of the federal nutrition guidelines, released in early January, raised the recommended floor for protein consumption, setting a range from 50% higher to double the previous recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-smyizmlx" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_smyizmlx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also unveiled a &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/opinion/second-opinions/119395?xid=nl_secondopinion_2026-01-13&amp;amp;mh=cb749f9dbd5470c1317620ae93c2ec2a&amp;amp;zdee=gAAAAABm4vg-k6dL2McqgKzW6iYcQLIhRsw8Z3U-v1TLMF6Gkk4jRIm37DsX8JgcEOO0hI5qoDg_sFzLHDYDJO-HDsppFII3R-n6aDnB7J9sqpot7tHDHtU%3D&amp;amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=SecondOpinions_011325"&gt;flipped food pyramid&lt;/a&gt;, with beef and full-fat dairy among the foods to emphasize at the top. Federal recommendations had ditched the pyramid about 15 years ago for a model plate divided between produce, protein and whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous protein guideline was a bare minimum to avoid malnutrition, so raising that was probably the right call, said Jessica Crandall, a registered dietitian nutritionist who works at &lt;a href="https://www.healthonecares.com/locations/rose"&gt;HCA HealthOne Rose&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, Crandall recommends 60 to 80 grams of protein each day for women and 80 to 100 grams for men. For comparison, a three-ounce serving of ground beef has 22 grams, a skinless chicken breast has 18 grams and 6 ounces of Greek yogurt has 15 to 17 grams, &lt;a href="https://weightlosssurgery.wustl.edu/app/uploads/2015/09/Protein-List.pdf"&gt;according to Washington University in St. Louis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the right amount for any individual will depend on their body weight, age, level of physical activity and health, with some conditions requiring more protein and others demanding restrictions, Crandall said.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;The International Food Information Council’s &lt;a href="https://ific.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-IFIC-Food-Health-Survey.pdf"&gt;2024 Food and Health survey&lt;/a&gt; found about 71% of Americans were specifically trying to eat protein, up from 59% in 2022. About one in five said they specifically follow a “high protein” diet, making it more popular than calorie counting, low-carb or Mediterranean food plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who work in nutrition have known about protein’s importance to the muscles and immune system for quite some time, but public perception of it has changed significantly in recent years, said Kelly Elliot, a registered dietitian nutritionist at &lt;a href="https://intermountainhealthcare.org/locations/intermountain-health-saint-joseph-hospital"&gt;Saint Joseph Hospital&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s interesting how marketing sways the public and how the public sways marketing,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While protein shakes and bars have been staples among the gym-going set for some time, other food brands are getting in on the game.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/SNICKERS-HI-PROTEIN-BAR-ORIGINAL-4CT/3988040815?"&gt;Snickers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.poptarts.com/en_US/products/all-flavors.html"&gt;Pop Tarts&lt;/a&gt; unveiled higher-protein options, and Thomas’ bagels added a line about protein content to the front of the packaging for their existing products. &lt;a href="https://protein.starbucks.com/?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=search&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ProteinLP&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=23056097230&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAADoJV5tu0lkwWdEEhsgrEiKb27k7L&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA1czLBhDhARIsAIEc7uiGpOnNlGlMlWjM_w7Iy-7TnyW7yMZqki8C33fVLfWkPj8ojiHT2jsaAl-7EALw_wcB"&gt;Starbucks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://news.dunkindonuts.com/news/dunkin-protein-milk-2026"&gt;Dunkin’ Donuts&lt;/a&gt; recently debuted drinks enhanced with whey protein, and Chipotle’s menu now promotes a “protein cup” of chicken and a chicken taco, designed to offer a similar mix of protein, fat and carbs to a protein bar, said Stephanie Perdue, Chipotle’s interim chief marketing officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve seen growing demand for protein-forward choices across more occasions, especially snack-sized portions at accessible prices,” she said in a statement. “We’ll carry this focus throughout 2026, with our culinary team driving protein-led innovation informed by customer behavior and emerging trends across our restaurants and digital channels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more people get the message that they need to increase their protein intake — despite the fact that most Americans already eat enough — food companies have responded by adding protein in unexpected places, including pretzels, chips and even bottled water, said William Hallman, a psychologist at &lt;a href="https://www.rutgers.edu/"&gt;Rutgers University&lt;/a&gt; who studies how people think about food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emphasizing protein creates a &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/13/8/1139"&gt;“health halo”&lt;/a&gt; around products that makes people think they’re a better option, even if the manufacturer had to increase sugar and fat to mask the taste of protein powder, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Consumers think it’s healthier for them, and that’s the problem,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brands highlight the positive aspects of their food, but that doesn’t mean that every high-protein product is a good choice, Elliot said. Consumers need to consider other factors such as sugar and saturated fat content, and whether the ingredients list includes a string of additives, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new nutrition guidelines also warned the public to avoid added sugars and ultra-processed foods, while maintaining the existing advice to &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/popmedicine/cultureclinic/118121?xid=nl_mpt_DHE_2025-10-23&amp;amp;mh=cb749f9dbd5470c1317620ae93c2ec2a&amp;amp;zdee=gAAAAABm4vg-k6dL2McqgKzW6iYcQLIhRsw8Z3U-v1TLMF6Gkk4jRIm37DsX8JgcEOO0hI5qoDg_sFzLHDYDJO-HDsppFII3R-n6aDnB7J9sqpot7tHDHtU%3D&amp;amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Daily%20Headlines%20Evening%20-%20Randomized%202025-10-23&amp;amp;utm_term=NL_Daily_DHE_dual-gmail-definition"&gt;limit saturated fat for heart disease prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some of these protein bars, many of them are glorified candy bars,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new nutrition guidelines may encourage products to continue jumping on the protein bandwagon, but in the long run, food companies will have to consider whether the costs of fortifying their products are worthwhile in an increasingly crowded marketplace, Hallman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“At some point, people are going to figure out they’re getting plenty of protein,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people will be able to meet their needs as long as they have a good source of protein at each meal, alongside fruits, vegetables and whole grains, Crandall said. While most people think of meat when discussing protein, other options with less saturated fat include eggs, dairy foods, seafood, nuts, seeds and beans, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Protein is one piece of the puzzle,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most people, eating more protein than they need isn’t likely to cause a problem, though it can exacerbate kidney or liver disease. The concern is that they’ll forgo foods that are low in protein but high in fiber or vitamins and minerals that also contribute to good health, Crandall said.&lt;/p&gt;

Coli&lt;/a&gt; bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on a wild virus known to infect bacteria, scientists used an AI tool called Evo2 to create 285 entirely new viruses from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While only 16 were able to attack the E. Coli, the most successful were 25 per cent quicker at killing bacteria than the wild variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, previous research has raised concerns that AI–designed pathogens could themselves become a deadly threat to humanity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists have made a major breakthrough towards creating artificial life, as they use AI to create a new virus that never existed in nature (pictured)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This incredible breakthrough comes from the work of scientists at Genyro, a startup led by British scientists and entrepreneur Dr Adrian Woolfson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Woolfson told the Daily Mail: 'For the last 4 billion years, all life on Earth has evolved by the trial-and-error process of Darwinian evolution by natural selection, which lacks any foresight or intention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Natural evolution now has a co-author. That co-author, the emerging ability of AI-driven genome design and genome construction technologies, has the potential to exist alongside natural evolution.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This has been made possible by the simultaneous development of two technologies: AI that can write genetic code, and new tools for assembling genes in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The AI tool Evo2 is much like the large language model chatbots ChatGPT and Grok, except that it has been trained on genetic codes rather than written text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Evo2 was trained on nine trillion 'base pairs' – the individual As, Cs, Ts, and Gs that are the basic materials of DNA – to teach it how genes are put together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This allows Evo2 to create entirely new codes for organisms that have never existed, specifically shaped to fit their designer's requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-mol-fe-xpmodule-join-debate='{"env":{"brand":"dailymail","channel":"sciencetech","geo":"us","platform":"mol.web.desktop","url":"/sciencetech/article-15498221/Lab-grown-LIFE-AI-virus.html?None","environment":"production","name":"mol-fe-xpmodule-join-debate-default@1","version":"1.2.0","xForwardedHost":"www.dailymail.co.uk","zkConfig":{"bundle-versions":{"default":{"bv":"18.4.1","vbv":"7.15.2","fesbv":"15.50.0","feabv":"11.48.0","abv":"10.48.0","expire-after":31536000,"tag":"fe_desktop_default"}},"bundle-versions-mobile":{"default":{"bv":"12.6.0","vbv":"7.15.2","fesbv":"15.50.0","feabv":"11.48.0","abv":"10.48.0","expire-after":31536000,"tag":"fe_mobile_default"}}}},"question":"Does the speed at which AI can design new life worry YOU?"}' data-reactroot=""&gt;&lt;div class="app--s6cJU"&gt;&lt;p class="titleContainer--BYd15"&gt;&lt;span class="titleText--LYcWe"&gt;Join the debate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="questionText--qEDdN"&gt;Does the speed at which AI can design new life worry YOU?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;This breakthrough comes from the scientists at Genyro, led by British scientist and entrepeneur Dr Adrian Woolfson.

Coli &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Right now, the virus Evo–Φ2147 is just about as complex as anything that scientists are able to create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With just 5,386 base pairs of DNA code compared to the 3.2 billion found in humans, this virus is incredibly simple and isn't even considered living by some experts since it can't reproduce on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, this is an extremely exciting moment for researchers attempting to tackle the growing threat of antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Samuel King and Dr Brian Hie, co–creators of the new virus, wrote&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://arcinstitute.org/news/hie-king-first-synthetic-phage"&gt; in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;: Bacterial resistance to antibiotics represents one of the most pressing challenges in modern medicine, with resistant infections killing hundreds of thousands or more annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We wanted to see if we could one day design phage therapies that could be resilient against bacterial evolution.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the future, the researchers hope that these technologies could be used to create antibacterial treatments or speed up the design and production of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Woolfson says: 'This has immediate utility in the production of so-called personalised cancer vaccines. These typically take eight to 12 weeks to manufacture, but with the Sidewinder technology that we have developed, we anticipate being able to do this in two to three days' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, experts have previously suggested that the use of AI has the potential to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-15169093/AI-new-VIRUSES-sparking-fears-bioweapon.html"&gt;speed up the production of bioweapons&lt;/a&gt; as well as medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In the future, the scientists say this technology could be used to make new treatments for bacterial infections and cancers &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a paper published last year, researchers used AI to design proteins that could mimic deadly poisons and toxins such as ricin, botulinum, and Shiga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that a large number of these weaponizable DNA codes could slip past the safety filters used by companies that print custom DNA sequences on demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers did this to demonstrate how our current biosafety tools might not be ready for the widespread availability of AI–designed life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Likewise, experts on existential risk have warned that designing bioweapons is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-15126183/rapture-Apocalypse-really-look-like-expert.html"&gt;one of the most dangerous potential applications of AI. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Existential Risk Observatory, which monitors threats to humanity's survival, considers an AI–designed plague to be &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-13197965/Scientists-reveal-realistic-apocalypse-movie.html"&gt;one of the five biggest risks the world faces.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To avoid these new tools being used for dangerous means, the researchers behind Evo2 specifically removed examples from the training data that could teach the AI how to make human pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr King and Dr Hie write: 'Evo cannot generate human viral sequences due to deliberate training data exclusions, preventing both accidental and intentional misuse for pathogen design.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;mol-permabox id="mol-71b1d5f0-fab5-11f0-9f3c-7b4f6cb178ff"&gt;&lt;div class=" mol-factbox sciencetech art-ins" data-version="2" id="mol-4e1b58f0-ce3f-11ed-9252-836f60b7b7be" data-permabox-url="/sciencetech/fb-11916077/Elon-Musks-hatred-AI-explained-Billionaire-believes-spell-end-humans.html"&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, which gathered data from &lt;strong&gt;16 peer-reviewed publications&lt;/strong&gt;, points to promising benefits such as improved blood sugar control, reduced inflammation, enhanced digestion, and cellular protection. Researchers say the time has come to examine bamboo not just as a sustainable resource, but as a functional food with overlooked global relevance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bamboo is already a dietary staple in countries like &lt;strong&gt;China &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;India&lt;/strong&gt;, where it forms part of traditional meals. But despite its nutritional density and rapid cultivation cycle, its potential as a health-supporting food has remained largely absent from Western diets and food science discourse. According to findings published in &lt;em&gt;Advances in Bamboo Science&lt;/em&gt;, this may be about to change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The review, considered the first of its kind, analyzed both human trials and laboratory-based studies, comparing in vivo outcomes with in vitro evidence. Four human studies met inclusion criteria, totaling nearly 5,000 participants. Though limitations exist, the review sets the groundwork for more research into how bamboo products might benefit modern dietary patterns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metabolic Benefits and Glycemic Control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the authors of the review, bamboo shoots may support &lt;strong&gt;glycemic regulation&lt;/strong&gt;, a key factor in managing type 2 diabetes. One included study involving &lt;strong&gt;40 diabetic participants &lt;/strong&gt;observed significantly lower blood &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/sugar-doesnt-spike-insulin-ready-market/" data-type="post" data-id="104016"&gt;sugar &lt;/a&gt;levels after consuming cookies fortified with 20 grams of bamboo shoot powder. The lowest glucose concentrations appeared within &lt;strong&gt;120 minutes&lt;/strong&gt; of intake, indicating a clear dose-response effect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/prisma-flow-chart-advances-in-bamboo-science-1200x727.jpg" alt=" Prisma Flow Chart. © Advances In Bamboo Science" class="wp-image-105247" srcset="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/prisma-flow-chart-advances-in-bamboo-science-scaled.jpg 1200w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/prisma-flow-chart-advances-in-bamboo-science-420x255.jpg 420w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/prisma-flow-chart-advances-in-bamboo-science-520x315.jpg 520w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PRISMA flow chart. © Advances in Bamboo Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another trial cited in the review found that a bamboo shoot-rich diet led to decreased total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, as well as a lower &lt;strong&gt;atherogenic index&lt;/strong&gt;. These outcomes were recorded in a small group of eight healthy women over a series of diet-controlled days. The same study noted a measurable increase in bowel movements and fecal volume, reinforcing the link between bamboo fiber and digestive function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers attribute these effects to bamboo’s high levels of &lt;strong&gt;dietary fiber&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;phytosterols&lt;/strong&gt;, and naturally occurring &lt;strong&gt;vitamins&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;minerals&lt;/strong&gt;, including vitamin B6, thiamine, selenium, and potassium. These compounds, they note, work collectively to modulate lipid and glucose metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digestive Impact and Cellular Protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bamboo’s benefits extend beyond blood markers. Its unique composition of insoluble fibers (particularly &lt;strong&gt;cellulose&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;hemicellulose&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;lignin&lt;/strong&gt;) has shown positive effects on bowel regularity and overall gut performance. Human studies included in the review noted improvements in participants’ digestive health after regular bamboo intake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a randomized clinical trial involving &lt;strong&gt;34 participants&lt;/strong&gt;, extracts derived from bamboo leaves significantly increased the excretion rate of acrylamide, a toxic compound formed during frying. The study found that women who consumed &lt;strong&gt;350 mg&lt;/strong&gt; capsules of antioxidant-rich bamboo extract eliminated acrylamide more efficiently, and showed reduced blood concentrations of acrylamide hemoglobin adducts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the cellular level, in vitro studies reported increased &lt;strong&gt;antioxidant&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;anti-inflammatory activity&lt;/strong&gt;, lower &lt;strong&gt;cell toxicity&lt;/strong&gt;, and enhanced &lt;strong&gt;cell viability&lt;/strong&gt; after exposure to bamboo-derived compounds. One study highlighted the effect of &lt;em&gt;Sasa borealis&lt;/em&gt; water-extract in mitigating oxidative stress in endothelial cells exposed to high glucose concentrations. These findings suggest a protective role for bamboo compounds against cellular damage linked to aging and disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety Concerns and Need for Proper Preparation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite these encouraging signs, the review also flagged potential health risks associated with improper consumption. Raw bamboo shoots from certain species contain &lt;strong&gt;cyanogenic glycosides&lt;/strong&gt;, which can release &lt;strong&gt;cyanide&lt;/strong&gt; during digestion. One &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2773139125000898?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;conducted on 4,852 schoolchildren in India identified a 31% goiter prevalence in areas where bamboo shoots were consumed frequently, despite iodized salt programs being in place.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers linked this phenomenon to the goitrogenic properties of certain compounds in bamboo, including &lt;strong&gt;glucosinolates&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;thiocyanates&lt;/strong&gt;, which may interfere with thyroid function. Animal testing confirmed enlarged thyroid glands and hormonal imbalances in rats fed uncooked bamboo shoots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Professor &lt;a href="https://www.aru.ac.uk/people/lee-smith" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Lee Smith&lt;/a&gt; of Anglia Ruskin University, senior author of the study, stated: “&lt;em&gt;Bamboo is already commonly eaten in parts of Asia and it has huge potential to be a healthy, sustainable addition to diets worldwide – but it must be prepared correctly&lt;/em&gt;.” The review emphasizes that &lt;strong&gt;pre-boiling&lt;/strong&gt; bamboo shoots can neutralize these harmful compounds and render them safe for human consumption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While current data is encouraging, Smith and his co-authors caution that only four studies involving human participants met quality thresholds, calling for “additional high-quality human trials” before any firm dietary recommendations can be made.&lt;/p&gt;

Start choosing the right ones,” Dan wrote in the caption. “The goal isn’t eliminating carbs. It’s eating smarter carbs that work with your deficit, not against it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artContent"&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;The list of five healthy carb sources is presented as follows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Potatoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Potatoes are low in calories, high in fibre, especially the skin,” shared Dan. “This makes them incredibly filling. Also, the resistant starch and high water content help you feel satisfied longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Blueberries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blueberries are rich in fibre and water, which makes them low in calories but highly satiating. The fibre present in the fruit slows digestion and helps keep us full while stabilising blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Lentils&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;“Lentils are loaded with fibre and plant-based protein, both of which are proven to increase satiety and curb hunger,” stated Dan, adding that “lentils are better than rice as a carb source because they contain fewer calories, more fibre, and also higher amounts of protein.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Broccoli&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While broccoli is a green cruciferous vegetable, it is still considered to be a good source of carbohydrates. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dan considers broccoli to be the “perfect” food to volumise meals, as it is rich in fibre and water, which helps us feel full while also providing “an incredible nutrient profile.&lt;/span&gt;” This includes vitamins C and K, and folate, which support metabolism and digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Apples&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Apples are nature’s appetite suppressants,” noted Dan. “They are naturally sweet, low in calories, and high in fibre, which helps you curb hunger and also reduce snacking.” The fibre content in apples also helps regulate blood sugar and keeps us full while being nutrient-dense, providing “vitamins and antioxidants with every bite.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

			&lt;p&gt;January arrives with a familiar hangover. Too much food. Too much drink. Too much screen time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And suddenly social media is full of green juices, charcoal supplements, foot patches, and seven-day "liver resets", all promising to purge the body of mysterious toxins and return it to a purer state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first episode of &lt;a href="https://pod.link/1866947239"&gt;Strange Health&lt;/a&gt;, a new visualised podcast from The Conversation, hosts Katie Edwards and Dan Baumgardt put detox culture under the microscope and ask a simple question: Do we actually need to detox at all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tomatoes-dont-kill-humans-and-we-just-figured-out-why"&gt;Tomatoes Don't Kill Humans, And We Just Figured Out Why&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/introducing-strange-health-a-new-video-podcast-from-the-conversation-272766"&gt;Strange Health&lt;/a&gt; explores the weird, surprising, and sometimes alarming things our bodies do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each episode takes a popular health or wellness trend, viral claim, or bodily mystery and examines what the evidence really says, with help from researchers who study this stuff for a living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katie Edwards, a health and medicine editor at The Conversation, and Dan Baumgardt, a GP and lecturer in health and life sciences at the University of Bristol, share a longstanding fascination with the body's improbabilities and limits, plus a healthy scepticism for claims that sound too good to be true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This opening episode dives straight into detoxing. From juice cleanses and detox teas to charcoal pills, foot pads, and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="189752" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; enemas, Katie and Dan watch, wince, and occasionally laugh their way through some of the internet's most popular detox trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along the way, they ask what these products claim to remove, how they supposedly work, and why feeling worse is often reframed online as a sign that a detox is "working".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The episode also features an interview with Trish Lalor, a liver expert from the University of Birmingham, whose message is refreshingly blunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your body is really set up to do it by itself," she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The liver, working alongside the kidneys and gut, already detoxifies the body around the clock. For most healthy people, Lalor says, there is no need for extreme interventions or pricey supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That does not mean everything labelled "detox" is harmless. Lalor explains where certain ingredients can help, where they make little difference, and where they can cause real damage if misused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-estimates-millions-in-us-risk-liver-damage-from-herbal-remedies"&gt;Study Estimates Millions in US Risk Liver Damage From Herbal Remedies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real detoxing looks less like a sachet or a foot patch and more like hydration, fibre, rest, moderation, and giving your liver time to do the job it already does remarkably well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're buying detox patches and supplements, then it's probably your wallet that is about to be cleansed, not your liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/katie-edwards-111340"&gt;Katie Edwards&lt;/a&gt;, Commissioning Editor, Health + Medicine and Host of Strange Health podcast, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/the-conversation-1502"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/dan-baumgardt-1451396"&gt;Dan Baumgardt&lt;/a&gt;, Senior Lecturer, School of Psychology and Neuroscience, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/university-of-bristol-1211"&gt;University of Bristol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

While there are plenty of natural ways to boost your immune system, new research points to a supplement that may help curb severe reactions to the flu: vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the takeaway from new research published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002916525007713" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; For the study, researchers analyzed health data from 36,258 people who participated in the UK Biobank, a long-term biomedical research resource.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that people with a severe &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65478355/vitamin-d-deficiency-risk-factors/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D deficiency;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin D deficiency&lt;/a&gt; (measured as less than 15 nmol/L) had a 33% higher rate of being hospitalized for a respiratory tract infection compared to those who had vitamin D levels of 75 nmol/L or higher. For each 10 nmol/L increase in vitamin D, the hospitalization rate for respiratory tract infections dropped by 4%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:18%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;18%&lt;/a&gt; of Americans have inadequate vitamin D levels, this is worth paying attention to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/3528/amesh-adalja" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amesh A.

Here’s what doctors and a dietitian want you to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why may vitamin D lower the risk of severe respiratory infection?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers didn’t dive into that, but doctors aren’t shocked by these findings. “Vitamin D plays a role in optimal immune system function,” says &lt;a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/3528/amesh-adalja" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amesh A.

Adalja, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D enhances both your &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279396/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:innate immunity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;innate immunity&lt;/a&gt;—your body’s first line of defense against pathogens—and your &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/adaptive-immunity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:adaptive immunity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;adaptive immunity&lt;/a&gt;, which is the part of your immune system that “learns” to fight certain germs after you’ve been exposed to them, explains &lt;a href="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=trusso" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Thomas Russo, M.D.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Thomas Russo, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; a professor and chief of infectious diseases at the University at Buffalo in New York. “Appropriate vitamin D concentrations are important for an optimal immune response,” he says, noting that even having a “moderate” deficiency in vitamin D may impact your immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s important to keep two things in mind with this particular study: One is that it’s observational, so researchers simply found an association between having low vitamin D and a greater risk of serious infection. The other is that they focused on those with a severe deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The literature around vitamin D [supplementation] is yes and no in terms of whether it’s helpful,” says &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:William Schaffner, M.D.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;William Schaffner, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. “It would appear the more severe your vitamin D deficiency is, the more likely your immune system is not functioning optimally.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much vitamin D do you need?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommended daily allowance (RDA) of vitamin D depends on your age and life stage. However, most adults should get 600 international units (IU) daily, according to the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/#h4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; (NIH). (People who are 70 and older should have 800 IU of vitamin D.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the signs I’m not getting enough vitamin D?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D deficiency is more common in people who are lactose intolerant, follow a vegan diet, or those who have limited exposure to sunlight, per the NIH. Symptoms of low vitamin D can be vague or even hard to detect at all, but these are commonly linked to the status, according to Jessica Cording, R.D., C.D.N., author of &lt;em&gt;The Little Book of Game-Changers&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to get more vitamin D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposure to the sun is the most common way people get vitamin D, but it’s also possible to get the nutrient from foods. These are the biggest vitamin D sources, per the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/#h4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NIH;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cod liver oil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trout&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salmon,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mushrooms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortified milk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortified cereal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you can also get vitamin D from a supplement, Dr. Russo points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should you take a vitamin D supplement for immune health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It depends. It’s always important to check with a healthcare provider before taking any kind of supplement, Dr. Schaffner says. In the case of vitamin D, your doctor will likely recommend that you get a blood test to measure your vitamin D levels to see if you have a deficiency, Dr. Adalja says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is this important? Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, which means that it can build up in your body if you take in too much. “Don’t start taking excessive amounts or you could get into trouble with high calcium levels in your blood,” Dr. Russo says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But doctors also say that many people in temperate climates are likely to have lower-than-optimal vitamin D levels. If that describes you, “supplementation with a daily vitamin D pill is a generally good practice,” Dr. Adalja says. (Again, just check in with your healthcare provider first to be sure.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of a flu-prevention strategy, Dr. Russo says that things like getting vaccinated, avoiding people who are obviously sick, and wearing a mask in crowded indoor settings are still better. “A vitamin D supplement is one more piece that may help,” he says. “There’s little harm as long as you don’t overdo it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dr. Schaffner stops short of recommending that everyone take a vitamin D supplement for immune health. “If you have a special concern or interest in this, you can get a blood test,” he says. “Your doctor can tell you if you ought to take a supplement based on that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNLXF0ZHN2OWllRy1HalA2MWF3YVcyY2g4RlZHa3JFOVF5YnM0SDJPX040Wld1QncyQTJUYW1QNlI4NTB0Y293UzB1UGNjb1luWHNGdkdOLVVaU2xjSF8zSlRueXF1N1JoTFY3Y1BRUXFDblpBVEFKOU1nVWdjTjg4Mkp2N1NORV80</guid></item><item><title>谁更有可能活到100岁：肉食者还是素食者？ -《独立报》</title><link>https://www.independent.co.uk/bulletin/news/meat-vegetarian-plant-based-study-b2907626.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-1d79dbf-0 hcasuI"&gt;&lt;h3 class="sc-erjdy9-0 jlkJyB"&gt;Thank you for registering&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1ty8yds-2 fZeRAk"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1ty8yds-0 bbjlNt"&gt;Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1ty8yds-1 SkKtY"&gt;Please refresh your browser to be logged in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 11:46:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNSXNHekR2M1ViNjloZWdKM1p6dGFfTEJCVjRWalp6aDdrWEVZS1dVb0JFbVVkQUFEN3JRTUVlLUFIdDYwSFdNYW5hUTNrQTllVWpFUE5ueGFud1c5a3Q2SGlKcnB4a2RFRExxcXh2TlJaUjBGaVpzRzhOZXBYOVhxeU5kYzNIOW1KTzFMSG1QYXVjY092Q0E</guid></item><item><title>你的阴茎真的是长寿的指标吗？布莱恩·约翰逊是这么认为的—真正的专家权衡-纽约邮报</title><link>https://nypost.com/2026/01/26/health/is-your-penis-an-indicator-of-longevity-experts-weigh-in/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom"&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;World-renowned biohacker Bryan Johnson is raising eyebrows for his &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/28/health/bryan-johnson-credits-shockwave-therapy-and-botox-for-titanic-erections/"&gt;shocking approach&lt;/a&gt; to erectile health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Johnson — whose mantra is, “Don’t Die” — takes Cialis, receives penile Botox and even undergoes low-intensity shockwave therapy to his, uh, johnson to improve blood flow, enhance erections and achieve sexual performance comparable to a teenager’s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Nighttime erections are, like, a really important health marker,” Johnson, 48, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qriveAV7BY" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said in 2024&lt;/a&gt;. “Men who do not have nighttime erections are 70% more likely to die prematurely. It predicts death.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Biohacker Bryan Johnson is a big proponent of penile health as a key marker of biological age. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;YouTube/, The Diary Of A CEO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s not the only longevity-seeker making waves with his rigid regimen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fitness guru Ben Greenfield, 44, has experimented with &lt;a href="https://bengreenfieldlife.com/article/biohacking-articles/the-most-potent-natural-alternative-to-viagra/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;acoustic wave therapy&lt;/a&gt; and, stunningly, &lt;a href="https://bengreenfieldlife.com/article/get-effects-stem-cell-dick-injectionwithout-actually-getting-stem-cell-dick-injection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;stem cell injections&lt;/a&gt; to optimize sexual performance and vitality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So is penile health a true barometer of longevity? Are these biohackers playing the long game &lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; or overextending themselves for a pipe dream?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Post spoke with two experts about the rising interest in biohacking the penis — they shared their tip-down philosophies for protecting the crown jewels for the decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How does penile health reflect overall health?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Penis health is &lt;a href="https://www.browardurologycenter.com/pdf/International-Index-of-Erectile-Function-IIEF-Questionnaire.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;measured in many ways&lt;/a&gt;, [namely] erectile dysfunction (ED), orgasmic function, libido, satisfaction with intercourse and overall satisfaction,” &lt;a href="https://ryanweltermd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Ryan Welter&lt;/a&gt;, a pioneer in regenerative cellular therapy and founder of &lt;a href="https://regenerismedical.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Regeneris Medical&lt;/a&gt;, told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Declines in penile health — particularly ED — have been established as an early predictor of cardiovascular disease, often appearing two to five years before a heart attack, Welter added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Penile arteries are significantly smaller than the arteries that supply the heart and brain, meaning they often show the first signs of plaque buildup.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;High cholesterol and plaque buildup reduce the blood flow needed for an erection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Penile arteries are significantly smaller than the arteries that supply the heart and brain, meaning they often show the first signs of plaque buildup. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;creativebubble – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nerve damage is also a major reason for ED because it affects signals from the brain to the pelvis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nerve degeneration is common with age — it’s also a hallmark of diabetes, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, Parkinson’s disease, stroke and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And finally, imbalances in sex hormones can pave the way for ED. &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/09/12/health/the-truth-about-manopause-and-slow-insidious-signs-men-overlook/"&gt;Low testosterone&lt;/a&gt; reduces libido and the ability to get and maintain erections.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Furthermore, and this is important, happiness is one of the best predictors of longevity,” Welter said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Sexual dysfunction and depressed sexual satisfaction are indicators of unhappiness and need to be treated if longevity is the goal.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are the red flags of poor erectile health?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Typically, men, over time, will experience erections that are not as firm as they used to be, difficulty maintaining the erection over time [and] changes in nocturnal and morning erections,” aesthetic nurse practitioner &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/injectorchris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Chris Bustamante&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the NYC men’s clinic &lt;a href="https://www.lushfulaesthetics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Lushful Aesthetics&lt;/a&gt;, told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It might take them longer to ejaculate or [they] may ejaculate faster. Typically, longer is more normal with age.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sudden, drastic changes to the quality, frequency and duration of erections — especially when accompanied by symptoms like rapid weight gain, shortness of breath or fatigue — should warrant an urgent visit to the doctor, who will evaluate the cardiovascular system, hormone levels and the presence of any tumors, Bustamante said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s why it’s important to track morning and nocturnal erections and their general hardness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Semen is not as good of a biomarker as erections, some experts say. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;RHJ – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For his part, Johnson uses an &lt;a href="https://www.talktoadam.com/products/adam-sensor" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Adam Health sensor&lt;/a&gt; ($249) to measure his nighttime erections, garnering data on their duration, frequency and quality to generate an erection health score.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said he also tracks his sperm count, movement and shape, penile blood flow, urination speed and prostate size.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Bustamante said erections are stronger benchmarks than semen characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is just kind of normal sometimes for [the] volume of semen to decline with age,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It also varies a lot from man to man, already from the beginning. So some men naturally have higher volume loads of semen versus others.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are the common treatments for ED?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The single most important treatment for longevity and health span, particularly for the penis, is diet and exercise and maintaining good metabolic health,” Welter said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a hard-and-fast rule, Bustamante said, you need to focus on consuming fruits, vegetables and fiber and limit red meat for its saturated fat content and processed foods for their trans fats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Red meat and processed foods can raise blood pressure because of their high levels of sodium, saturated fats and preservatives. High blood pressure causes ED by damaging and narrowing blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Strength training is critical for penile health because it enhances blood flow, boosts testosterone and improves vascular function. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Chanakon – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In terms of exercise, Bustamante said it’s important to build muscle since “muscle is the organ of longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He recommends 30 minutes of daily cardio, but warns against one popular activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We do see a higher correlation of ED when it comes to cyclists,” Bustamante said.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t matter if you have a special, fancy seat or not,” he added. “Putting all that pressure on your perineum (the skin and tissue between your genitals and your anus) does sort of damage these nerves and vessels over time.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle changes aside, Bustamante said low doses of Cialis relax smooth muscles in the prostate, bladder neck and penis to boost urine flow and facilitate erections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What about those expensive biohacker tools?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Over time, men’s penises become desensitized — part of that is through sex and masturbation, and part of it is just through general aging,” Bustamante said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Helping to resensitize that tissue is a really important factor in terms of overall performance.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s why some biohackers are going so far as to embrace low-intensity focused shockwave devices. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bustamante said these gizmos emit sound waves that cause micro-injuries in penile tissue, triggering the growth of new blood vessels and increased blood circulation to improve penile sensitivity and function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shockwave therapy and acoustic wave therapy are often used interchangeably, so it’s important to know what you’re really getting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;This is an example of a shockwave device. Thankfully, it’s being used on a person’s shin in this picture. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;puhimec – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In general, shockwave therapy uses intense, high-energy acoustic waves, while acoustic therapy often refers to gentler, lower-intensity waves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is not going to be strong enough to actually penetrate the depth of this tissue,” Bustamante said of acoustic wave therapy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s going to be very, very superficial, and so, therefore, it just really is not impactful.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For its part, Botox temporarily relaxes muscles by blocking nerve signals that cause muscle contraction.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Bustamante said that when it’s injected into the penis, patients tend to notice they can achieve firmer, quicker erections. But Botox typically lasts only three to four months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This treatment is really great to just improve someone’s quality of life when it comes to erectile function,” Bustamante said, adding that it can enhance the effectiveness of Cialis and Viagra.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;As for penile stem cell injections, this treatment has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s considered experimental, with no strong evidence of safety or effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bustamante also warns against the increasingly popular practice of injecting salmon sperm derivatives into the penile area, as it can cause infections, allergic reactions and probably some funky smells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, he recommends and administers &lt;a href="https://www.lushfulaesthetics.com/sexual-enhancement-services/p-shot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;“P-shots,”&lt;/a&gt; injections of platelet-rich plasma from the patient’s own blood into the penis to boost blood flow and stimulate tissue repair.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These modalities, such as shockwave and P-shot, are really beneficial in terms of people experiencing better sex lives,” Bustamante said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Worth a shot — or a shock — to get up and running?&lt;/p&gt;

My uncle found me a couple of days later, having driven around town constantly looking for me the moment he heard about what had happened. He was a total wild man, but he put a roof over my head when nobody else would, gave me unconditional love, and helped me find my way. He helped me get into college, and he paid for it.&lt;/p&gt;

He also left me the house I grew up in, a large amount of money, and a successful business. Suddenly, my parents and my brothers, whom I’ve not spoken to in nearly two decades, are “reaching out.” It’s heartbreaking because I’ve always wanted my family back, but I am not stupid enough to believe that they have any interest in me. Is there a pathway for reconciliation here? Or am I just kidding myself? Am I a fool for wanting these people in my life? Or to even believe that could happen on my terms?&lt;/p&gt;

It also doesn’t make you “stupid” to believe that they would miss you, too. Many families struggle with what to do when loved ones are doing drugs and juggle two options: getting them support or giving them so-called “tough love.” It seems your parents might have thought the latter was the right thing to do. We can guess at their flawed rationale, but this doesn’t negate your feelings. They abandoned you when you were a child, and it will feel like abandonment, no matter what their intent might have been. But if you truly want to reconcile, and if you feel emotionally ready, you can always have an initial conversation. That second caveat is &lt;em&gt;crucial&lt;/em&gt; for you think about here. You’re already in a vulnerable place with the death of your uncle. You might want to consult a therapist on your own to discuss if you’re truly ready to handle seeing them again.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="127" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmkr1rhvp00153b79hdmh40kw@published"&gt;If you do decide to see them, I would first think of a neutral place you can meet where you feel comfortable. Is there a coffee shop or a park you go to often? Maybe you all can grab a smoothie and walk around your neighborhood if the weather’s nice. I find that it’s easier for me to have tough conversations on walks because I can look elsewhere when I need to. A good family therapist could help you all confront these old feelings together and start a fresh, new relationship on better terms. But know you can always put space between yourself and them again if you need to. None of this is binding, and you’re allowed to change your mind and follow what feels right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health authorities across Asia are intensifying surveillance and travel screening after India confirmed multiple cases of Nipah virus, including infections among two nurses at a private hospital in West Bengal, a development that has raised renewed concern over hospital-based transmission of the deadly pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak has prompted airport screenings in Thailand, heightened border checks in Nepal, and moves by Taiwan to classify Nipah virus infection as a top-tier notifiable disease, reflecting growing regional anxiety over one of the world’s most lethal zoonotic viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section" id="Hospital_Transmission_Sparks_Alarm_in_India"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hospital Transmission Sparks Alarm in India&lt;span class="ez-toc-section-end"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

Indian health officials confirmed that &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://beaconbio.org/en/report/?reportid=3ce9d27f-e3df-4f8b-98da-79cb0159f90c&amp;amp;eventid=75e28dfa-b236-4631-8f19-d63f1565847d"&gt;two nurses working at Narayana Multispeciality Hospital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in Barasat, around 16 miles from Kolkata, tested positive for Nipah virus. One of the nurses remains in critical condition, while the other is hospitalized.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to West Bengal’s Health and Family Welfare Department, the nurses were on duty together between December 28 and 30. They developed high fever and respiratory distress within days and were admitted to intensive care on January 4 as their conditions deteriorated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7681034087578164" data-ad-slot="1224161412" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preliminary investigations suggest both nurses were infected while treating a patient with severe respiratory symptoms who later died before Nipah testing could be carried out. That patient is now being treated as the suspected index case, and authorities say investigations are ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials emphasized that the case was likely missed rather than misdiagnosed, highlighting how easily Nipah infections can evade early detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are expanding the criteria for testing so clinicians know when to suspect Nipah and when to order broader diagnostic panels,” said a senior official involved in West Bengal’s surveillance efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section" id="Quarantine_Contact_Tracing_and_Nationwide_Alerts"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Quarantine, Contact Tracing, and Nationwide Alerts&lt;span class="ez-toc-section-end"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak triggered immediate quarantine and emergency surveillance measures in the region. So far, 180 people have been tested, with 20 high-risk contacts quarantined. All have tested negative and remain asymptomatic, but officials said they will be retested before the end of the 21-day incubation period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has issued a nationwide alert, urging states to strengthen surveillance, detection, and infection-control measures to prevent further spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several states, including &lt;a href="https://telanganatoday.com/tamil-nadu-steps-up-surveillance-after-nipah-cases-in-west-bengal"&gt;Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt;, have instructed hospitals to intensify monitoring of Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) cases, a broad clinical category that can mask Nipah infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Persons admitted with AES, particularly those with travel or contact history linked to West Bengal, should be closely monitored and evaluated for possible Nipah virus infection,” one advisory stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health experts warn that misidentifying Nipah as AES or common respiratory illness has serious consequences, especially for healthcare workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have repeatedly seen human-to-human transmission occurring within hospital settings,” said Ali Althaf, a senior health official in Kerala with extensive experience managing Nipah outbreaks. “When cases are not recognised early, healthcare workers are placed at the highest risk of exposure to this often fatal virus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerala, which has faced multiple Nipah outbreaks in recent years, recorded more than 100 AES cases last year. Experts say broader diagnostic testing could reveal more Nipah infections that currently go undetected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section" id="Regional_Response_Expands_Beyond_India"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Regional Response Expands Beyond India&lt;span class="ez-toc-section-end"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As concern spreads beyond India’s borders, Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health has begun screening passengers arriving from India at Suvarnabhumi and Don Mueang airports, focusing on travelers from West Bengal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities have also issued “Health Beware Cards” advising travelers to seek medical attention if symptoms develop within 21 days of arrival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-4"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7681034087578164" data-ad-slot="1224161412" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nepal has stepped up health checks at Tribhuvan International Airport and major land border crossings, with intensified surveillance in Koshi Province.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.icrt.com.tw/info_details.php?mlevel1=6&amp;amp;mlevel2=12&amp;amp;news_id=296583"&gt;Taiwan’s Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; announced plans to classify Nipah virus infection as a Category 5 notifiable disease, reserved for rare or emerging infections posing major public health risks. The proposal is currently undergoing a public consultation period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the move, Taiwan has maintained a Level 2 “yellow” travel alert only for Kerala, a known Nipah hotspot, while monitoring developments in West Bengal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section" id="A_Virus_With_No_Cure_and_High_Fatality_Rates"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A Virus With No Cure and High Fatality Rates&lt;span class="ez-toc-section-end"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/nipah-virus"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, the Nipah virus is classified as a priority pathogen due to its epidemic potential. There is no approved vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7681034087578164" data-ad-slot="1224161412" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The virus is carried primarily by fruit bats of the Pteropus species and can spread to humans through contaminated food, contact with infected animals such as pigs, or exposure to bodily fluids. Limited human-to-human transmission has been documented, particularly in healthcare settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fatality rates in past outbreaks have ranged from 40 percent to as high as 75 percent. Symptoms can begin with fever, vomiting, and fatigue before progressing to &lt;a href="https://nchstats.com/public-health-experts-nervous-about-bird-flu/"&gt;severe respiratory illness&lt;/a&gt; and fatal encephalitis. In some cases, neurological complications have appeared months or even years after infection.&lt;/p&gt;

Newer and less studied, nano-hydroxyapatite is a version of hydroxyapatite with small, rod-shaped particles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hydroxyapatite is natural.

"The European Commission's Scientific Committee raised concerns due to the lack of long-term safety data on ingestion, particularly in children," she says.

"This concentration has demonstrated reliable enamel restoration while maintaining product stability and usability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, she states that newer formulations are experimenting with lower concentrations and enhanced delivery systems (such as encapsulation or synergistic minerals), which may improve efficacy at reduced levels. "The effectiveness isn't just about percentage, it's also about particle quality and how it's delivered to the tooth surface," she explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tolmie adds, "Effective repair starts as low as 5% and plateaus around 10-15%. Several studies show that 5% n-HAp can mend enamel dings, divots and dents in the teeth, with benefits leveling off somewhere between 10% and 15%. One review even noted that 5% sometimes beats 10% because fewer particles clump, making them easier to slip into enamel defects; hence, most US brands sit comfortably in the 5-10% sweet spot."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also reached out to Dr. Foti Panagakos, who's a part of &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" data-id="3bb98603-682a-4002-8af7-96e05d45f81b" href="https://www.boka.com/pages/oral-health-advisory-committee" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Boka's Oral Health Advisory Committee&lt;/a&gt;. "While there is a lot of discussion around nano-hydroxyapatite concentration and its effectiveness, what matters most is how it is formulated and the fact that the ingredient is backed by research," he explains. "This includes how nano-hydroxyapatite is stabilized, delivered and supported by other ingredients, which is why at Boka, years were spent working with oral health professionals to ensure our formula delivers on both safety and performance.

"Fluoride remains the gold standard for cavity prevention, supported by decades of large-scale, randomized controlled trials," she explains. "However, for patients seeking a fluoride alternative -- whether due to sensitivity, allergies, personal preferences or a desire for a biomimetic approach -- nano-hydroxyapatite provides a scientifically supported option."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Academy of Biomimetic Dentistry, a &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" data-id="a62419d5-d5c1-4ee6-a0ea-11d991054d80" href="https://www.aobmd.org/what-is-biomimetic-dentistry/" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;biomimetic approach&lt;/a&gt; is one in which damaged teeth are restored using materials mimicking natural teeth in function, strength and appearance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For high-risk patients, Eversgerd recommends fluoride, while she may recommend n-Ha to low-risk or fluoride-averse individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Austin seconds this, but adds that she also recommends fluoride toothpaste to children with poor brushing habits or communities with limited dental access. "nHA is a great option, but it's not a one-size-fits-all replacement for fluoride -- yet," Austin says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lieb explains that nHA may also be a compelling alternative for patients with aesthetic concerns, such as whitening-induced sensitivity, and individuals in preventive care regimens post-restorative treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pinto agrees that it depends on the person, stating, "For most of my patients, especially those with low to moderate cavity risk, nano-hydroxyapatite is an excellent option; gentler on the mouth, less drying and effective at rebuilding early damage. For people with high cavity risk, fluoride might still be the best choice, at least short term. For my high-risk patients, I often recommend a combo toothpaste that includes both ingredients when appropriate." Ultimately, if a patient isn't high risk and has health or safety concerns about fluoride, she thinks hydroxyapatite is a great option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked if there's a reason people should choose n-HAp over other anti-cavity toothpastes, Tolmie answers, "No, as long as patients are brushing their teeth with an anti-cavity toothpaste. There are differences in the way an n-HAp toothpaste and a fluoride toothpaste work to prevent decay, and some n-HAp toothpastes may feel smoother on the teeth. But anti-cavity toothpastes as a whole accomplish the same task. Do I wash a car with tap water or bottled water? We know that both of them get the job done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's most important, according to Tolmie, is that patients ensure they're not swallowing toothpaste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does the American Dental Association think? Cooper states that the ADA recommends brushing teeth twice daily for two minutes with fluoride toothpaste, as the naturally occurring mineral has been proven to remineralize weakened enamel and reverse early signs of tooth decay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Additionally, the fluoride you take in from drinking water and other beverages continues to provide a topical benefit because it becomes part of your saliva, constantly bathing the teeth and helping to rebuild weakened tooth enamel," Cooper further explains. "The best scientific evidence has shown that &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/medical/fluoride-why-drinking-water-safe-children/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;adding fluoride to community water&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; supplies is safe and effective.

Plus, Eversgerd adds that more long-term, large-scale trials are needed to fully validate whether it's equal to fluoride in preventing cavities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked if it's effective, Austin says, "Yes -- particularly for enamel remineralization and sensitivity. In my practice, I've seen patients who switched to nHA toothpaste experience noticeable improvements in comfort, plaque control and surface smoothness.

However, she advises that patients with moderate to high cavity risk not fully abandon fluoride. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, it's important to note that the "ADA recommends that adults brush their teeth twice daily with fluoride toothpaste for at least two minutes each time, or as directed by a licensed dentist," according to Cooper.

However, about 90% of Americans consume too much of it, according to the American Heart Association. Excessive sodium raises the risk of high blood pressure, a risk factor for issues such as cardiovascular disease, long-term kidney disease and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In the United States, most sodium intake comes from foods prepared outside the home, experts say. "Americans on average get about 75% of their food from processed food of some kind—either processed foods from grocery stores, or foods that are bought at restaurants or fast-food restaurants," Dr. Daniel Jones, professor and dean emeritus at the University of Mississippi School of Medicine and chair of the 2025 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Blood Pressure Guideline, told ABC News. Manufacturers often add salt to processed foods in order to prolong shelf life and enhance flavor. Minimal cuts in salt, which the researchers said would not greatly affect taste, may have a significant health impact. American adults consume on average 3,500 milligrams of sodium daily, well above the AHA-recommended limit of 2,300 mg, or a tablespoon of salt, said Dr. Latha Palaniappan, associate dean for research at Stanford University School of Medicine. The daily limit for those with high blood pressure is even lower at 1,500 mg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;While processed foods may be difficult to entirely avoid, experts say cutting back on them may lead to meaningful health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"One of the things I advise my patients about is to shop as much as they can on the periphery of the grocery store. That’s generally where fresh foods are," Jones said. Natural whole foods, like fresh produce, are especially healthy. "I tell my patients to eat foods with peels, not packages, to lower their overall intake of sodium," Palaniappan said.

&lt;p&gt;Scientists at Moffitt Cancer Center have created a new method to forecast how cancer cells evolve as they gain or lose entire chromosomes. These large-scale genetic changes can give tumors an advantage, helping them grow faster, adapt to stress, and resist treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, introduces a computational tool called ALFA-K. It analyzes longitudinal, single-cell data to trace how cancer cells move through different chromosome combinations over time. By doing this, the method identifies which chromosome patterns are favored as tumors evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results challenge the idea that cancer evolution is driven by chance alone. Instead, the study shows that tumors follow measurable patterns shaped by chromosome makeup, evolutionary pressures, and treatment-related stress. This framework offers a new way to anticipate how cancers change and how they may respond to therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&amp;amp;A with &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noemi Andor, Ph.D.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, corresponding author and associate member in the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrated Mathematical Oncology Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; at Moffitt. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What problem were you trying to solve with this research, and why does it matter for understanding cancer? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer evolves. As tumors grow, their cells constantly make mistakes when copying and dividing their DNA. Many of those mistakes involve gaining or losing whole chromosomes. This creates a mix of cancer cells with different chromosome combinations inside the same tumor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem was that researchers had no reliable way to determine which of those combinations help cancer cells survive. The number of possible chromosome states is enormous, and most existing approaches could only capture snapshots in time or average behavior across many cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALFA-K was developed to solve this problem by using longitudinal, single-cell data to reconstruct how cancer cells move through chromosome states over time and which states are favored by evolution. Without that understanding, cancer progression and treatment resistance can appear unpredictable. Our work shows they follow measurable rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are chromosome changes so important for tumor growth and treatment response? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chromosomes contain hundreds or thousands of genes. When a cancer cell gains or loses a chromosome, it changes the dosage of many genes at once. This can immediately alter how the cell grows, divides or responds to stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These changes allow cancer cells to make large evolutionary jumps rather than small adjustments. They also create diversity within a tumor, which increases the chances that some cells survive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the effects of these changes depend on a cell's existing chromosome makeup. The same chromosome change can be helpful in one context and harmful in another. This context dependence helps explain why cancer evolution has been so difficult to predict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is ALFA-K different from previous tools, and what does it allow researchers to do? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before ALFA-K, chromosome changes were often assumed to have fixed effects. Researchers sometimes treated gaining or losing a chromosome as always beneficial or always harmful. Real cancer evolution is more complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALFA-K tracks thousands of individual cells over time, accounting for ongoing chromosome instability and reconstructs local fitness landscapes. These landscapes describe how advantageous or harmful a chromosome change is given a cell's current chromosome configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool also shows that the rate of chromosome errors matters. When chemotherapy increases chromosome mis-segregation, cancer cells move across these landscapes more quickly. Depending on the landscape's shape, this can push tumors toward chromosome states that are more tolerant of instability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, ALFA-K estimated the fitness of more than 270,000 distinct chromosome configurations. This made it possible to ask questions that were previously inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does whole-genome doubling mean, and why is it an important finding? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole-genome doubling occurs when a cell copies all of its chromosomes. Previous research showed that this can help cancer cells survive, but there was no way to measure how much protection it provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALFA-K allows researchers to quantify that buffering effect. The method measures how much more tolerant genome-doubled cells are to chromosome mistakes compared with non-doubled cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This matters because buffering is not all or nothing. There is a threshold at which genome doubling becomes advantageous. By quantifying that threshold, ALFA-K turns genome doubling from a descriptive observation into a predictable evolutionary event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How could this research eventually help guide cancer treatment? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALFA-K shifts cancer research from describing what tumors look like to predicting how they will evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, this approach could help doctors interpret repeat biopsies, identify when a tumor is approaching a dangerous evolutionary transition and choose treatments that limit cancer's ability to explore harmful chromosome configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-term goal is evolution-aware cancer therapy. This approach aims to anticipate how tumors will change rather than reacting after resistance has already emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study was supported by the National Cancer Institute (1R37CA266727-01A1, 1R21CA269415-01A1, 1R03CA259873-01A1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;p&gt;María Teresa Pérez Zaballos spent five years visiting doctors before she got her diagnosis. She saw a gynecologist and a neuropathic pain specialist, had her digestive system checked, and took “a ton” of urinary tests. Eventually, she carried a packet of documents to each appointment, to show doctors all the conditions the others had already decided she didn’t have. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was when most people were saying, ‘no, no, no,’ that somebody said it might be endometriosis,” Pérez Zaballos said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pérez Zaballos, who lives in Paris, was working at the pharmaceutical company Merck, where she was involved in research identifying a biomarker for a rare cancer. “And I was thinking: How come we have nothing remotely similar in endometriosis?”&lt;/p&gt;

Would potential Narcan-appliers be compelled to stand down? If Narcan was used to revive said user, could the reviver be sued or otherwise held liable? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;—Dean R.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;I don’t mean to go all Professor Snape on you, Dean, but your question seems to betray a pretty spotty understanding of both do-not-resuscitate orders and narcotic-antagonist treatments. (Also, your “strength potion” seems to have caused your friend Longbottom here to grow antlers.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In any case, the answer to both of your questions is probably no. For starters, as a legal matter, “Do Not Resuscitate” does not mean “Do not provide lifesaving care of any kind,” it only means “Do not administer CPR.” And CPR—as I’m sure we all remember from that three-day unit we had in health class in 1989—is only indicated in cases where the patient isn’t breathing and has no heartbeat, a state that less-enlightened generations used to refer to as “dead.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:html-block-f0fFsJJApdG78II" data-fusion-component="html-block-f0fFsJJApdG78II"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;broadstreet-zone zone-id="169550"&gt;&lt;/broadstreet-zone&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:html-block-f0fFsJJApdG78II" data-fusion-component="html-block-f0fFsJJApdG78II"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;That’s the point of a DNR. A sufferer who’s successfully departed this vale of tears has the right (if they so choose) not to be dragged kicking and screaming back into it with chest compressions, electric shocks, and breathing tubes. However, that’s not the case in your scenario. Narcan requires circulating blood to work, so if the victim is dead enough for a DNR to kick in, they should be too dead for Narcan to save them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Granted, things in real life aren’t always so clear-cut. One can imagine edge cases where CPR and Narcan together might bring a deceased opioid victim back around. Also, in practice, doctors may use a subject’s DNR as a proxy for how aggressively to pursue invasive, last-gasp treatment options in general. Luckily, you don’t need to worry about any of that, for one very important reason: You’re not a medical professional, and thus are not bound by legal and ethical standards like honoring someone’s DNR order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;So relax, guy! Under modern Good Samaritan laws, not only will you not be sued for administering Narcan to a fallen addict, you’ll probably be held harmless even if you perform CPR on someone with “Do Not Resuscitate” written across their chest in 2-inch-high neon. For a hospital, something like that could mean a seven-figure “wrongful prolongation of life” judgment, but for a regular schmuck like you?

    &lt;p&gt;People will also begin receiving alerts via the NHS App to notify them when a screening kit is being sent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NHS estimates the move could help detect around 600 additional bowel cancers early each year in England – an increase of about 11 per cent – and identify 2,000 more people with high-risk polyps, allowing preventative surgery before cancer develops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The home-testing kit, known as the faecal immunochemical test (FIT), is offered to everyone over 50. It checks for blood in a small stool sample, which can be a sign of bowel cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By lowering the threshold from 120 micrograms of blood per gram of faeces to 80, the NHS expects to offer 35 per cent more screening colonoscopies each year to diagnose or rule out the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change comes as the NHS prepares to launch digital alerts to boost screening uptake, as part of a radical new National Cancer Plan, to be published next week, to transform cancer care by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Johnson, national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, said: “This is a major step forward in bowel cancer detection and will help save hundreds more lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;‘Better early-warning system’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Testing at a lower threshold will provide a better early-warning system, helping us spot and treat cancers earlier, often before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Earlier detection can mean less intensive treatment and ensures the best chance of survival. In many cases, people could avoid facing cancer altogether by having dangerous polyps removed before they cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would strongly encourage everyone who is sent a bowel screening test to complete it and return it as soon as possible. It really could make all the difference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genevieve Edwards, the chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK, said the move marked “an important moment” for screening in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said: “Increasing the sensitivity of the test means more cancers will be prevented and found earlier, saving more lives from the UK’s fourth most common cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Menopause may be best known for hot flashes and mood swings, but it can also come with many other less talked-about symptoms, including skin changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that a majority of women report skin problems as they age — in particular, one they might not have experienced since their teen years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Amy Wechsler, a dual board-certified dermatologist and psychiatrist in Manhattan, specializes in &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/22/health/constance-zimmer-reveals-how-iud-messed-with-menopause-transition/"&gt;treating perimenopausal &lt;/a&gt;and menopausal women who are battling acne — sometimes for the first time in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For them, it’s just horrible because they’ve never had it — it’s so foreign to them,” she told Fox News Digital. “There’s so much psychological overlap and effects of acne on people in terms of lowering self-esteem and self-confidence, and causing anxiety and sometimes depression.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Midlife paradox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most women, there are two “peaks of acne” — one during adolescence and another at perimenopause and menopause, according to the doctor. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There are many women who have been clear of acne for 20 years, and then, starting at around 40-ish, they start to break out again,” she said. “And this time it’s centered around their lower face, chin and jawline, which is where hormonal acne tends to occur.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Menopause brings unexpected skin changes like acne, even for women who haven’t had it since their teens. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;deniskomarov – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Women often come to see me, at age 35 to 55, complaining about wrinkles and pimples — and they feel too young for their wrinkles and too old for their pimples,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While men who have a genetic predisposition for acne may continue to break out into older adulthood, for women, “there’s a particular hormonal component from the late 30s through the early 50s, around perimenopause and menopause.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The breakouts usually stop when menopause is finished, Wechsler said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some studies have suggested that taking GLP-1 weight loss and diabetes medications could increase acne prevalence, but others have not identified a link.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I see patients all day long who are taking GLP-1s, so I would imagine if there were a link, I probably would have picked up on something by now,” Wechsler said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatments for adult acne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The main remedy for aging-related acne is taking &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/shopping/best-acne-skincare-products-review/"&gt;hormone-related medications.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;Spironolactone is specifically for hormonal acne in women,” Wechsler said. “It blocks testosterone from binding to the testosterone receptors in the lower face.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Going on hormone replacement therapy or a birth control pill can also help with acne, she noted, but treatments will vary based on each person’s situation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Some people come in with just small blackheads and whiteheads, and they might not need something oral,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dr. Amy Wechsler, a Manhattan dermatologist, notes acne peaks in adolescence and again during perimenopause. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Fox News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Treatments range from hormone meds like Spironolactone to topical retinoids and lifestyle changes. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jana Kollarova – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s when we might prescribe something topical, often a retinoid with the brand names of Differin, Retin-A or Tretinoin. Those are often very helpful for smaller pimples. Also, they’re anti-aging, which is nice. They grow collagen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wechsler said she sometimes prescribes a low dose of doxycycline, an antibiotic that also works as an anti-inflammatory. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If the acne is different or covering more of the face or the upper face, sometimes we’ll try a low dose of Accutane,” she added. “It really depends on the individual and how bad the acne is.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proactive defense&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While genetics and hormones can contribute to acne, stress can also affect the skin, the doctor said. One of the best ways to address this is to get optimal sleep, which is the “anti-inflammatory” time when the body heals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, many Americans don’t get enough sleep,” Wechsler said. “Adults need seven-and-a-half to eight hours. That’s when the stress molecule, cortisol, is at its lowest, and when all the healing molecules, like beta-endorphins and growth hormones and oxytocin, are at their highest.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to sleep, the doctor recommends looking for ways to lower cortisol levels during the day to help reduce stress levels — such as exercising, getting fresh air, connecting with friends, and doing stretching or deep breathing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For people who are acne-prone, Wechsler also emphasized the importance of choosing &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/03/health/acne-fighting-serum-infects-bacteria-that-causes-acne-with-a-virus/"&gt;the right skincare &lt;/a&gt;products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s really important that all products are non-comedogenic, or oil-free,” she recommended. “That means the company has tested the product and that it will not clog your pores and cause pimples.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to wash your face after exercising and at the end of the day, and to never go to sleep in makeup, the doctor advised. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those who are bothered by acne and have not seen results after two months of taking over-the-counter products, Wechsler recommends seeing a dermatologist for help.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, exactly what you eat and when should be tailored to your routine. Here are their recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How to approach breakfast if...&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;You’re an early riser&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Kinross’s advice is simple: if you wake at 6am naturally, try to eat between 6.30 and 7.30am – and definitely before 8am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope mostly agrees: if you’re trying to stay full with a long day ahead, “it can be helpful to wait for about an hour, maybe an hour and a half” before you eat, to keep you going until lunch and make sure you’ve fully digested last night’s meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;You struggle with mornings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should you not feel alert when you wake up, it’s tempting to reach for a big mug of coffee to help you get out the door, but Hope advises against this as doing so “can cause a big spike of cortisol, making you feel much more stressed”. Eating first slows the release of caffeine into your system, helping you to feel alert for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar is best avoided entirely. If you wake up groggy, a savoury breakfast will make sure you don’t crash later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;You wake up ravenous&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Well done – it means you’ve likely fasted correctly and your circadian rhythm is in sync with your gut,” Dr Kinross says. Just bear in mind Hope’s advice that breakfast should make up about a fifth of your daily calorie intake, to leave room for two more square meals and some healthy snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aim to eat by satisfying your hunger without spiking your glucose,” Dr Kinross says, as “despite the urge to eat everything in sight, you need stable energy throughout the day”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;You don’t feel hungry until the afternoon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you consume any food, your body releases the hormone insulin to tackle it. The release of insulin can affect the release of other hormones in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So even if you don’t feel hungry, it’s best to eat something, even if small, particularly if you’re a woman, as “having something to eat soon after you wake is crucial to keeping the hormonal system stable”, Hope says. A handful of nuts and a few berries will do. “Never eat anything that comes in a bar form and don’t believe anyone who tells you that you can drink your breakfast,” adds Dr Kinross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;You exercise before work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re planning to do cardiovascular exercise early in the morning, it’s wise to eat something relatively light but high in carbohydrates before you do, to fuel your body.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to managing cholesterol, the foods you eat can play a significant role in your overall heart health. But there’s one protein that stands out as a true cholesterol-lowering powerhouse, and that’s the humble &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069681/benefits-of-walnuts/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;walnut&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, one study involving older participants with healthy cholesterol levels at the start found that eating 1 to 2 ounces of these tasty nuts daily for two years lowered both total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol by an additional 4%.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But why is it so important to maintain healthy &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7877576/what-you-need-to-know-about-your-cholesterol-levels/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; levels in the first place? “High levels of [harmful] LDL cholesterol can lead to plaque buildup in the arteries, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke,” says &lt;a href="https://www.wendybazilian.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Wendy Bazilian, Dr.P.H., M.A., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Conversely, “HDL, [the] so called ‘good’ cholesterol, helps clear excess cholesterol from the bloodstream. I liken it to the garbage trucks circulating around and bringing it back for disposal, breakdown [and] elimination from the body.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To better understand why walnuts are such a standout in the fight against high cholesterol, we spoke with Bazilian and registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.samanthadevitonutrition.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Samantha DeVito, M.S., RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, for their expert take on why this nutrient-packed food is the best protein to lower cholesterol. Read on to learn what makes walnuts uniquely suited for heart health and how incorporating them into your diet may lower your cholesterol numbers.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For decades, studies have shown that nuts—including walnuts—may promote healthy cholesterol levels. It all started in 1993, says Bazilian, when a landmark study from Loma Linda University put nuts, and walnuts in particular, on the map, highlighting their nutritional attributes.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Since that time, literally hundreds of studies have expanded and confirmed a wide variety of health benefits of nuts,” she says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, what makes walnuts such a noteworthy addition to a cholesterol-lowering diet? As it turns out, it’s not one or two nutrients, says Bazilian. It’s their entire nutritional package. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are some unique ways these nutrient-packed nuts can improve cholesterol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Heart-Healthy Plant-Based Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One ounce of walnuts (about 14 walnut halves) provides 4 grams of protein.&lt;span data-cite="11" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That might not sound like much, but research has found that eating more &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-protein-benefits-11712145" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;protein from plants&lt;/a&gt; (like walnuts) may significantly lower the risk of developing heart disease.&lt;span data-cite="12" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One reason may be that plant proteins tend to be lower in cholesterol-raising saturated fat. Even though these nuts contain a fair amount of total fat (roughly 19 grams per ounce), only 2 grams of that is saturated fat, making them a great choice if you’re watching your cholesterol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Surprising Source of Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you think of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, nuts may not be the first food that comes to mind. However, with 2 grams of fiber per ounce (about 14 walnut halves), walnuts are a tasty way to add more roughage to your diet.&lt;span data-cite="11" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And that can help with cholesterol management and reduction, says Brazilian. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Studies have linked walnut consumption to a significant reduction in total and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/hdl-vs-ldl-cholesterol-whats-the-difference-11678853" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;. And their fiber may be one reason.&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; How, exactly, does fiber do this? “The fiber in walnuts helps reduce cholesterol levels by binding to cholesterol in the digestive system and aiding in its excretion,” says DeVito. “This in turn, reduces the amount of cholesterol that is absorbed into the bloodstream.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Healthy Unsaturated Fats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Walnuts are packed with not one but two types of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7595261/whats-the-difference-between-saturated-fat-and-unsaturated-fat/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;unsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt;. The first is a fat called linoleic acid. This polyunsaturated fat plays a critical role in lipid metabolism by helping remove LDL cholesterol from the body.&lt;span data-cite="13" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If that weren’t enough, walnuts are an excellent source of heart-healthy alpha-linolenic acid (ALA).&lt;span data-cite="6" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This plant-based &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;omega-3 fat&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to favorably regulate LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.&lt;span data-cite="7" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Packed with Antioxidants  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These tasty nuts are rich in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/polyphenols-reduce-cognitive-decline-11680121" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;polyphenols&lt;/a&gt;—beneficial plant compounds linked to better heart health—which may help explain why eating walnuts is linked to healthier cholesterol levels.&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Polyphenols are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2051586/best-antioxidant-rich-foods/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; that work to neutralize harmful free radicals, reducing oxidative stress that can damage cells and tissues.

&lt;ol id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add them to breakfast. &lt;/strong&gt;To start your day with a fiber and antioxidant kick, sprinkle a handful of chopped walnuts over oatmeal, yogurt or whole-grain cereal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swap them in for breadcrumbs. &lt;/strong&gt;Toss walnuts in a food processor and use them as you would breadcrumbs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pump up your salad.&lt;/strong&gt; Enhance your salads by adding toasted walnuts for an additional layer of flavor and nutrition.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Thanks to their exceptional nutrient profile, walnuts stand out as one of the best proteins to lower cholesterol. Their heart-healthy plant protein, fiber, omega-3 fats and antioxidants work to lower unfavorable LDL cholesterol while boosting helpful HDL cholesterol. Plus, they’re naturally low in cholesterol-raising saturated fat. If that weren’t enough, they also help support healthy gut bacteria, which have also been linked to healthier cholesterol levels.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you like to eat them as a snack, toss them into salads and cereal or use them as a meat substitute, they’re a deliciously versatile way to lower your cholesterol and improve your heart health. So go ahead and grab a handful of walnuts. Your heart will thank you—and your taste buds might just throw a little party, too!&lt;br&gt;

But it isn’t. It’s a condition where excess fat builds up in the liver, and over time, it can mess up one of the hardest-working organs in your body. What’s worrying is how fast it’s spreading in India, and how little we talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decade or two ago, fatty liver was mostly linked to heavy drinking. That’s changed. Today, the bigger driver is lifestyle. Long work hours, sitting too much, food that’s quick but not great, and stress that never really switches off. And yes, alcohol still plays a role, but a large chunk of cases now fall under non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Fatty liver: What are the symptoms, risk factors? How to manage it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fatty liver disease, now officially termed Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease or MASLD, occurs when fat accumulates in more than 5% of liver cells in the absence of significant alcohol consumption," says Dr. Gagandeep Singh, MBBS, Founder – Redial Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;India is seeing a strange mix right now. On one hand, rising incomes and urban living. On the other, less physical movement and diets packed with refined carbs, sugar, and ultra-processed snacks. So even people who don’t “look unhealthy” can have fatty liver. Thin outside, fat inside, as doctors sometimes say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The condition has reached epidemic proportions in India. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta-analyses estimate that approximately one in three Indian adults now has fatty liver, a pooled prevalence of around 38.6%. In urban populations and high-risk groups such as those with diabetes or obesity, this figure exceeds 50%," says Dr Gagandeep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So why don’t we hear about it more?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is that fatty liver is sneaky. In the early stages, it usually doesn’t hurt. No pain, no obvious symptoms, nothing dramatic enough to send someone to a doctor. Maybe some tiredness, a bit of discomfort. Easy to ignore. And because routine health checkups in India don’t always include liver imaging, many cases slip through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also a mindset issue. Liver disease, for many people, still equals alcohol. So if someone doesn’t drink much, they assume their liver must be fine. Doctors do try to explain otherwise, but public awareness campaigns haven’t really caught up yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there’s stigma. Talking about liver problems can feel awkward, like it automatically puts you in the “bad habits” box. So people avoid the conversation altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to clear confusion around fatty liver, Dr Gagandeep has answered a few common queries around the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why do many people with fatty liver have no symptoms at all?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Gagandeep Singh:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The liver is remarkably stoic. It has no pain receptors within its tissue, and it possesses extraordinary functional reserve, you can lose significant liver function before any symptoms appear. This is precisely what makes fatty liver so dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early stages, simple steatosis, the liver compensates. Patients feel entirely normal. There's no pain, no jaundice, no obvious warning signs. Even standard liver enzymes like ALT and AST can remain within normal ranges despite substantial fat accumulation. Studies show that liver enzymes may be normal in a significant proportion of individuals even when there is considerable hepatic fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time symptoms emerge, fatigue, right upper abdominal discomfort, unexplained weight loss, the disease has often progressed to inflammation (steatohepatitis) or even early fibrosis. The liver has been silently accumulating damage for years, sometimes decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why I tell patients: the absence of symptoms is not the absence of disease. Fatty liver is diagnosed by looking, not by feeling. Without proactive screening in at-risk individuals, we're catching this condition far too late in its natural history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who is most at risk for fatty liver disease, even if they don't drink alcohol?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Gagandeep Singh: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obvious candidates are individuals with obesity, Type 2 diabetes, or metabolic syndrome. But here's what catches many patients and even physicians off-guard: lean individuals can absolutely develop fatty liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research consistently shows that fatty liver occurs in individuals who are not obese, particularly in Asian populations. In India, studies have found that a substantial proportion of NAFLD patients have BMI below 25. The critical driver isn't total body weight, it's where the fat accumulates. Visceral adiposity, fat around the organs, matters far more than subcutaneous fat. An individual with a normal BMI but increased waist circumference and insulin resistance is at significant risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond metabolic factors, consider these high-risk groups: individuals with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), those with a family history of diabetes or fatty liver, people with sleep apnoea, and those with sedentary occupations. The IT sector workforce deserves special mention, recent research from Hyderabad found alarming MAFLD prevalence among IT employees, driven by prolonged sitting, irregular meal patterns, and high stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age matters too, risk increases with age, though we're now seeing fatty liver in children and young adults, particularly those with childhood obesity. If you have central obesity, insulin resistance, or prediabetes, you should be screened regardless of your overall weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who should be screened? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Gagandeep Singh: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with Type 2 diabetes, obesity (especially central obesity), metabolic syndrome, PCOS, or persistently elevated liver enzymes. I wouldalso recommend screening for individuals with a strong family history of diabetes or liver disease, those with sleep apnoea, and anyone with unexplained fatigue alongside metabolic risk factors. Given the high prevalence in India, a case can be made for screening all adults over 40 with even one metabolic risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What common diet habits silently worsen fatty liver?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Gagandeep Singh: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several dietary patterns drive hepatic fat accumulation, often without patients realising the connection:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juices: These are perhaps the single worst offenders. Fructose, whether from table sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, or "natural" fruit juices, is metabolised almost exclusively by the liver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refined carbohydrates: White rice, maida-based products, processed snacks, these spike insulin levels repeatedly throughout the day, promoting fat storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods: Beyond their refined carbohydrate content, these contain emulsifiers, preservatives, and industrial seed oils that may disrupt gut barrier function and promote inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sedentary lifestyle: This worsens body composition with more visceral fat and less muscle mass, and subsequently deranging overall metabolic profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inadequate protein: Without sufficient protein (I recommend 25-30 grams per meal), the body cannot maintain muscle mass. Sarcopenia, muscle loss, actually worsens fatty liver by reducing the body's capacity to handle glucose and triglycerides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="91"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are liver detox drinks and supplements actually helpful or harmful?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Gagandeep Singh: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me be direct: liver detox products are, at best, a waste of money. At worst, they can cause the very liver damage they claim to prevent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The liver doesn't need external "detoxification". It processes toxins, medications, and metabolic waste continuously, 24 hours a day. The concept that toxins "accumulate" in the liver and require special juices or supplements to flush out has no proof in biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="98"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Johns Hopkins hepatologists, there are no clinical data supporting the efficacy of liver cleanses. More concerning, dietary supplements are increasingly recognised as a cause of drug-induced liver injury. Research from the Acute Liver Failure Study Group found that herbal-dietary supplements accounted for 16% of severe drug-induced liver injury cases requiring hospitalisation (&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1542356525009425" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;DOI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="103"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific concerns include green tea extract in concentrated supplement form (associated with hepatotoxicity at high doses), turmeric supplements containing piperine (case reports of significant liver injury exist — &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/405932-drug-induced-liver-injury-secondary-to-turmeric-supplement-containing-piperine-a-case-report" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;DOI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;), and various proprietary "liver cleanse" formulations with undisclosed ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="107"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to support your liver, skip the supplements and focus on what actually works: dietary modification, exercise, weight management, and alcohol moderation. Your liver doesn't need a detox, it needs you to stop overwhelming it with excess calories and processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="111"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="112"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the top lifestyle changes you recommend to protect liver health?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Gagandeep Singh: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;I approach liver health through what I call coordinated metabolic rehabilitation — addressing root causes rather than symptoms. Here are the interventions with the strongest evidence:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="115"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="116"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Time-restricted eating: After twelve years of practising intermittent fasting myself and implementing it with hundreds of patients, I've found that 14-16 hour fasting windows improve insulin sensitivity more reliably than calorie counting alone. During fasting, insulin levels drop, allowing the liver to shift from fat storage to fat oxidation. The key is consistency — pick an eating window that fits your lifestyle and maintain it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Body recomposition, not just weight loss: I've stopped telling patients to simply "lose weight." The goal is losing fat while preserving or building muscle. Crash diets that sacrifice muscle for quick weight loss actually worsen long-term metabolic health. A 10-15% reduction in body weight, achieved gradually with adequate protein intake, produces more durable improvements than aggressive restriction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Resistance training: This is non-negotiable. According to PubMed research, resistance training is effective in reducing risk factors for metabolic syndrome and fatty liver by optimizing muscle and liver function (&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-88361-3_26" data-type="tilCustomLink" target="_blank"&gt;DOI&lt;/a&gt;). Aim for two to three sessions weekly, focusing on major muscle groups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein prioritisation: Every meal should contain adequate protein — 25-30 grams. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eliminate sugar-sweetened beverages: Replace sodas, packaged juices, and sweetened chai with water, black coffee, or unsweetened tea.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coordinated care: A physician adjusting medications and monitoring progress, a nutritionist customising meal plans within cultural preferences, and a fitness professional building sustainable exercise habits, this triangle of care succeeds where isolated dietary advice fails. Patients aren't lacking motivation; they're lacking a system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="117"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence is clear: fatty liver is not a life sentence. With early intervention and sustained lifestyle modification, reversal is achievable for many patients. But reversal requires action — and that action needs to start before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="121"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Medical experts consulted &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="123"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="124"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="125"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article includes expert inputs shared with TOI Health by: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="127"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gagandeep Singh, MBBS, Founder – Redial Clinic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="129"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inputs were used to explain why fatty liver is not being talked about enough despite being a silently growing crisis in India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>根除天花的领导者William Foege博士去世- ABC新闻</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/dr-william-foege-leader-smallpox-eradication-dies-129543666</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;&lt;span class="oyrPY qlwaB AGxeB  "&gt;ATLANTA -- &lt;/span&gt;Dr. William Foege, a leader of one of humanity's greatest public health victories — the global eradication of smallpox — has died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Foege died Saturday in Atlanta at the age of 89, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.taskforce.org/bill-foege-tribute/"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the Task Force for Global Health, which he co-founded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The 6-foot-7 inch Foege literally stood out in the field of public health. A whip-smart medical doctor with a calm demeanor, he had a canny knack for beating back infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He was director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and later held other key leadership roles in campaigns against international health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;But his greatest achievement came before all that, with his work on smallpox, one of the most lethal diseases in human history. For centuries, it killed about one-third of the people it infected and left most survivors with deep scars on their faces from the pus-filled lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Smallpox vaccination campaigns were well established by the time Foege was a young doctor. Indeed, it was no longer seen in the United States. But infections were still occurring elsewhere, and efforts to stamp them out were stalling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Working as a medical missionary in Nigeria in the 1960s, Foege and his colleagues developed a "ring containment" strategy, in which a smallpox outbreak was contained by identifying each smallpox case and vaccinating everyone who the patients might come into contact with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The method relied heavily on quick detective work and was born out of necessity. There simply wasn't enough vaccine available to immunize everyone, Foege wrote in "House on Fire," his 2011 book about the smallpox eradication effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;It worked, and became pivotal in helping rid the world of smallpox for good. The last naturally occurring case was seen in Somalia in 1977. In 1980, the World Health Organization declared smallpox eradicated from the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"If you look at the simple metric of who has saved the most lives, he is right up there with the pantheon. Smallpox eradication has prevented hundreds of millions of deaths," said former CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden, who consulted with Foege regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Foege was born March 12, 1936. His father was a Lutheran minister, but he became interested in medicine at 13 while working at a drugstore in Colville, Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He got his medical degree from the University of Washington in 1961 and a master's in public health from Harvard in 1965.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He was director of the Atlanta-based CDC from 1977 to 1983, then held other international public health leadership roles, including stints as executive director at The Carter Center and senior fellow at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In 2012, President Barack Obama presented Foege with the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. In 2016, while awarding Foege an honorary degree, Duke University President President Richard Brodhead called him "the Father of Global Health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“Bill Foege had an unflagging commitment to improving the health of people across the world, through powerful, purpose-driven coalitions applying the best science available,” Task Force for Global Health CEO Dr. Patrick O’Carroll said in a statement.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrffriy000x26p77v68f0xs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday released its updated recommendations for what vaccines children should get. It’s a routine revision, hardly different from last year’s recommendations, but it carries more significance this year: More states and doctors are relying on it instead of a controversial new schedule from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrpy4bv00033b6s31z7ozt1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The AAP’s newest recommendations include a new immunization against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and a few other minor adjustments — a stark difference from the sweeping changes abruptly made to the CDC vaccine schedule this month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmksq9pwd00013b6sp58ql1sw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the CDC schedule has long been the default guide to vaccination across the country, many doctors say they’re now choosing the AAP’s guidelines instead.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r70006336po0aq7tw5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The science hasn’t changed,” said Dr. Claudia Hoyen, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and director of pediatric innovation at UH Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland. “We will continue to follow the science.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r70003336pd2qqmt53@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The AAP continues to broadly recommend routine immunization against RSV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rotavirus, flu and meningococcal disease. Twelve major medical and health care organizations have formally endorsed its recommendations, including the American Medical Association, the National Medical Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkst331000043b6swrnvdk62@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In contrast, the updated CDC schedule narrowed recommendations for protection against meningococcal disease, hepatitis B and hepatitis A to children who are at higher risk for infections. It also recommends that choices on vaccinations against flu, Covid-19 and rotavirus be based on “shared clinical decision-making,” which means people who want one must consult with a health care provider.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkslzh9l00003b6s6nq03rvw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “After an exhaustive review of the evidence, we are aligning the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule with international consensus while strengthening transparency and informed consent,” US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said after the vaccine schedule update. “This decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrgx0330003336pq4kt2xtr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There were no safety issues or new research to suggest that the vaccines on the CDC’s previous schedule weren’t necessary.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r70004336pwfwo7g2x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For now, unfortunately, we have to ignore everything about vaccines that is coming from our federal government,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary, chair of the AAP’s Committee on Infectious Diseases. “Parents should trust their pediatrician, trust the professional societies like the American Academy of Pediatrics.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r70005336pku0unz2c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The half-dozen pediatricians who spoke with CNN they said they’ll stick with the AAP’s guidance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r70007336p1l18yxtr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Sarah Elizabeth DeRoo, a pediatrician at Children’s National in Washington, DC, says that she will continue to share “very candidly” with families about vaccines and that “we know they’re safe and effective.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmksvg0fn000b3b6sm35p9dwi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the CDC’s vaccine schedule changed this month, she said, it undermined some parents’ confidence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r70008336p76t2jpzt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have families that come into our clinic that traditionally have been very accepting of vaccines and they want to know, ‘is this new recommendation, is this evidence-based, or do I need to think differently about these vaccines’ that they’ve accepted previously?” DeRoo said. “We’ve been giving messaging to our patients that we’re continuing to follow the recommended schedule by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which is an evidence- based schedule.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The disconnect between advice from the CDC and from doctors has confused and even scared some parents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r70002336pj5zbjyga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are seeing the vaccine conversation come up more and more frequently because of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;fear of this and general misinformation spreading online,” said Dr. Nina Alfieri, Continuity Clinic director with Lurie Children’s Pediatrics at Uptown in Chicago. “We always want families to feel welcome coming to clinic with their questions.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r70009336p6xgky1u9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at NYU, said he gets why parents are asking more questions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmksv4zcv00053b6sgnhd6yrb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ve had so many years of the CDC being a reliable source of information,” he said. “It’s understandable why families are confused.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r7000a336phoe299i5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Historically, states have followed CDC recommendations, but most say they will now follow AAP recommendations instead, &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/state-health-policy-data/state-recommendations-for-routine-childhood-vaccines-increasing-departure-from-federal-guidelines/" target="_blank"&gt;according to KFF&lt;/a&gt;, a health policy organization.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r7000b336p9inc8k93@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As of January 20, KFF found, 28 states were giving advice that deviates from federal guidelines for some or all childhood vaccines. Although it’s not clear how states will handle vaccine requirements for schools, what is clear is that there is a real blue/red divide on which vaccine advice to follow, according to Jen Kates, a co-author of the analysis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r7000c336prcu8ic9f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All states with Democratic governors have announced that they won’t follow federal guidelines. Only four states led by Republicans have done the same.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r7000d336phnzmyi44@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For the first time in our country, we’re going to have really varying laws, policies and attitudes about vaccines based on where people live,” Kates said. “It’s a major sea change in public health policy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r7000e336p8ops78zy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hoyen&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; of UH Rainbow Babies and Children’s, has been practicing medicine for 30 years and said she doesn’t want to go back to the pre-vaccine days. She remembers a colleague&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;who was deaf in one ear because of a childhood case of mumps and another in the same class who was deaf in one ear because of meningitis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmksv7ut000073b6saolln0i0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Meningitis was so common before the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine came into use in 1987, she remembers, that pediatricians routinely kept spinal tap equipment on hand.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r7000f336p5xbeqzs5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’d do the taps in the office, give them a dose of penicillin or whatever and send them straight to the hospital,” Hoyen said. “There’s a reason why these vaccines were created. It’s to help kids thrive and not to have to worry about complications from these childhood illnesses.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r7000g336pcgyyhilg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            O’Leary also doesn’t want to go back to the pre-vaccine era. He trained to be a doctor in the 1990s, before there was a vaccine against rotavirus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmksvae9f00093b6s9ub0ul28@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We had three seasons. In the winter, we had influenza season, we had RSV season, and we had rotavirus season. Heaven forbid if they all hit at the same time, because we’d be overwhelmed. Now, we don’t have a rotavirus season, and we’re seeing a very big impact on RSV season with the new product,” O’Leary said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r7000h336pdv9s6b5c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            DeRoo, who has only been caring for children during what she called “the vaccine era,” says she’s been trying to refresh her knowledge of what vaccine-preventable diseases look like.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkstb4lj000c3b6s72fb2fl4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have to rethink how we’re approaching people who walk in and are sick in the clinic, to make sure that we take all the appropriate precautions in the event that they may not be fully immunized,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r7000i336p36h6kzak@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ratner said a measles outbreak in New York a few years ago was the first time many of his colleagues had ever seen a case.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkstbn7b000e3b6ss4msiw9e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think, given the way that things are going in this country, that is likely to change,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkrfg1r7000j336p1qe5s2w1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The idea of going backwards is horrifying because you don’t want to lose hard-won progress, but also because we’re not talking about something abstract,” Ratner said. “We’re talking about actual children and families.”
    &lt;/p&gt;
