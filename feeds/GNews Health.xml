The position of those crystals affects the passage of light through the lenses. A built-in eye-tracker allows the glasses to respond to whatever correction the wearer needs at a given moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, tech-laden eyewear &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-30830265" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;has a troubled history&lt;/a&gt; – take Google's ill-fated "Glass" smart glasses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Consumer acceptability is key, acknowledges Mr Eiden.

And myopia, or short-sightedness, &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce8g4xpjz65o" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;is also on the rise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Spectacles have remained largely the same for decades. Bifocal lenses – in which a lens is split into two regions, usually for either near- or far-sightedness – require the wearer to direct their vision through the relevant region, depending on what they want to look at, in order to see clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Varifocals do a similar job but the transitions are much smoother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In contrast, auto-focus lenses promise to adjust part or all of the lens spontaneously, and even accommodate the wearer's changing eyesight over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The first lenses that we produced were horrible," admits Mr Eiden, candidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Those early prototypes were "hazy", he says, and with the lens quality noticeably poor at its edges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But newer versions have proved promising in tests, says Mr Eiden. Participants in the company's trials have been asked, for example, to read something on a page, then look at an object in the distance, to see whether the glasses respond smoothly to the transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Mr Eiden says that the eye tracking device within the spectacles cannot determine exactly what a wearer is looking at, though certain activities such as reading are in principle detectable because of the nature of eye movements associated with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Since such glasses respond so closely to the wearer's eye behaviour, it's important the frames fit well, says Emilia Helin, product director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;IXI's frames are adjustable but not to a great degree, given the delicate electronics inside, she explains: "We have some flexibility but not full flexibility." That's why IXI hopes to ensure that the small range of frames it has designed would suit a wide variety of faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The small battery secreted inside IXI's autofocus frames should last for two days, says Mr Eiden, adding that it's possible to recharge the specs overnight while the wearer is asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But he won't be drawn on a launch date, which he intends to reveal later this year. As for cost, I ask whether £1,000 might be the sort of price tag he has in mind. He merely says, "I'm smiling when you say it but I won't confirm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250701-150711-e3d94715db-web-2.24.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7b76/live/251892a0-414d-11f0-bace-e1270fc31f5e.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7b76/live/251892a0-414d-11f0-bace-e1270fc31f5e.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7b76/live/251892a0-414d-11f0-bace-e1270fc31f5e.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7b76/live/251892a0-414d-11f0-bace-e1270fc31f5e.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7b76/live/251892a0-414d-11f0-bace-e1270fc31f5e.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7b76/live/251892a0-414d-11f0-bace-e1270fc31f5e.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7b76/live/251892a0-414d-11f0-bace-e1270fc31f5e.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7b76/live/251892a0-414d-11f0-bace-e1270fc31f5e.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images A mother tries on glasses in a store with her young daughter" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Autofocus lenses could help people who struggle with varifocals or bifocals&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Autofocus lenses could help people who struggle with varifocals or bifocals, says Paramdeep Bilkhu, clinical adviser at the College of Optometrists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, he adds, "There is insufficient evidence to state whether they perform as well as traditional options and whether they can be used for safety critical tasks such as driving."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Chi-Ho To, an optometry researcher, at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University has a similar concern – what if the vision correction went wrong or was delayed slightly while he was, say, performing surgery on someone?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"But I think in terms of general use having something that allows autofocusing is a good idea," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Mr Eiden notes that the first version of his company's lenses will not alter the entire lens area. "One can always glance over the dynamic area," he says. If wholly self-adjusting lenses emerge then safety will become "a much more serious business", he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In 2013, UK firm Adlens released glasses that allowed wearers to manually change the optical power of the lenses via a small dial on the frames. These lenses contained a fluid-filled membrane, which when compressed in response to dial adjustments would alter its curvature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Adlens' current chief executive Rob Stevens says the specs sold for $1,250 (£920) in the US and were "well received by consumers" but not so much by opticians, which he says "strangled sales".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Since then, technology has moved on and the concept of lenses that refocus themselves automatically, without manual interventions, has emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Like IXI and other companies, Adlens is working on glasses that do this. However, Mr Stevens declines to confirm a launch date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Joshua Silver, an Oxford University physicist, founded Adlens but no longer works for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He came up with the idea of fluid-filled adjustable lenses back in 1985 and developed glasses that could be tuned to the wearer's needs and then permanently set to that prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Such lenses have enabled roughly 100,000 people in 20 countries to  access vision correcting technology.

          &lt;p&gt;A 57-year-old woman spent six days in the hospital for severe liver damage after taking daily megadoses of the popular herbal supplement, turmeric, which she had seen touted on social media, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/liver-damage-turmeric-supplement-woman-hospitalized-rcna217578"&gt;according to NBC News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman, Katie Mohan, told the outlet that she had seen a doctor on Instagram suggesting it was useful against inflammation and joint pain. So, she began taking turmeric capsules at a dose of 2,250 mg per day. According to the World Health Organization, an acceptable daily dose is &lt;a href="https://apps.who.int/food-additives-contaminants-jecfa-database/Home/Chemical/638"&gt;up to 3 mg&lt;/a&gt; per kilogram of weight per day—for a 150-pound (68 kg) adult, that would be about 204 mg per day. Mohan was taking more than 10 times that amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, she developed stomach pain, nausea, fatigue, and dark urine. "I just did not feel well generally," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After seeing a news report about the possibility of toxicity from turmeric, she connected her symptoms to the pills and went to urgent care. Blood tests revealed her liver enzyme levels were 60 times higher than the normal limit, suggesting liver damage. She was admitted to a local hospital and then transferred to NYU Langone in New York City. Her hepatologist there, Nikolaos Pyrsopoulos, said she was "one step before full liver damage, liver failure, requiring liver transplant."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rare toxicity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, turmeric—a golden-colored staple of curries—is not harmful, particularly in foods. But, as herbal supplements have gained popularity and doses have gotten larger, doctors have reported &lt;a href="https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(22)00740-9/fulltext"&gt;a rise in liver injuries from the spice&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, while rare overall, turmeric appears to have become the most common herbal cause of liver injuries in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We're constantly told to "eat healthy" – but what does that actually mean?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even doctors sometimes struggle to offer clear, practical advice on which specific foods support health, why they work and what real benefits people can expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing body of research is starting to offer some answers. Along with colleagues, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40126033/"&gt;I have researched&lt;/a&gt; whether a group of plant compounds called flavan-3-ols could help lower blood pressure and improve blood vessel function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/news/new-study-finds-tea-and-chocolate-may-help-lower-blood-pressure"&gt;The results suggest&lt;/a&gt; these everyday compounds may have real potential for protecting heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-secret-to-better-sleep-could-be-as-simple-as-eating-more-fruit-and-veggies?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;The Secret to Better Sleep Could Be As Simple As Eating More Fruit And Veggies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flavan-3-ols – sometimes called flavanols or catechins – are natural plant compounds that belong to the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5465813/"&gt;flavonoid family&lt;/a&gt;. They're part of what gives plants their colour and helps protect them from sunlight and pests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For us, they show up in some of our most familiar foods: cocoa, green and black tea, grapes, apples and even some berries. That slightly tart or bitter note you taste in dark chocolate or strong tea? That's flavan-3-ols at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long been interested in their health effects. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35294962/"&gt;In 2022, the Cosmos trial&lt;/a&gt; (Cocoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study), which followed over 21,000 people, found that cocoa flavanols, but not multivitamin supplements, reduced deaths from cardiovascular disease by 27%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study set out to dig even deeper, focusing specifically on their effects on blood pressure and endothelial function (how well blood vessels dilate and respond to blood flow).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analysed data from 145 randomised controlled trials involving more than 5,200 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies tested a range of flavan-3-ol-rich foods and supplements, including cocoa, tea, grapes, apples and isolated compounds like epicatechin, and measured their effects on two key cardiovascular markers: blood pressure and flow-mediated dilation (FMD): a measure of how well the inner lining of blood vessels functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies ranged from short-term (a single dose) to longer-term interventions lasting weeks or months. On average, participants consumed about 586 mg of flavan-3-ols daily; roughly the amount found in two to three cups of tea, one to two servings of dark chocolate, two tablespoons of cocoa powder, or a couple of apples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular consumption of flavan-3-ols led to an average drop in office blood pressure of 2.8 mmHg systolic (the top number) and 2.0 mmHg diastolic (the bottom number).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for people who started with elevated blood pressure or diagnosed hypertension, the benefits were even greater with reductions of up to 6–7 mmHg systolic and 4 mmHg diastolic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's comparable to the effects of some prescription blood pressure medications and could significantly lower the risk of heart attacks &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/eight-ways-to-reduce-your-stroke-risk-no-matter-what-age-you-are-251524"&gt;and strokes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also found that flavan-3-ols improved endothelial function, with an average 1.7% increase in FMD after sustained intake. This benefit appeared even in participants whose blood pressure was already normal, suggesting these compounds may help protect blood vessels through multiple pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side effects were uncommon and typically mild, usually limited to minor digestive issues, suggesting that adding flavan-3-ol-rich foods to your diet is generally safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Supporting cardiovascular health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the benefits were most pronounced in those with high blood pressure, even people with normal readings saw improvements in vascular function. This suggests flavan-3-ols may help prevent cardiovascular problems before they begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure is one of the major drivers of heart disease worldwide, even at levels that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10243231/"&gt;don't qualify as full-blown hypertension&lt;/a&gt; (140/90 mmHg or higher). &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.072696#:%7E:text=The%202024%20European%20Society%20of,treat%20depends%20on%20the%20underlying"&gt;Recent guidelines&lt;/a&gt; from the European Society of Cardiology now recognise that even "elevated" blood pressure (120–139 systolic and 70–89 diastolic) carries increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle changes, particularly diet and exercise, are recommended by doctors as first-line strategies. But patients and even healthcare providers often lack clear, specific guidance on which foods truly make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings help fill this gap by showing that boosting flavan-3-ol intake through everyday foods may offer a simple, evidence-based way to support cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167409" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167409" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/TeaBerriesChocolate.png" alt="Tea in a cup next to berries and chocolate" class="size-full wp-image-167409" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/TeaBerriesChocolate.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/TeaBerriesChocolate-415x415.png 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/TeaBerriesChocolate-600x600.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167409" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eating certain foods could help support your heart health. &lt;/span&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/elegant-tea-setting-with-strawberries-and-chocolates-31583807/"&gt;İclâl Ağlamaz/Pexels&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What about supplements?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies tested supplements or isolated flavan-3-ol compounds, but these generally showed smaller effects than whole foods like tea or cocoa. This may be because other beneficial compounds in whole foods work together, enhancing absorption and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, it appears both safer and more effective to focus on getting flavan-3-ols from foods rather than high-dose supplements, especially for people taking medications, since interactions are not fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies we reviewed suggest that 500–600 mg of flavan-3-ols daily may be enough to see benefits. You could reach this by combining two to three cups of green or black tea, one to two servings (about 56g) of dark chocolate or two to three tablespoons of cocoa powder, two to three apples, plus other flavan-3-ol-rich fruits like grapes, pears and berries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small daily swaps, then, like trading a sugary snack for an apple and a piece of dark chocolate or adding an extra cup of tea, could gradually improve your heart health over time. Because flavan-3-ol content can vary between foods, monitoring your blood pressure at home may help you see if it's making a difference for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed, particularly in people with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="167407" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, where the results were less consistent. We also need to better understand how flavan-3-ols interact with medications and whether even greater benefits can be achieved when combined with other healthy habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the evidence is now strong enough to recommend flavan-3-ol-rich foods as part of a heart-healthy diet. As clinicians seek practical, affordable lifestyle strategies for patients, these findings bring us closer to the idea of using food as medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, flavan-3-ols aren't a magic fix. They won't replace medication for everyone. But combined with other healthy habits, they may offer a meaningful – and delicious – boost to cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And unlike many health fads, this isn't about exotic superfoods or expensive powders. It's about foods many of us already enjoy, used a little more intentionally.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256631/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Lol. I went years without any desire at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Mine has improved greatly, and it was good before," added another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Speaking&lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.wsj.com/health/wellness/weight-loss-drugs-ozempic-wegovy-side-effects-sex-0210c42b?st=es7rd6zzgxu9f2p&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink"&gt; to &lt;/a&gt;The Wall Street Journal, Dr. James Simon, a reproductive endocrinologist, OBGYN and clinical professor at George Washington University, explained that the impact of GLP-1 mediations on sex drive may come down to biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Some Ozempic users have reported a loss in libido (Getty Stock Photo)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;He said: “These drugs do work in the same places that pleasure and sexual interest are located in the human brain—male and female."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr. Taylor Kohn, a fellow in male reproductive medicine and surgery in the Department of Urology at Baylor College of Medicine, also told the publication that in the long run, the cardiovascular benefits associated with weight loss would likely have a positive impact on anyone experiencing erectile dysfunction, saying: “We know that if you reverse cardiovascular disease, erectile dysfunction improves as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;When contacted for comment, Novo Nordisk, which manufactures Ozempic, told UNILAD: "Patient safety is of the utmost importance to Novo Nordisk, and we recommend patients take these medications for their approved indications and under the supervision of a healthcare professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"We continuously collect safety data on our marketed GLP-1 medicines and work closely with the authorities to ensure patient safety.

When patients at her clinic in midtown Manhattan bring her information from AI chatbots, it isn’t necessarily incorrect, but what the LLM suggests may not be the best approach for a patient’s specific case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;For instance, when considering IVF, couples will receive grades for viability for their embryos. But asking ChatGPT to provide recommendations on next steps based on those scores alone doesn’t take into consideration other important factors, Knopman says. “It’s not just about the grade: There’s other things that go into it”—such as when the embryo was biopsied, the state of the patient’s uterine lining, and whether they have had success in the past with fertility. In addition to her years of training and medical education, Knopman says she has “taken care of thousands and thousands of women.” This, she says, gives her real-world insights on what next steps to pursue that an LLM lacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Other patients will come in certain of how they want an embryo transfer done, based on a response they received from AI, Knopman says. However, while the method they’ve been suggested may be common, other courses of action may be more appropriate for the specific patient’s circumstances, she says. “There’s the science, which we study, and we learn how to do, but then there’s the art of why one treatment modality or protocol is better for a patient than another,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Some of the companies behind these AI chatbots have been building tools to address concerns about the medical information dispensed. OpenAI, the parent company of ChatGPT, &lt;a data-offer-url="https://openai.com/index/healthbench/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://openai.com/index/healthbench/"}' href="https://openai.com/index/healthbench/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; on May 12 it was launching HealthBench, a system designed to measure AI’s capabilities in responding to health questions. OpenAI says the program was built with the help of more than 260 physicians in 60 countries, and includes 5,000 simulated health conversations between users and AI models, with a scoring guide designed by doctors to evaluate the responses. The company says that it found that with earlier versions of its AI models, doctors could improve upon the responses generated by the chatbot, but claims the latest models, available as of April 2025, such as GPT-4.1, were as good as or better than the human doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Our findings show that large language models have improved significantly over time and already outperform experts in writing responses to examples tested in our benchmark,” Open AI says on its website. “Yet even the most advanced systems still have substantial room for improvement, particularly in seeking necessary context for underspecified queries and worst-case reliability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Other companies are building health-specific tools that are specifically designed for medical professionals to use. Microsoft says it has &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-medical-superintelligence-diagnosis/"&gt;created a new AI system&lt;/a&gt;—called MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator (MAI-DxO)—that in testing diagnosed patients four times as accurately as human doctors. The system works by querying several leading large language models—including OpenAI’s GPT, Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, Meta’s Llama, and xAI’s Grok—in a way that loosely mimics multiple human experts working together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;New doctors will need to learn how to both use these AI tools as well as counsel patients who use them, says Bernard S. Chang, dean of medical education at Harvard Medical School. That’s why his university was one of the first to offer students &lt;a href="https://cmecatalog.hms.harvard.edu/ai-clinical-medicine"&gt;classes&lt;/a&gt; on how to use the technology in their practices. “It’s one of the most exciting things that’s happening right now in medical education,” Chang says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The situation reminds Chang of when people started turning to the internet for medical information 20 years ago. Patients would come to him and say, “I hope you’re not one of those doctors that uses Google.” But as the search engine became ubiquitous, he wanted to reply to these patients: “You wouldn’t want to go to a doctor who didn’t.” He sees the same thing now happening with AI. “What kind of doctor is practicing at the forefront of medicine and doesn’t use this powerful tool?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2025 10:46:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxPd2l5NTVXYUx5dGZ1a2o1NFN1amVMWmNJSFk4UFppcW9pQzNoRE8xSGM0dThLNVZWNUw0SG40T0xBNnZCcGhOMktnRDJjVGF1TzFadk9zM3hqTHhHeHd2RVdtYXpJUjV0LVltRllNN3VKeWI1TklfaFg0dVJjbzdpT0MzQ3UzR014NE9FRDRzNW1BSW1BZGY0UW81S2RRSnIzTVRfMDRZSzJ6cjFUNlE</guid></item><item><title>世界贸易组织（ WTOP ）医学博士表示，缩口带的趋势带来了严重的健康风险 | Mouth taping trend poses serious health risks, says Md. doctor - WTOP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPRWMtUDBqWFNVdTJtZnZrM0RUb0w3c0ktTE5yWTM2SktWQnhSeGd1T2RhVC1zMnRoYTNVckNtcjJQZ2MwY2ZaN05ha1lqNi16UDNnUmtLU2xzLTN4MlJqRWpySnhtcTlkVG13QXdGakUxM0I3bmlYTEE3T3BWNDdwZUJ3V0dibzdObGRNTUYwNnhLYW1TTzN0OWZ1NHJOUFBRdkRJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="schema-summary"&gt;Mouth taping trend to improve sleep quality, athletic performance poses serious health risks, says Maryland doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;The social media trend of mouth taping to improve sleep quality and ultimately boost athletic performance is largely unproven, and potentially dangerous, says Dr. Jennifer Gourdin, a sports medicine physician with Kaiser Permanente in Silver Spring, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mouth taping is when you put a piece of tape across your lips to encourage nose breathing when you’re sleeping,” Gourdin told WTOP. “It’s currently trending on Instagram and TikTok, claiming to improve sleep quality, oxygen levels and reduce snoring.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gourdin, whose handle on Instagram and TikTok is @drjthesportsdoc, said many of those engaging in mouth taping are athletes. “This is a big deal in the sports field, because improved sleep quality is associated with improved muscle recovery and improved athletic performance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory behind it is that nose breathing during sleep is more efficient, Gourdin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you breathe through your nose, you filter the air. It’s humidified and warm, so you’re less likely to wake up in the middle of the night with dry mouth or bad breath, and you’re less likely to wake up fatigued,” she said. “However, there’s not any strong evidence currently to suggest that this true.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, the practice of mouth taping poses several risks to many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you have something like sleep apnea or some other underlying sleep condition, if you have nasal congestion, a deviated septum, or allergy symptoms, taping your mouth could lead to more restricted breathing,” said Gourdin. “It could also lead to dangerous drops in your oxygen levels while you’re sleeping, and in some individuals, it can also lead to panic attacks or anxiety attacks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0323643" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;May study in the PLOS One journal,&lt;/a&gt; which reviewed 10 studies on mouth taping, found “very minor improvement in certain outcomes” for people with mild sleep apnea. But the research also found that “there are potential serious detrimental health outcomes to those with nasal obstruction,” who use oral taping as a means to ameliorate their mouth breathing, sleep apnea or sleep-disordered breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gourdin said there are currently no FDA-approved mouth tapes that are safe for people to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of resorting to mouth taping, to improve sleep quality, Gourdin suggests trying a cool, calm, dark environment, limiting screen time, and turning of the television and putting your phone away before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Have a sleep routine that you go through every night to help you wind down. Limit your intake of caffeine or alcohol before bed. And, for some patients, sleeping on your side can help improve your breathing,” Gourdin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="wp-block-group has-octonary-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In A Nutshell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lab studies found that psilocin, the active form of psilocybin, extended the lifespan of human fibroblast cells by up to 57% while preserving telomere length.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Aged mice given monthly doses of psilocybin showed a 60% better survival rate than untreated mice, with signs of improved fur quality.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The study suggests psilocybin may slow aging at the cellular level by boosting SIRT1, reducing oxidative stress, and preserving DNA stability.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Experts caution that these findings are preliminary and must be tested in humans to confirm safety and benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ATLANTA —&lt;/strong&gt; Magic mushrooms could be the unexpected fountain of youth. A groundbreaking study reveals that psilocybin, the mind-altering compound found in these fungi, might do more than produce psychedelic experiences. The research suggests it could actually help people live longer lives. Researchers have discovered this controversial substance extends cellular lifespan and improves survival rates in aging mice, opening an entirely new frontier in anti-aging research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most research has focused on &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/psilocybin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;psilocybin’s ability&lt;/a&gt; to treat &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/psychedelic-magic-mushrooms-psilocybin-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/psychedelic-therapy-benefits-risks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and other &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/psychedelics-mental-health-mysical-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health conditions&lt;/a&gt;. But this study reveals the compound might be working at a much more fundamental level, literally slowing down the aging process itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There was overwhelming clinical evidence that it has benefits for multiple disease indications,” lead researcher Louise Hecker, PhD, tells StudyFinds. “But very little was known about how it affects the body outside the brain.” Our full Q&amp;amp;A with Dr. Hecker can be found at the end of our article.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-025-00244-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;npj Aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the research represents the first experimental evidence that psilocybin could function as a “geroprotective agent,” essentially a substance &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anti-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;that protects against aging&lt;/a&gt;. A drug already showing promise for treating mental illness might also help people maintain their health and vitality as they age.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hecker, a former associate professor of medicine at Emory University, and her team tested what they call the “psilocybin-telomere hypothesis.” This theory suggests that psilocybin’s remarkable ability to treat a wide range of conditions, from depression to neurodegenerative diseases, might stem from its effects &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/cutting-calories-slow-cell-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;on cellular aging&lt;/a&gt; rather than just brain chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-laboratory-cells-live-57-longer-with-psilocin-treatment"&gt;Laboratory Cells Live 57% Longer With Psilocin Treatment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team examined how &lt;em&gt;psilocin&lt;/em&gt;, the active form of psilocybin that forms when the body breaks down the original compound, affects human cells in laboratory conditions. Using human lung fibroblasts, which are cells that naturally age and stop dividing over time, scientists discovered something remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cells treated with psilocin lived significantly longer than untreated cells. At a moderate dose (10 μM), psilocin extended cellular lifespan by 29 percent. When researchers increased the dose to 100 μM, cells lived 57 percent longer than normal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers write that the psilocin-treated cells remained healthy and active for extended periods, continuing to divide and reproduce normally before eventually reaching the natural end of their lifespan. Importantly, the cells didn’t become &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancerous&lt;/a&gt; — they simply &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/intermittent-fasting-slow-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;aged more slowly.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mechanism behind this cellular age reversal involves several key biological processes. Psilocin increased levels of SIRT1, a protein crucial for regulating cellular aging, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/metabolism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, and stress responses. It also reduced &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/oxidative-stress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt;, the cellular damage caused by harmful molecules called free radicals. And it helped preserve &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/telomeres/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;telomeres&lt;/a&gt;, the protective caps on chromosomes that naturally shorten with age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Telomeres-1-1200x900.jpg" alt="Telomeres are found on both ends of chromosomes, 3d illustration." class="wp-image-130628" srcset="https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Telomeres-1-scaled.jpg 1200w, https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Telomeres-1-475x356.jpg 475w, https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Telomeres-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Telomeres-1-400x300.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Telomeres are “caps” found on both ends of chromosomes.

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aging-mice-show-60-better-survival-rates"&gt;Aging Mice Show 60% Better Survival Rates&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Laboratory cell studies can be promising, but the real test came when researchers moved to living animals. The team studied female mice that were 19 months old, roughly equivalent to humans in their &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/older-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;early to mid-60s&lt;/a&gt;. This age was deliberately chosen to test whether psilocybin could work as a realistic anti-aging intervention for older adults.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mice received either psilocybin or a placebo once per month for 10 months. The dosing strategy started with a lower amount (5 mg/kg) for the first treatment, followed by higher doses (15 mg/kg) for the remaining nine treatments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By the end of the study period, 80 percent of the psilocybin-treated mice were still alive, compared to only 50 percent of the control group. That represents a 60 percent improvement in survival rates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond just living longer, the psilocybin-treated mice &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/how-magic-mushrooms-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;appeared healthier&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers observed visible improvements in the animals’ fur quality, including new hair growth and less graying compared to the control group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-psilocybin-slows-aging-at-the-cellular-level"&gt;How Psilocybin Slows Aging at the Cellular Level&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How does a psychedelic compound manage to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;slow aging&lt;/a&gt;? The answer likely lies in psilocybin’s interaction with serotonin receptors, particularly the 5-HT2A receptor. These receptors are distributed throughout the body in various cell types including fibroblasts, neurons, heart cells, immune cells, and blood vessel cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When psilocybin activates these receptors, it appears to trigger an array of cellular changes that promote health and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/longer-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt;. The compound increases production of antioxidant enzymes that protect cells from damage, while simultaneously ramping up SIRT1 activity, a key player in cellular maintenance and repair.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This systemic approach might explain why psilocybin seems effective against such a wide range of conditions. Rather than targeting specific diseases, it may be addressing the underlying aging processes that make people more susceptible to illness in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-major-questions-remain-before-human-use"&gt;Major Questions Remain Before Human Use&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Significant questions remain before this research could translate to human applications. The mouse study used only female mice, so researchers don’t yet know whether &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anti-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the anti-aging effects&lt;/a&gt; apply equally to males. The optimal dosing schedule, age of treatment initiation, and long-term safety of repeated psilocybin use for aging also need further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Safety considerations are particularly important given that some research suggests delayed cellular aging could theoretically affect cancer risk, though the current study found no evidence of this problem. The researchers noted that treated cells eventually stopped dividing naturally rather than becoming cancerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/psilocybin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Psilocybin&lt;/a&gt; remains a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States, making research difficult and clinical use currently impossible outside of approved trials. The doses used in the mouse study were based on amounts given to humans in clinical trials for other conditions, but optimal anti-aging doses haven’t been established.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the research opens an entirely new avenue for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;aging research&lt;/a&gt; and potentially therapeutic intervention. The idea that a single compound could address multiple aspects of aging — from cellular health to oxidative stress to DNA protection — is certainly a change to the typical approaches that target individual age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Given the plethora of positive clinical outcomes already observed for &amp;gt;150 clinical trials, I am very confident that these findings can eventually be translated to humans,” says Hecker, who is now an associate professor at Baylor College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than waiting for people to develop specific conditions and then treating those diseases individually, psilocybin could potentially be used to slow the aging process itself. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/magic-mushrooms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Magic mushrooms&lt;/a&gt;, once relegated to counterculture experimentation, may hold keys to helping humanity live longer, healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; This article summarizes findings from an early-stage preclinical study. The results were obtained in laboratory cells and aged mice and have not yet been tested in humans. Psilocybin remains a controlled substance in many countries and is not approved for anti-aging use outside of regulated clinical trials&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studyfinds-q-amp-a-with-lead-researcher-louise-hecker"&gt;StudyFinds’ Q&amp;amp;A With Lead Researcher Louise Hecker&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What first sparked your team’s interest in testing psilocybin for aging rather than psychiatric conditions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LH:&lt;/strong&gt; My workout buddy kept asking me questions about psilocybin. Non-scientists always think scientists know everything about all things science. But I initially knew nothing about psilocybin. So I told him I would do some reading on pubmed – the only acceptable platform for scientists to find information. I was immediately blown away by what was known and also what was not known about psilocybin. There was overwhelming clinical evidence that it has benefits for multiple disease indications. But very little was known about how it affects the body outside the brain. One paper (based on an idea) stood out on the “psilocybin-telomere hypothesis” – which postulates that psilocybin interventions may quantifiably impact telomere length. I thought that this could offer a potential explanation for its efficacy across a wide range of clinical indications. This hypothesis is based on a large corpus of studies linking mental health biological aging markers: positive psychological states are associated with longer telomeres and negative psychological states are associated with shorter telomeres. But this “theory” had no scientific evidence to support it. I realized, I can actually test this!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the biggest surprise when you saw the cell lifespan results?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LH:&lt;/strong&gt; That psilocybin treatment led to such a dramatic impact on cellular life extension and increased survival in aged mice, even when administered late in life. Also that the mice “looked” healthier – that grew back hair and white hair grew back in black.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How confident are you that these effects might translate to humans?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LH:&lt;/strong&gt; Given the plethora of positive clinical outcomes already observed for &amp;gt;150 clinical trials, I am very confident that these findings can eventually be translated to humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could psilocybin’s impact on SIRT1 and oxidative stress explain its mental health benefits too?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LH:&lt;/strong&gt; Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think the telomere-preserving effects could have side effects, such as increased cancer risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LH:&lt;/strong&gt; This is certainly a risk and something that we need to carefully monitor moving forward. Additional studies are needed to evaluate this.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you respond to concerns about repeated psychedelic use in an aging population?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LH:&lt;/strong&gt; An effective anti-aging treatment that could be administered to adults during late life could have significant clinical potential. The dose utilized in mice was modeled based on a clinical trial in patients ranging from 29 and 70 years (three patients were &amp;gt;65 years), where no serious adverse events were reported at the study endpoint or the post-study follow-up (98 days)&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-025-00244-x#ref-CR24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; These findings support the feasibility of psilocybin treatment in older adults. Further, the FDA’s designation of psilocybin as a “breakthrough therapy” underscores its safety profile, as minimal adverse effects have been reported &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-025-00244-x#ref-CR25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-025-00244-x#ref-CR26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-025-00244-x#ref-CR27" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-025-00244-x#ref-CR28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. However, additional studies are warranted to identify optimized protocols for therapeutic efficacy, including the age of treatment initiation, frequency and dose of treatments, and to determine if treatment impacts maximal lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the biggest regulatory or funding barriers you face to moving this to a human trial?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LH:&lt;/strong&gt; The schedule I designation remains a significant barrier for research and subsequently clinical development. Further, this impacts funding. The overwhelming majority of psilocybin studies have been from private funding or foundations rather than federal funding. This unfortunately limits research progress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you wish the public would understand about the real state of psilocybin science?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LH: &lt;/strong&gt;That what we already know about psilocybin is quite amazing! But there is so much more that we do not understand about how it works and it’s potential. It will be important for the federal government to recognize the importance of such work to help propel research progress forward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anything else you’d like to add?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LH:&lt;/strong&gt; This is such an exciting finding, and we hope to share more of our findings with the public soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers conducted both laboratory cell studies and animal experiments to test psilocybin’s effects on aging. In cell studies, they treated human lung and skin fibroblasts with psilocin at various doses and measured how long the cells continued to divide before reaching senescence. For animal studies, they gave 19-month-old female mice either psilocybin or placebo once monthly for 10 months, starting with 5 mg/kg for the first dose and using 15 mg/kg for subsequent treatments. The researchers measured survival rates, observed physical changes, and analyzed various cellular markers of aging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Psilocin treatment extended cellular lifespan by 29% at moderate doses and 57% at higher doses in laboratory studies. The treated cells showed delayed senescence, increased SIRT1 levels, reduced oxidative stress, and preserved telomere length. In mice, psilocybin treatment resulted in 80% survival compared to 50% in the control group, along with visible improvements in fur quality and reduced graying. The effects appeared to work through serotonin receptor activation and involved multiple anti-aging pathways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study used only female mice, so sex-specific effects remain unknown. The research was exploratory in nature, and researchers were not blinded to treatment groups due to logistical constraints with handling a controlled substance. The optimal dosing schedule, treatment duration, and long-term safety of repeated psilocybin use for anti-aging purposes require further investigation. The study also didn’t measure maximum lifespan effects or determine the ideal age for treatment initiation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-funding-and-disclosures"&gt;Funding and Disclosures&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was supported by the Imagine, Innovate and Impact (I3) Award from Emory School of Medicine, the Georgia CTSA NIH award, a grant from the Emory Woodruff Health Sciences Center for Health in Aging, and Veterans Administration Health System funding. The authors declared no competing interests. Psilocybin and psilocin were obtained from Cayman Chemical under a DEA license.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-publication-information"&gt;Publication Information&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-025-00244-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;npj Aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, volume 11, article number 55, in 2025. The paper was titled “&lt;em&gt;Psilocybin treatment extends cellular lifespan and improves survival of aged mice&lt;/em&gt;” and was authored by Kosuke Kato, Jennifer M. Kleinhenz, Yoon-Joo Shin, Cristian Coarfa, Ali J. Zarrabi, and Louise Hecker from institutions including Emory University, Baylor College of Medicine, and the Atlanta VA Healthcare System.

She went to a doctor who told her she had a chest infection and treated her for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But when the treatment failed, she went to a clinic to get an HIV test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"By then I already assumed that I was HIV-positive, and I told the nurse this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She was right, and she has been on ARVs ever since. We're not using her real name at her request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She currently works as a project coordinator for an NGO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We help pregnant sex workers get their ARVs, to ensure their children are born HIV-negative.

In order to get serviced at these facilities, you have to arrive at 4 or 5am, and they may spend the whole day waiting for their medication. For sex workers, time is money," Gugu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She adds that she recently went to her local clinic with some friends to register her details and build a relationship with staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The nurse who attended to us was very rude. She told us there was nothing special about sex workers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She thinks this could lead to many sex workers defaulting on their medication, "especially because their hospital files contain a lot of personal information, and the concern is that sometimes the nurses at these local clinics aren't always the most sensitive in dealing with this kind of information."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;According to the UN, the US cuts to HIV funding could reverse some of the gains made by what has been called one of the most successful public health interventions in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Scientists in the UK-based &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01186-9/fulltext" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Lancet medical journal&lt;/a&gt; last month estimated that USAID funding directly reduced Aids deaths by 65%, or 25.5 million, over the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250701-150711-e3d94715db-web-2.24.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2175/live/d7846cc0-5cc8-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2175/live/d7846cc0-5cc8-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2175/live/d7846cc0-5cc8-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2175/live/d7846cc0-5cc8-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2175/live/d7846cc0-5cc8-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2175/live/d7846cc0-5cc8-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2175/live/d7846cc0-5cc8-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2175/live/d7846cc0-5cc8-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Standing at a podium, George W.

We were getting on top of some of these things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Gugu points out that treatment is a matter of life and death, especially for vulnerable populations like sex workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"People don't want to default on their ARVs. They're scared that they're going to die if they don't get access to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The cuts have also affected research aimed at finding an HIV vaccine and a cure for Aids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There's the long-term impact, which is that we're not going to be getting new vaccines for HIV," Prof Morris adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We're not going to be keeping on top of viruses that are circulating. Even with new viruses that might appear, we're not going to have the surveillance infrastructure that we once had."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;South Africa has been one of the global leaders in HIV research. Many of the medications that help prevent the virus, and which have benefitted people around the world, were trialled in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This includes Prep (pre-exposure prophylaxis), a medication which stops HIV-negative people from catching the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Another breakthrough preventive drug released this year, Lenacapavir, an injection taken twice a year and that offers total protection from HIV, was also tried in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;South African academic Prof Abdullah Ely is concerned that research will be affected by the US funding cut&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In a lab at Wits University's Health Sciences campus, a small group of scientists are still working on a vaccine for HIV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They are part of the Brilliant Consortium, a group of labs working across eight African countries to develop a vaccine for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We were developing a vaccine test to see how well that works, and then we would trial it on humans," Abdullah Ely, an Associate Professor at Wits University, tells the BBC in his lab. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The plan was to run the trials in Africa based on research carried out by Africans because we want that research to actually benefit our community as well as all mankind."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But the US funding cuts threw their work into doubt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"When the stop order came, it meant we had to stop everything. Only some of us have been able to get additional funding so we could continue our work. It's set us back months, probably could even be a year," Prof Ely says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The lab lacks funding to carry out clinical trials scheduled for later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"That is a very big loss to South Africa and the continent. It means that any potential research that comes out of Africa will have to be tested in Europe, or the US," Prof Ely says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In June, universities asked the government for a bailout of 4.6bn South African rand ($260m; £190m) over the next three years to cover some of the funding lost from the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We are pleading for support because South Africa is leading in HIV research, but it's not leading for itself. This has ramifications on the practice and policies of the entire globe," says Dr Phethiwe Matutu, head of Universities South Africa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;South Africa's Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi announced on Wednesday that some alternative funding for research had been secured. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust have agreed to donate 1m rand each with immediate effect, while the government would make available 400m rand over the next three years, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This would bring the total to 600m rand, way below the 4.6bn rand requested by researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As for Gugu, she had hoped that by the time she was elderly, a cure for HIV/Aids would have been found, but she is less optimistic now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I look after a nine-year-old. I want to live as long as I can to keep taking care of him," she tells the BBC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"This isn't just a problem for right now, we have to think about how it's going to affect the next generation of women and young people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;You may also be interested in:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dFZIgd"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250701-150711-e3d94715db-web-2.24.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images/BBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2025 04:19:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9wckIwZk1ZQjN0Ui1aUnQxZGtudVozMi1tUGpNS2x6Tk9WUElyU1lhX0lUY3l6R3dHOGQ3SkpmMmVELUtVRkhXMHFoNWZUQWNPWGJpQ3BCNG5BQdIBX0FVX3lxTE1IQW9FMTgwMF9ZRTg0dDRpeDFuSjhnQ2JVTzE3bExKdzZtQ1IyQW9hMldSbXR5aUVIa3VXSzAxVGRVNHhDNFVwRFd4UF9vZ09hU3ZIRHplX2ZubS1vV0Nv</guid></item><item><title>主要研究将4种健康饮食与高达28%的痴呆风险降低联系起来- ScienceAlert | Major Study Links 4 Healthy Diets With Up to 28% Lower Dementia Risk - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOTjRDc1MyY2ZJVEFuOEhBenVQczhoMFN5MDJjMWdzOHhwQ3ItX3c0Mk1wRjRUVEh1dkNNXy05YTBMeEtURXVkb3YxbjRLWnNtQ1BieEZSRGRNZ0FQQlhCV2FCRlNvVC1vSmVuLVJoOHo0aXFneWtsWWZIZ1hmT2tvWmZIQ2V6WkpGeUkzUlNHVGoxUXF0Y1MwNUJWUFk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Sticking to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_diet"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, rich in plants and nuts and low in meat, could drastically reduce your risk of dementia, according to a new study from researchers at Yonsei University in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific studies have long shown how our eating habits can affect &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/decades-long-study-links-red-meat-to-up-to-13-higher-dementia-risk"&gt;our chances of developing dementia&lt;/a&gt;. Backing up those previous findings, the new study digs into this association for four specific types of diet across a large sample size, following up with participants for an average of 13.5 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it's not enough to prove direct cause and effect between these diets and dementia risk, this study does show a strong association. Further down the line, that might help us understand how &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-isnt-the-only-form-of-dementia-an-expert-explains-the-differences"&gt;different types of dementia&lt;/a&gt; get started, and what steps we could take to slow or prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Considering the lack of a definitive cure for dementia, dietary interventions targeting specific food components, overall diet quality, and inflammatory potential offer promising approaches for early prevention," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnha.2025.100564"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-say-this-one-particular-diet-may-slow-the-decline-of-the-brain?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Scientists Say This One Particular Diet May Slow The Decline of The Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at 131,209 individuals aged between 40 and 69 in a public health database, scoring their diets against the Mediterranean diet (MEDAS), the &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/what-to-know-about-mind-diet"&gt;Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay&lt;/a&gt; (MIND) diet, the Recommended Food Score (RFS), and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sticking to any of these four healthy diets was linked to a notable drop in dementia risk – between 21 and 28 percent. RFS adherents showed the best results, followed closely by the MIND diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inversely, participants' diets were also scored against another metric, the Energy-adjusted &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_inflammatory_index"&gt;Dietary Inflammatory Index&lt;/a&gt; (EDII). Higher EDII scores, which indicate pro-inflammatory diets, were linked to a 30 percent increase in dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167168" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167168" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/MediterraneanGraph.jpg" alt="Dementia risk graph" class="wp-image-167168 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/MediterraneanGraph.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/MediterraneanGraph-563x415.jpg 563w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/MediterraneanGraph-600x442.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167168" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The study mapped adherence to diets, including the Mediterranean diet (MEDAS), against the number of dementia cases over time. (Youn et al., &lt;em&gt;J Nutr. Health Aging&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The healthy diets all focus on whole grains, fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts, and poultry. Fried foods, dairy, and meat are discouraged. It's thought that this helps &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sticking-to-the-mind-diet-could-reduce-your-risk-of-developing-dementia"&gt;reduce stress inside the body&lt;/a&gt; and thus protect the brain from harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The associations between dietary patterns and dementia were stronger in older adults and women and varied between the obese and non-obese groups, highlighting the differential impact of dietary patterns across subgroups," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnha.2025.100564"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings underscore the potential of dietary interventions as modifiable factors to reduce the risk of dementia, particularly in vulnerable populations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite plenty of progress in our understanding of dementia in recent years, we're still not sure of its precise causes – though we know that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-nuts-linked-to-lower-risk-of-dementia-study-finds"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-risk-is-strongly-shaped-by-your-mothers-side-study-finds"&gt;genetics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/can-a-healthy-lifestyle-beat-alzheimers-like-documentary-claims"&gt;physical exercise&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-stage-of-sleep-seems-to-be-critical-for-reducing-risk-of-dementia"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; all play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-15-factors-are-linked-to-early-dementia-risk-a-major-study-found"&gt;so many factors&lt;/a&gt; involved, figuring out how conditions such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="167165" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease develop in some people and not others isn't easy. However, each of these studies helps put together a full picture, as well as suggesting practical ways in which we might help reduce our own personal risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study effectively addresses several limitations of previous studies on diet and dementia," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnha.2025.100564"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many earlier studies relied on a single dietary scoring system without comparing multiple dietary patterns, or had relatively short follow-up periods, limiting their ability to assess long-term effects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnha.2025.100564"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Nutrition, Health and Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Most people forget about it. But it is working every second, breaking down food, filtering toxins, regulating hormones and keeping your body in balance. It asks for little. But when ignored, it gives loud warnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Saurabh Sethi knows this well. Trained at AIIMS, Harvard and Stanford, the liver and gut specialist shared a striking thread online on July 9. No jargon. No fluff. Just nine hard truths. No-nonsense, easy-to-miss signs, everyday things people get wrong and how they push their liver into damage mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="v-zeenews-india-v1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what Dr. Sethi wants everyone to know before it is too late:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendingNow" class="mb-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Your Liver Can Regrow, But Not Forever&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it regenerates. But it is not made of magic. Scar tissue from chronic damage does not heal. Once it develops cirrhosis, its game is over for healthy function.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Coffee Is Medicine – No, Really&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three or more cups a day can slash the risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer by up to 40%. Skip the cream. Skip the sugar. But if caffeine makes you jittery or wrecks your sleep, go easy.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Fatty Liver Hits 1 In 3 Adults – Even Teetotalers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is exploding. And it does not scream. It sits silently, building damage over years. Many find out only when it is too late.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. The Liver Filters Every Pill You Pop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your painkillers go through it. So does your multivitamin. And too much acetaminophen (paracetamol) can be lethal. Always check your dosage.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Bad Sleep? Your Liver Suffers Too&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disrupted sleep interferes with detox and fat metabolism. Dr. Sethi advises 7-9 hours of sleep every night without any excuse as sleep is essential not only for your brain.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. The Liver Follows A Clock&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eat late and you mess with its rhythm. Your liver runs on a circadian cycle. Midnight snacking throws a wrench into its fat-clearing engine.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Your Home May Be A Liver War Zone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cleaning sprays. Air fresheners. Pesticides. Even that “organic” face cream. Dr. Sethi warns – your liver filters it all. Go natural whenever possible.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8. Supplements Can Hurt Too&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That Ayurvedic mix or high-dose vitamin might seem harmless. But many herbs trigger inflammation. Always check with your doctor, especially if you are already on meds.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9. Water Is Your Liver’s Best Friend&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two to three litres of plain and clean water everyday. It is not a wellness gimmick. It helps flush toxins. Your liver needs it. 

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/DL25dufsAdN/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final word:&lt;/strong&gt; The liver does not shout. It whispers. Then one day it crashes. Dr. Sethi’s warning is clear – fix your daily habits now or pay later.
