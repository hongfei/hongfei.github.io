Her numbers kept creeping up. Soon, the glucose levels in her blood officially tipped into the “prediabetic” zone. When Hyman was eventually diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, at age 48, she begged her doctors to give her six more months before prescribing medication. “I was frustrated with my body, and I wanted to do something myself,” she said. But her internist refused, saying Hyman’s uncontrolled blood sugar was too precarious; without medication, the damage to her body could be severe. “I was really upset,” Hyman said. “I just didn’t fit the profile of someone with Type 2 diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M4RG5BLPM5FC7DV4SQQZJFSCH4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;During this time, Hyman began noticing her inability to distinguish colors. She routinely asked her children whether clothes were blue or green. Her husband gently joked, “On your tombstone it’ll read, ‘What color is that?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HHAQRNP66JH2JPPFZK2PZKXZCI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Hyman figured it was time to discuss her diabetes and color-blindness with an ophthalmologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZYJ2GRBEOBHL3CIULXXU7DMM4Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That conversation marked the beginning of a medical odyssey and a scary diagnosis — a life-threatening disorder that few doctors have seen. It took a misdiagnosis and a handful of physicians to figure it out, and when they did, it was both terrifying and a relief for Hyman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FG2A2LXPDFBTJHW6CF3K57WJ4I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“A diagnosis for people is peace of mind, even if it’s a terrible thing,” said Hyman, who is now on an experimental treatment plan that may help. “Without it, I’d still be treated like I have Type 2 diabetes, which isn’t what I have.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="EBWA4E6IXJEFVFNTBDJZBPHDJI" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="EBWA4E6IXJEFVFNTBDJZBPHDJI" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Issues in pregnancy&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B7VC562LHBHNZI6V3C7UHSSMFY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Hyman, now 54, had never been diagnosed with any serious illness until she was pregnant with her first child, at age 31. Doctors discovered she had gestational diabetes, a condition that occurs during pregnancy, when hormones shift dramatically, and the body struggles to produce enough insulin to handle the increased blood sugar levels. After her baby was born, the condition resolved, as is often the case. The same thing happened during her second pregnancy. When Hyman was pregnant with her third child, doctors assumed she would develop gestational diabetes and ordered insulin injections to keep her blood sugar in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GVZQRLCU7ZFDXNCTAD3MLLKPBE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;People with gestational diabetes are at&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9016728/" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9016728/" target="_blank"&gt;higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing Type 2 diabetes, studies show. Indeed, after her third pregnancy, Hyman’s blood sugar remained high; her A1C, a measure of glucose in the blood over several months, entered the “prediabetic” zone and stayed there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HRGZ7IZSMRCYTD4CYFOPVDPO5E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For 10 years she remained vigilant, working to keep her weight steady at no more than 102 pounds on her 5-foot-2 frame. Then her blood sugar rose into “diabetic” territory; she seemed unable to control it through lifestyle alone. Eventually, she agreed to take Metformin, a standard medication for Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="65TBBU23AFCT7OKBZSWSHNKEWM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Hyman’s husband, Garrett, a sports and spine doctor specializing in physical medicine and rehabilitation, said he had been suspicious about the diagnosis. “I always thought Rachel’s diabetes didn’t make sense,” he said. “She was eating better than anyone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="J5AJDMZ2AFBC3BL4EMCK2BWVNY" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="J5AJDMZ2AFBC3BL4EMCK2BWVNY" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Middle-aged color-blindness&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2YEDE6A7NBHIXMFWXI4YVGX6GY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Hyman’s vision problems worsened gradually. She recalled “seeing colors differently than other people” when she was younger. But in her 40s, the deterioration became apparent. Once, she said, she complimented a friend on a pair of “good, off-white pants,” and the friend replied, “They’re green.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LLNWJQEY5FACJIT56DQX326FUE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That’s when she raised concerns with the ophthalmologist. An examination for color-blindness, the&lt;a href="https://www.color-blind-test.com/color-blind-tests/ishihara-test/ishihara-color-blind-test.html" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.color-blind-test.com/color-blind-tests/ishihara-test/ishihara-color-blind-test.html" target="_blank"&gt;Ishihara&lt;/a&gt; test, revealed she could not see numbers embedded in a color background that people with normal vision can easily spot. The doctor said she was “severely color deficient,” Hyman recalled. When she shared a memory of being able to see numbers on the same test taken years before, the ophthalmologist referred Hyman to a specialist, citing concerns about potential eye or brain disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MWT2HJKF3VFPREE6AWNZ4KQ724" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In March 2023, Hyman arrived at Swedish Hospital in Seattle for an appointment with Bonnie Keung, a neuro-ophthalmologist. After an exam, Hyman learned she had “pale optic nerves,” which indicate possible damage or an underlying condition affecting the nerves that connect the eyes to the brain. Healthy optic nerves are pinkish. Hyman’s were faded and partially white. Keung ordered genetic tests and an MRI to look for problems, like a mass in the brain. “I was scared they’d find something no one was looking for,” Hyman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="WZ6NJ7ESKVBC5CJJ534S3DFUFQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="WZ6NJ7ESKVBC5CJJ534S3DFUFQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;‘What I found looked awful’&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IIHPPMUCSNC5FNXQJK24GI3PNU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Hyman’s MRI was normal, but on viewing the genetic tests results, Keung was “truly surprised,” she recalled. “I thought she would have one of the more common inherited optic neuropathies we see. … [Hers] is a rare condition even in the world of neuro-ophthalmology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SG7PTDWD4ZB6TD7IUKBKI72UAE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Hyman tested positive for &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24044-wolfram-syndrome" target="_blank"&gt;Wolfram syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, an incurable genetic disorder that can affect blood sugar regulation, vision and neurological health. It affects approximately &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/wolfram-syndrome/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#frequency" target="_blank"&gt;1 in 500,000 people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide. In Wolfram’s classic form, patients face a bleak prognosis: childhood diabetes, optic nerve atrophy and then other debilitating symptoms, such as loss of bladder control, anxiety, depression and trouble swallowing and breathing. The median life expectancy is about 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JMLP3SDEJZFNHAOFQ7PUGXVHJE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When she received the diagnosis, Hyman immediately began googling. “What I found looked awful,” she said. “This was not good, and I was scared and confused.” She thought about a first cousin, also 54, with Type 1 diabetes who is legally blind. “I wondered, ‘Was that going to be me?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZCTV4EYNENDNJJPCPNXKT5ENOM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Hyman was so distressed by what she was reading that she mistook the word “morbidity,” which refers to the impact of an illness on a population, for “mortality,” the death rate. “I’m reading about this high mortality rate and freaking out and I show my husband, ‘Oh my God, look at this,’ and he says, ‘It’s morbidity, not mortality.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UN6BSHYBIRARXNPTZANU364OHE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Keung quickly arranged a telehealth meeting for Hyman with a Wolfram specialist. But the week leading up to the appointment was stressful: Hyman couldn’t concentrate and lost her appetite and her ability to enjoy activities. “You’re kind of holding your breath,” she said. “Who wants to be the person with the super rare condition? Who’s going to want to do anything to help; there’s probably no research and who knows what my future holds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="OHCB4F5CVFBZ5P56L6R5EMX34Q" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="OHCB4F5CVFBZ5P56L6R5EMX34Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;A milder variant?&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5ZHMNSLDFVGLZBZVYMPAT3BTGU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Anxious, Hyman logged on to that first meeting in August 2023 with Fumihiko Urano, a medical geneticist professor at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis who is director of the Wolfram Syndrome and Related Disorders Clinic at BJC HealthCare. The clinic is the only&lt;a href="https://wolframsyndrome.wustl.edu/" target="_blank"&gt; center&lt;/a&gt; in the United States studying and treating people with Wolfram syndrome, which is characterized by mutations in the WFS1 gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NOBDJXBRURCUNO6CRRW2GQB2U4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Urano delivered some reassuring news: It appeared Hyman had a milder variant of Wolfram that mainly affects Ashkenazi Jews, whose ancestors like hers, come from Eastern or Central Europe. Researchers only started to understand the variant fairly recently, said Urano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2EYMYF2YK5F5DLPH3AMUOD3HQA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Urano said that in 2015, he began noticing that a few of his Wolfram patients, who were Jewish, had milder, later-onset, less debilitating symptoms. Then, in 2018, he got a call from a Jewish genetic testing lab in Brooklyn asking about a specific mutation in the WFS1 gene that appeared among their diabetes patients. “Something clicked,” he said. “We all realized the same thing at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VJRWZSXBE5DP3H3X6FV747FKIQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Urano estimates that about 3 percent of Ashkenazi Jews are carriers for the variant. Both parents must be carriers for a child to have a 25 percent chance of developing Wolfram syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5TIUIU5NRVFVJGKP7SVOUHK3ZY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Hyman’s husband, Garrett, who was tested and is not a carrier, said it’s difficult not knowing the trajectory of his wife’s condition. Although her current symptoms, including blood sugar dysregulation, vision problems and bladder issues related to Wolfram, are manageable, it’s unclear whether these and her overall neurological health might worsen. “My worry is whether Rachel will struggle with more impairments over time that lead to disability,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GCR7OFUPARF37FG4SW6KFZGCFI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Today, to try to slow disease progression, Hyman takes supplements: tauroursodeoxycholic acid, or &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9675478/#:~:text=This%20evidence%20suggests%20that%20a,R558C%20(Figure%203A)." target="_blank"&gt;TUDCA&lt;/a&gt;, which has shown potential benefits in animal and human cell studies, and&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38428428/" target="_blank"&gt; idebenone&lt;/a&gt;, which targets mitochondrial function, another aspect of Wolfram’s, Urano said. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7547529/#:~:text=Chemical%20chaperones,thereby%20salvaging%20remaining%20tissue%20function." target="_blank"&gt;Clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; are underway evaluating possible&lt;a href="https://www.amylyx.com/news/amylyx-pharmaceuticals-announces-positive-long-term-results-from-phase-2-helios-clinical-trial-of-amx0035-in-people-with-wolfram-syndrome" target="_blank"&gt; treatments&lt;/a&gt;. Urano is trying to enroll 1,000 Ashkenazi Jewish patients for a trial to gain a more detailed clinical picture of the Wolfram variant that afflicts Hyman. But that has been challenging because few Ashkenazi Jews have even heard of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="L3OCKJLOXZG4XBTK2O2HAOKKOM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Right now, more rabbis know about Wolfram than endocrinologists,” said Irl Hirsch, an endocrinologist and professor at the University of Washington’s medical school in Seattle who is part of Hyman’s treatment team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HFXUMNPFP5H4ZNONV3IMO5XSZA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Hirsch prescribed the GLP-1 drug Ozempic, which is used to treat Type 2 diabetes, among other conditions, for Hyman; it’s been found to mitigate certain Wolfram-related symptoms in&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36995380/" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36995380/" target="_blank"&gt;preclinical findings&lt;/a&gt;, he said, and it has returned her to the prediabetic zone. This improvement probably occurred because Hyman lost a few pounds, and these drugs may support insulin production by beta cells in the pancreas, Hirsch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6SVUQO6BQNAYTFM6FOCZXUCVTQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Finally receiving the correct diagnosis motivated Hyman to urge family members to get tested. Her first cousin, who is blind, tested positive and is now taking experimental supplements.

Since tumors are typically slow to develop, it could take decades to know what that might have done to the locals’ cancer risk. But there may be a quicker route to an answer: The residents’ dogs were also exposed, and dogs develop cancer more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EMY2CFQIQRGXRF2N2E2IU5SU3Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Studying dogs and their cancers turns out to be an excellent way to learn more about cancer in people. And it’s not just that dogs and owners share exposures to many of the same environmental carcinogens. Researchers are also learning that cancers develop along remarkably similar pathways in the two species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KMTEV3THANFHLAGSKTEFVIPHRA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The faster pace at which canine cancers progress also means that researchers testing new therapies can get quicker results than with human clinical trials. This benefits scientists, dogs and their owners, proponents say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IIN7HWBN6NHIFG2C4YWO5ZJWMQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Man’s best friend is man’s best biomedical friend,” says &lt;a href="https://www.breenlab.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Matthew Breen&lt;/a&gt;, a geneticist at North Carolina State University. “It’s like having a mobile BioSentinel organism that can help inform us about our own medical prospects over the next 25 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="VEORCHFRTBAWVHIODP4BHF3COA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="VEORCHFRTBAWVHIODP4BHF3COA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Dogs in the vanguard&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CEXHBIDBDBHO7HLOEUFCIQLVOE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/health-disease/2022/inside-brains-aging-dogs" target="_blank"&gt;biomedical bond between people and dogs&lt;/a&gt; is not new. Veterinarians have long treated canine patients with drugs developed for use in people, and doctors have relied on dogs to test therapies and procedures before deploying them in the clinic. Techniques to treat the bone cancer osteosarcoma without amputating the patient’s limb, for example, were first developed in dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WH7MFVE5JFFF7H42C7V4BDHICM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Yet today this cross-fertilization is no longer an occasional benefit. Researchers are realizing that canine tumors parallel those in people so closely that dogs may be the best reference point for understanding many human cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2PC6XCQXBVGF7EMRSEH3GUEBMU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One of the most important similarities between canine and human cancers is that they arise after a protracted struggle at the cellular level. Over the years, cells accumulate genetic damage that disables normal controls on cell division, and emerging tumors evolve ways to evade the immune system. So there can be many different pathways to cancer that differ from tumor to tumor — and, it turns out, even from cell to cell within a single tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WY54X6FZRBFJBBGQQQTGROOL2Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Traditional lab-mouse approaches to studying cancer miss much of that heterogeneity, because the system is more artificial. Researchers typically have to implant tumors into inbred strains of mice whose immune systems have been suppressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OS7HL3BQDVGI7DCMANUX7AWTPQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But new genetic research underscores how similar the accumulating damage is in dogs and people. In a yet-to-be-published study, &lt;a href="https://karlssonlab.org/about/people-old/elinor-karlsson/" target="_blank"&gt;Elinor Karlsson&lt;/a&gt;, a genomicist at the UMass Chan Medical School, and colleagues looked at genes from more than 15,000 human tumors of 32 different types and more than 400 canine tumors of seven different types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BZTOO43KYVHWBFKXJBMP6TCZSE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The aim was to identify genetic mutations present in the cancers but not in normal cells of the same individual. Such mutations were presumably not inherited but probably represented genetic damage accumulated over a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XPAWKWOBUNBEPKEJ6B56ZWTAVA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That damage looked remarkably similar in the two species, Karlsson says. “Genetically, in terms of what’s driving cancers, it’s basically the same genes in dogs and humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7N4LPB2ZUFGMDICQANRKPWLA4U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Many of the dog tumors, for example, had mutations in genes already known to drive human cancers, such as the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, often mutated in breast and prostate cancers. Notably, mutations often occurred in or near the same locations in the genes in both species, suggesting that they may cause similar dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O2DQQ3HIERADTP27X57LBR2HBA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A similar recent finding came from researchers at &lt;a href="https://fidocure.com/" target="_blank"&gt;FidoCure&lt;/a&gt;, a California-based company where scientists are investigating how tumors with specific mutations respond to human therapies. Records of 1,108 dogs with cancer showed that dogs whose tumors carried particular mutations had &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41698-023-00346-3" target="_blank"&gt;higher survival rates&lt;/a&gt; if they were treated with a human drug specific to that mutation. This implies that the underlying biology of the cancers may be similar in the two species, and if so, researchers ought to be able to use dogs as a test bed to develop new therapies for people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RM53FZA6VZBKFAOLWLIYMKL3MA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That has already paid off in therapies first developed in dogs that are now in clinical trials or approved for use for people, says &lt;a href="https://irp.nih.gov/pi/amy-leblanc" target="_blank"&gt;Amy LeBlanc&lt;/a&gt;, a veterinary oncologist and director of the comparative oncology program at the National Cancer Institute. Examples include immunotherapies for brain cancers; viral therapy that targets lymphoma; and drug therapies against multiple myeloma, lymphoma and brain tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="2OFPLLPWENE4ZPC2ZNSO6L2RRM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="2OFPLLPWENE4ZPC2ZNSO6L2RRM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;A faster path to answers&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="INRHI2MGQRG3ZG5XFMEGKSAFMQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Because cancers progress faster in dogs, clinical trials yield results more quickly. For example, tumors often produce an unusual abundance of malformed RNA molecules. Researchers have shown, in mice, that targeting these molecules with a vaccine can delay or prevent the cancers. But testing a preventive vaccine in people wouldn’t yield results for many years, even decades — and funding agencies aren’t likely to support such a long and expensive study based solely on data from mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MZD7HOF3TJG7RGI4R7MMMLBODI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It would be an enormous leap to go from the mouse studies to some kind of gigantic, 15- or 20-year human cancer prevention study,” says &lt;a href="https://vetmedbiosci.colostate.edu/directory/member/?id=douglas-thamm-1053" target="_blank"&gt;Douglas Thamm&lt;/a&gt;, a veterinary oncologist at Colorado State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="F677M57MDRBL3IDT3AYTALMG4Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Instead, Thamm and his colleagues tested the vaccine in dogs, which shrinks the timeline to just five years. All the data — from 804 dogs — have now been collected, and the researchers are analyzing them, with results expected by the end of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZSHFC7LCXNFOZEVHQXOFZ2LT2Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Cancer detection techniques, too, can benefit from testing in dogs. Many golden retrievers, for example, will eventually develop a cancer of the blood vessels called hemangiosarcoma. Drugs can usually forestall the cancer’s progression, but many dogs will relapse. Karlsson and colleagues are studying whether they can detect that relapse in blood samples drawn from affected dogs, a technique known as liquid biopsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XBQSHYGAQJGPRGUB7IGU3YJLFI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The technique is still under development, but spotting early signs of relapse might allow veterinarians to abandon failing therapies and try something else more quickly, says project co-leader &lt;a href="https://facultyprofiles.tufts.edu/cheryl-london/about" target="_blank"&gt;Cheryl London&lt;/a&gt;, a veterinary medical oncologist and immunologist at Tufts University, who co-wrote a 2016 overview of the &lt;a href="http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/eprint/D6r8QgagpTNxXgy3TdYS/full/10.1146/annurev-animal-022114-110911" target="_blank"&gt;similarities between dog and human cancers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="QFRVTI6EBRBJPLJ6IKLGHRRTSU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="QFRVTI6EBRBJPLJ6IKLGHRRTSU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Environmental watchdogs&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="57CAHV5YCFARRH3Y3V5OIRH444" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There is another important way that dogs can benefit the study of cancer — as environmental sentinels. “Dogs live in our environment,” Breen says. “They breathe the same air, they drink the same water. The dog runs across the same herbicide-treated grass that our grandkids run over.” If those &lt;a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/health-disease/2019/exposome-research" target="_blank"&gt;exposures increase the risk&lt;/a&gt; of cancer in dogs, they are likely to do so in people, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T5TDMARZFNGEFKJXE3JRSCPQL4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In people, exposures to environmental carcinogens might take 25 years to produce full-blown cancers, Breen says. “But the accelerated lifespan of a dog means they may only need to be exposed to it for two or three years.” That makes testing dogs a quicker way to spot the chemicals that potentially pose the greatest danger to people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IFXT2VNOHNDD7G4M63BHPXXYCE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Breen and colleagues were interested in environmental toxins that might contribute to bladder cancer. The team knew that in dogs, genetic damage that accumulates in cells of the bladder wall often includes a mutation called BRAF V595E, an early marker for bladder cancer. To find out which chemicals were linked to that cancer, the team identified 25 dogs with the BRAF V595E mutation. Then they sent out specially designed silicone tags for the dogs. They also sent tags to 76 dogs (matched for breed, sex and age) that lacked the mutation. Each wore the silicone for five days, during which time it absorbed chemicals from the home environment. The owners then returned the tags to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IJTEAVBHWNANNL2B4VGCA54SGA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Analysis of the tags identified &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.4c09271" target="_blank"&gt;25 chemicals that were more abundant in the dogs&lt;/a&gt; with the mutation, and therefore carcinogen candidates. These included flame retardants, plasticizers and combustion by-products from smoking, fires and vehicle emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Z2RY4G2I3BFZTCCMD2A3XLYCDY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A similar approach may help to measure the cancer risk from other environmental exposures, such as the train derailment in East Palestine. To that end, Karlsson and colleagues recently mailed silicone tags to about 75 dog owners who live near the site. If dogs exposed to chemicals in that train derailment show a higher rate of cancer-related mutations in their blood, Karlsson says, their owners might need to be monitored for an increased risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VUPUCPTEZFD7TPSISZTJ35WEP4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers often reiterate the benefits of this research not just to science, but also to dog owners and their sick pets. The pets receive cancer care that their owners might not have access to otherwise, and the owners may get a little more time with their companions. “We’re not experimenting on these animals to their detriment,” Thamm says. “We’re trying to help those individuals.” That, he says, is a source of great satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O7K5QA4NUZHF3FCXJP22FZJHXI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This article was produced by &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Knowable magazine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, where a longer version of it ran.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2025 12:32:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9Zb3JUTnRpRVFtbldyTnZNNzdsLTFuaUJ0VVpVZ3FJT3ZBV2ZVdUNoeFdnOGtWNkw4NTBFcWY3dGxfUTdXZ0JsMHMyZUs2dzNyUU52U05Lc0I1ZHdCdWVXZ0REanJlZmotcXU3VWpuMDdiUW8xUkVN</guid></item><item><title>好莱坞明星在他的“睡房”中揭露虐待狂医生的虐待行为......因为他与中央情报局的秘密联系出现-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxPRkhZUEo2Ny1ROEs3TUxSVVNON01GOC1HUWVLLUxld1JVbVNPb2FLd1RacjZTRkozbEpFMFRNRE5UMVNSS2NMbHlqSHMwRWpmdVc1bmp1a2RJWDRpS0l5WXh3NFhibzA1UklJS0NTNUp4RGUxYm9aSndRVHpwa3FTejJKWDZjTjBwSFc2UWV2Yk5tZWJOZXRmYw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The darkened ward held just six patients - all young women, all fast asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The air was heavy with the funk of unwashed bodies, and filled with tortured whimpers.

She arrived for her treatment from New York, on a flight paid for by &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/jimi-hendrix/index.html" id="mol-3fcd3760-6d6a-11f0-b59b-ad678a14899f" class=""&gt;Jimi Hendrix&lt;/a&gt;, but by the time she left, she was unable to read, or make even the most basic decisions for herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Others came to Sargant with postpartum &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-66036c70-6d5a-11f0-b59b-ad678a14899f" class=""&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, anxiety or, in one case, were sent to the doctor for the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/crime/index.html" id="mol-726993f0-6d6d-11f0-b59b-ad678a14899f" class=""&gt;crime&lt;/a&gt; of dating a boy her parents disapproved of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their stories are told - many for the first time - in the&lt;span&gt; bombshell new book by Jon Stock, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.abramsbooks.com/product/sleep-room_9781419774478/"&gt;The Sleep Room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;: A Sadistic Psychiatrist and the Women Who Survived Him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And some are now asking if the sick experiments he conducted on their vulnerable young minds were funded and supported by the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr William Sargant was an enthusiastic fan of lobotomies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sargant's work was based on the firm belief that all psychiatric complaints could be cured with physical treatments such as deep sleep therapy or narcosis - and he was especially enthusiastic about lobotomies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was in his Sleep Room - &lt;span&gt;Ward 5 of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-5ad9d410-6d7d-11f0-b59b-ad678a14899f"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;'s Royal Waterloo hospital - &lt;/span&gt;that he tested those theories on his powerless patients nearly 60 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He would routinely subject them to a potent cocktail of antipsychotic, sedative and antidepressant drugs - often without their own or their parents' consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This treatment regimen, sometimes endured for months at a time, rendered them unconscious for more than 20 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were woken only to be washed, fed and tortured with repeated sessions of violent electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), before being drugged back to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most found their memories obliterated and emerged with little sense of who they were or why they'd been there. Many survivors feel the mental and physical scars of their abuse to this day - and some are convinced the doctor sexually assaulted them in their sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sargant still features in my nightmares,' actress &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-1372700/My-electric-shock-nightmare-hands-CIAs-evil-doctor-Calendar-Girls-star-Celia-Imrie.html"&gt;Celia Imrie&lt;/a&gt; says in the book. She describes him as a 'proud, incorrigible man with his hard, dark eyes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He had a face of thunder, like the devil,' she says, 'and had a horrible aura.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Imrie - star of Calendar Girls and the Bridget Jones franchise - was sent to Sargant suffering from an eating disorder at the age of 14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has few memories of her time there as she was heavily medicated throughout, but is haunted by the sight of a woman in the bed next to her being treated with ECT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I vividly recall every sight, sound and smell,' she says. 'The huge rubber plug jammed between her teeth; the strange, almost silent cry, like a sigh of pain, she made as her tormented body shuddered and jerked; the scent of burning hair and flesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Celia Imrie starred alongside Colin Firth in the Bridget Jones franchise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Imrie described Sargant as a 'proud, incorrigible man with his hard, dark eyes'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was a terrible thing for a 14-year-old to witness.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also describes the ghostly presence of the sleeping patients coming and going in the ward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I can picture it so clearly,' she says. 'And, although I saw many female patients come back to the ward from there, I never saw anyone emerge from the place awake. You went in asleep and you came out asleep, and you were totally unconscious while inside.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While she can't be sure she was personally treated with Sargant's 'sleep therapy,' she says, 'I must accept the very real possibility that I was.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recalls the insulin shock therapy, a now widely discredited and obsolete treatment that saw patients repeatedly injected with large doses of insulin to induce daily comas over several weeks. Sargant often used it, Imrie says, as 'a precursor' to his deep sleep therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And there was the terrifying threat of lobotomy should other treatments be deemed unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was in the air, talked about openly on the ward..&lt;span&gt;. For all I know, that might have been the next treatment for me,' Imrie says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sargant was known to perform illegal lobotomies and referred patients for them as late as 1977, by which time the medical profession had largely abandoned the barbaric procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Linda Keith, another of his patients, described herself as&lt;span&gt; 'a pleasure-seeking, music-obsessed drug addict,' when her parents turned to Sargant to 'cure' her wild ways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What they wanted was a tame, house-trained lapdog,' she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The model, who counted Rolling Stones guitarist &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-6491969/Keith-Richards-says-stopped-drinking-year-ago.html"&gt;Keith Richards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-8584421/Who-killed-Jimi-Hendrix-Fifty-years-musicians-death-PHILIP-NORMAN-tells-definitive-story.html"&gt;Jimi Hendrix&lt;/a&gt; among her loves, says that she can't remember being put to sleep in Ward 5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Linda Keith was 'a pleasure-seeking, music-obsessed drug addict' when her parents sought out Sargant to 'cure' her wild ways&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A top model, Keith dated Keith Richards, the Rolling Stones guitarist, who wrote the hit song Ruby Tuesday for her&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Keith says she didn't wake up for weeks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'All I know is that I didn't wake up for six weeks,' she says, recalling a room that was 'almost in complete darkness.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was eerie. Silence apart from the moan of sleeping patients, as many as eight of us crammed close together,' she continues. 'It was a twilight world and I have a tinge of fear even now as I force myself to think about it – the enormous amount of ECT that I was given.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time she emerged, she says she needed help to complete the simplest of tasks, such as getting dressed or deciding what to eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Most shockingly of all, I could no longer read,' she reveals. 'I recognized letters and words, but they made no sense to me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I wasn't happy or unhappy – I wasn't there. It was as if my brain and personality were dead.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While visiting Sargant as an outpatient she asked him when she might read again, but he claimed not to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'No one had had as much ECT as me, so he had no frame of reference,' she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I found this horrifying, but not as much as what happened next – he actually came on to me. Tried to hug me and kiss me on the mouth.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Keith wasn't the only one to accuse Sargant of sexual impropriety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One former patient, referred to only as 'Freya,' was 22 when she was first admitted to his care after experiencing a psychotic breakdown. She says she was held in the Sleep Room for nine months - three of which she was in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sargant began by giving me drug-induced narcosis, combined with ECT and insulin coma therapy. My family wasn't allowed to visit me for the first couple of months,' she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When my mum finally managed to come, she said afterwards that she'd looked at the chart at the bottom of my bed and saw that I'd received well over a hundred ECT treatments in two months – almost two a day.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her mother also later told her that Sargant had a habit of sending staff away for lunch and spending time with Freya alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I have no recollection of any conversations with Sargant while I was in bed,' she says, 'but I do remember asking the nurses a number of times during narcosis why my genital/pelvic area was very sore and painful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was only later, when I was made to go and see Sargant in Harley Street and he repeatedly attempted to take advantage of me, that I began to wonder whether those symptoms were due to abuse that he had perpetrated - and ensured I couldn't remember.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sargant's influence spread far beyond Britain. He was a regular lecturer in the United States, where he was a visiting professor at Duke University, and a trusted colleague of fellow physician Walter Freeman, another enthusiastic proponent of lobotomies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was Freeman who, assisted by Dr James Watts, performed the catastrophic prefrontal lobotomy on John F Kennedy's older sister, Rosemary, in November 1941.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The procedure left the 23-year-old &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/tvshowbiz/article-14886455/Carolyn-Bessette-Kennedy-JFK-Jr-snub.html"&gt;Kennedy &lt;/a&gt;sibling with the mental capacity of a two-year-old and she remained institutionalized until her death in 2005 at age 86.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sargant's influence spread far beyond Britain - he was a regular lecturer in the United States, where he was a visiting professor at Duke University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rosemary Kennedy was 23 when a frontal lobotomy left her with the mental capacity of a two-year-old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some former patients also question whether Sargant's influence in the US extended further - asking if their treatment was funded by the CIA as part of its investigation into methods of brainwashing and mind control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one classified report from October 1951, seen by the author, the British psychiatrist was singled out as someone who 'could be trusted by the US intelligence community to safely 'join forces' on a top-secret project to control and influence human behavior.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That project became the infamous &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14810277/CIA-plan-assassins-project-94-mkultra.html"&gt;MKUltra &lt;/a&gt;which was found to have dosed people with LSD without their knowledge in an attempt to reprogram their minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sargant's former patients tell Stock that MKUltra bore a striking resemblance to the treatment they endured - and allege that the Sleep Room might have been 'psychiatric experiment' funded bythe government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anne White, another of Sargant's patients, says, 'I was particularly shocked by the similarities between what the CIA had done to innocent members of the American public and the medical treatment that we'd been subjected to in the Sleep Room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Reading about MKUltra brought it all back to me: the drugs, the ECT, lying there on Ward 5 for days on end in a distressing, semi-awake state, deprived of all senses. To me the whole thing suddenly slotted together.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sargant died in 1988, but Keith still sometimes wonders what she'd say to him if she were to see him in again. Though, she says, it would likely be the same as what she uttered to his face years ago in a street encounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'He thought he was being very friendly and that I'd be thrilled to see him, but I called him a monster – to his face. I said it to the person walking past me too. 'This man is a monster.' And then I walked on.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;The Sleep Room: A Sadistic Psychiatrist and the Women Who Survived Him by Jon Stock is published by Abrams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2025 12:13:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxPRkhZUEo2Ny1ROEs3TUxSVVNON01GOC1HUWVLLUxld1JVbVNPb2FLd1RacjZTRkozbEpFMFRNRE5UMVNSS2NMbHlqSHMwRWpmdVc1bmp1a2RJWDRpS0l5WXh3NFhibzA1UklJS0NTNUp4RGUxYm9aSndRVHpwa3FTejJKWDZjTjBwSFc2UWV2Yk5tZWJOZXRmYw</guid></item><item><title>明尼苏达州的老年人比几乎任何其他州的老年人更有可能死于跌倒--《明星论坛报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizAFBVV95cUxPbm9LZHowNktsQ1Y1VTRCVlZtajBMdWZ3Y1hteDUtM0lBekhXa01ta19GWlo0RTJWd3dRWTVuRW1qMnlncXNTakduTVZsLXA5U1ZEdEJEM2tyVzBvYnlFMnhxNUtvT09RS0hOVVhldzZJS1JfM2tpQXlZc2d6Rnhzc1BVTjIxdllIeUE4QnIwV24xbTBuZUdUbEEyWmk3c1lXakFVdm5zdFJlMG0zQ3dnWVFvZXVTRDV1UWZtcmp2bTYySVFJTDU2LS12NVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="standard-in-line-image" class="rt-Box grid gap-2 col-span-full md:col-span-8"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Box font-utility-meta-reg-02 text-text-secondary col-span-full ArticleHero_leadart-standard-credit__Y1_wU"&gt;Group fitness instructor Kaye Benson leads a 55+ Fit For Life class July 29 at the Chanhassen Recreation Center.

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;metallic ring weighing over 1,100 pounds&lt;/strong&gt; crash-landed in Kenya just before New Year’s Eve, sending shockwaves—literal and figurative—through the small community of &lt;strong&gt;Mukuku&lt;/strong&gt;, about 115 kilometers southeast of Nairobi. Experts from the &lt;strong&gt;Kenya Space Agency (KSA)&lt;/strong&gt; later confirmed the object was a separation ring from a &lt;strong&gt;space launch vehicle&lt;/strong&gt;, raising urgent questions about the growing problem of space debris orbiting Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Terrifying Crash and a Community on Edge&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to eyewitness accounts gathered by the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyn9dgdwe3o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;BBC’s Waihiga Mwaura&lt;/a&gt;, residents first heard “a loud whizzing sound followed by a boom,” described by 75-year-old farmer Stephen Mangoka as “like a bomb going off.” The object, about &lt;strong&gt;8 feet (2.44 meters)&lt;/strong&gt; in diameter, landed on farmland near a dry riverbed and was red-hot for nearly two hours before villagers could approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Crowds gathered quickly, drawn by &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/03/nasas-curiosity-rover-makes-an-unprecedented-discovery-on-mars/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="83883" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;curiosity &lt;/a&gt;and fear, taking photos and speculating whether it was part of a rocket, a satellite, or something more sinister. Fearing scrap metal thieves might target the ring, villagers took turns guarding it overnight with local officials. By the next day, &lt;strong&gt;KSA teams&lt;/strong&gt; had secured the object and transported it for testing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter is-resized"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="" alt="A crowd, including police officers, stand behind yellow tape looking on at a giant metal ring which fell from space on to farmland in Mukuku, Kenya " data-lazy-src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/58aa/live/ed0ee1f0-cf7a-11ef-94cb-5f844ceb9e30.jpg.webp"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/58aa/live/ed0ee1f0-cf7a-11ef-94cb-5f844ceb9e30.jpg.webp" alt="A crowd, including police officers, stand behind yellow tape looking on at a giant metal ring which fell from space on to farmland in Mukuku, Kenya "&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A crowd, including police officers, stand behind yellow tape looking on at a giant metal ring which fell from space on to farmland in Mukuku, Kenya. Credit: Kenya Space Agency (KSA) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Is Space Debris Becoming More Dangerous?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Kenya Nuclear Regulatory Authority&lt;/strong&gt; confirmed the ring carried slightly elevated &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/chernobyls-dogs-are-evolving-at-a-record-speed/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="72602" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;radiation levels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, though “not at a level harmful to humans.” Still, the incident rattled locals, some of whom reported cracks in their homes and worried about future health risks. Others demanded compensation, pointing to the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/06/is-the-moon-the-next-billionaires-playground-a-trillion-dollars-worth-of-platinum-is-waiting/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="91685" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Outer Space Treaty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which makes the launching state legally liable for damage caused by its space objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Pinpointing responsibility, however, is tricky. KSA director general Brigadier Hillary Kipkosgey noted the ring was a “common item in many rockets” and said investigations were ongoing. The &lt;strong&gt;UK Space Agency&lt;/strong&gt; suggested it may belong to an &lt;strong&gt;Ariane rocket&lt;/strong&gt; launched in 2008. If so, the ring could have been silently orbiting Earth for more than 16 years before its fiery descent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Global Challenge Growing Harder to Ignore&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t an isolated event. NASA estimates over &lt;strong&gt;6,000 tons of space debris&lt;/strong&gt; currently orbit our planet, with more than&lt;strong&gt; 27,000 pieces&lt;/strong&gt; large enough to be tracked. Most of this material burns up on re-entry, but larger fragments can survive—and as the number of satellites and rockets in use climbs, so do the odds of impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similar incidents have already been recorded across Africa. In 2023, suspected space debris was found scattered across villages in western Uganda. Just days after the Mukuku crash, residents of northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia reported seeing bright objects streaking through the night sky. Each event underscores the growing unpredictability of orbital junk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why the World Needs to Act—Now&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts agree on one thing: the planet can’t afford to treat space as a dumping ground. Proposed solutions range from satellites capable of capturing debris to passive systems that de-orbit old spacecraft safely. But as the KSA warns, these fixes are technically complex and costly, and international cooperation remains limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;For Mukuku’s residents, the danger feels personal. “We need assurances from the government that it won’t happen again,” said local resident Benson Mutuku. Their fears echo a larger reality: without robust global rules and technology to manage space waste, more communities could find themselves at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a double mastectomy when I was 40 years old in 1997. I was married and had two children under the age of 11. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutting off my breasts when I didn’t have cancer seemed radical, but it wasn’t radical to me. I have the BRCA1 gene mutation. That means I have a 60% chance of getting ovarian cancer and an 85% chance of getting breast cancer ― the deadly kind that doesn’t respond to treatment. For me, those odds felt like 100%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before genetic testing was available, my mother got ovarian cancer when she was 62 and a few years later, she died. Then two of my cousins got breast cancer before they were 60 and both of them died. So, I got a prophylactic hysterectomy and a double mastectomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I’m 64, and I know I made the right decision because I’m alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the surgery, I spoke to a few other women who had mastectomies. They told me how it hurt to lift their arms after the procedure and how it took months to stretch their skin to accommodate the implants used to make reconstructed breasts. None of that scared me. I knew that a cancer diagnosis, chemotherapy, and death were, of course, much worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I had the surgery and then took my son to his first day of kindergarten three days later with surgical drains hiding under an oversized shirt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn’t ask the plastic surgeon how my breasts would look after the reconstruction. I even thought they would look better, fuller, like they did before I nursed two babies. I was wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My implants are nothing like the ones many women get to look and feel sexier. Mine, the kind you get when the surgeon scrapes every bit of breast tissue out, are right under the skin. The skin covering the implants is thin and taut, and cold to the touch ― a different temperature than the rest of my body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that breast reconstruction after a radical mastectomy is a difficult process. After the initial surgery, I had surgery six more times over the next 15 years to deal with the pain caused by scar tissue, and also to try to make my boobs look more normal. Three times, the plastic surgeons attached fake nipples made from skin taken from my pubic area, and they always fell off within a month of the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My boobs were ugly, and I hated to let anyone see them. Even doctors couldn’t hide their disgust. When I went to the dermatologist once a year for a skin cancer screening, I reminded him about my mastectomies and reconstruction to avoid the slightest change in his facial expression, like I saw the last time he opened my paper gown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the surgery, I shut the door when I took a shower or turned away from my husband when I changed my clothes in front of him. I never asked him if he wanted to see or feel my boobs, nor did he ask. I kept my T-shirt on during sex for the remaining 12 years of our marriage, and we never talked about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After my divorce and more reconstructive surgery, my breasts, now with tattooed nipples where the flesh ones should have been, looked better, but they still weren’t “normal.” They were too hard and too cold. When I started dating, it had been 30 years since I was with a man other than my husband. I was anxious about intimacy, about letting a man see or touch my over-50 body. But my breasts made me consider never dating again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I told the first man I dated how taking my shirt off made me uncomfortable, he said, “You never have to take your shirt off for me. We’ll play shirts and skins, like in a pickup basketball game.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mostly, that’s what we did for five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, when I started seeing David, I went over to his house for dinner. We were standing in his kitchen talking and sipping our drinks, a vodka cranberry for me, and a scotch for him. He looked at me and said, “I’m dying to kiss you,” and leaned in for the kiss. I kissed him back. It felt good. As the kissing got more passionate, we moved to the couch. A few minutes in, I pulled away and put my hand on his chest. &lt;/p&gt;

For example, studies show that breast cancer survivors who drank more than three to four drinks per week were at a higher risk for recurrence.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Popular pre-made canned cocktails make enjoying a drink easier than ever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The demand for alcoholic canned cocktails increased by 20 percent in 2023, and the drinks continue to gain popularity among those under the age of 45, according to a study by Veylinx. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, doctors caution even if a beverage has &lt;span&gt;low alcohol by volume (ABV), the ingredients that come with the convenience - including &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14843031/Startling-number-foods-drinks-contain-cancer-linked-ingredient-revealed-major-study.html"&gt;food dyes and preservatives&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;span&gt; can increase the risk of developing disease and neurological conditions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The National Institute of Health has found Yellow 5 to be contaminated with benzidine or other carcinogens&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are particularly concerned about colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early onset colorectal cancer has become the leading cause of cancer-related deaths for men under the age of 50 and the second-leading cause for women under 50 in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over 50,000 Americans are &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14799325/addiction-cancer-Crave-book-smoking-alcohol-fast-food.html" class=""&gt;expected to die from colorectal cancer this year&lt;/a&gt;, while 150,000 are predicted to be diagnosed with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While still a minority, experts remain concerned about increasing cases among younger people. Officials estimate 2,600 new cases among those under 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Canned cocktails such as Smirnoff Ice Red White &amp;amp; Berry are known to contain Blue 1, Red 40 and sodium citrate as some of their primary ingredients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2023 Toxicology Reports study conducted in mice found that Blue 1 dye can damage DNA and cause inflammation in the colon, potentially raising the risk of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, previous studies have shown that consumption of Blue 1 can cause seizures, liver damage, thyroid damage and may contribute to the development of tumors in the bladder and stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The petroleum-based dye has also previously been associated with childhood behavioral problems, as well as infertility in adults.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blue 1, also known as Brilliant Blue FCF, is a synthetic water-soluble food dye derived from petroleum that is used in various food items, drugs and cosmetics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The dye - which is also a major ingredient in the Monaco Blue Crush canned cocktail - is known to cause allergic reactions and hyperactivity in children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Canned cocktails such as Smirnoff Ice Red, White &amp;amp; Berry are known to contain Blue 1, Red 40 and sodium citrate as some of their primary ingredients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Red 40, or Allura Red AC, is made by extracting hydrocarbons from petroleum that are then processed with salts added to create a brilliant red color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Food companies use the ingredient to make their goods more appealing to consumers, with Red 40 being the most commonly used food dye in the US having been found in more than 36,000 products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But over recent decades, studies have suggested the coloring could be linked to hyperactivity, irritability and trouble focusing in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the FDA notes that there is not enough evidence to classify Red 40 as a risk to human health, the European Union restricted its use in 2010 and California and West Virginia have also approved bans on the coloring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/rfk-jr/index.html" id="mol-ec47ba10-6d6a-11f0-a65b-29defdbea910" class=""&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt; has been cracking down on the use of Red 40 in all items across the country and is now ready to ban the dye, months after banning Red 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sodium citrate is used as a preservative in many foods and drinks to control acidity and prevent ingredients from separating - it adds a sour and salty flavor and also works as an emulsifier in cheese, preventing it from becoming greasy when melted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The preservative, found in both White Claw Hard Seltzer and Topo Chico Mango Hard Seltzer cans, has also been proven to promote the growth of cancerous tumors in the bladder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Blue 1 is a major ingredient in the Monaco Blue Crush canned cocktail&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Apart from this, experts are also warning against ready-to-drink beverages such as canned Aperol spritz, which contains Sunset Yellow FCF (an orange-yellow azo dye) and Ponceau 4R (a red azo dye). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both dyes have been proven to cause allergic skin reactions in sensitive people, such as rash, eczema or hives, and can also lead to shortness of breath and asthma-like attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Dr Nishan Tchekmedyian, a hematologist and oncologist at City of Hope in Irvine, California&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While current evidence does not point to a significant cancer risk in adults, studies have shown that excessive consumption of Ponceau 4R can lead to neurological disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts believe that the dye contains traces of aluminum, a metal that has been previously linked to promoting the development of &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-560e2f40-6e4e-11f0-b2bd-2165c94e8f3c" class=""&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; and Parkinson's disease in the brain, which can lead to dementia and loss of motor activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ingesting aluminum in high quantities can also change the composition of bacteria in the digestive tract (the microbiome) and disrupt the immune system, leading to inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research has also found that Ponceau 4R can mimic the effects of estrogen in the women potentially affecting sexual function and leading to obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High estrogen levels can increase the risk of certain cancers, particularly breast and uterine cancers, as it can stimulate the excessive growth of cells in these organs, turning them cancerous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another popular canned cocktail, especially with younger Americans, is BuzzBallz, which has&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;nearly 30 grams of sugar per bottle and harmful dyes such as Yellow 5 and Blue 1, both of which have been linked to hyperactivity and neurological issues in multiple animal studies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sodium citrate is used as a preservative in many drinks including Topo Chico Mango Hard Seltzer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;BuzzBallz drinks are made of harmful dyes such as Yellow 5 and Blue 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'I wouldn't recommend drinking BuzzBallz, not even occasionally,' Dr Michelle Routhenstein, a preventive cardiology dietitian, told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'With 15 percent alcohol and nearly 30 grams of added sugar in a single serving, they pack an undesirable combination that can spike blood pressure and blood sugar, cause arrhythmias, strain the liver, promote fat buildup, and increase inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'From a cardiovascular standpoint, these drinks pose unnecessary risk with no health benefit, and over time, they can negatively contribute to chronic conditions like heart disease, fatty liver and type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-e68953a0-61c0-11f0-84e9-f11a28450733" class=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Excess sugar consumption on a regular basis can pave the way for weight gain, high blood pressure, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity, both of which are major risks for cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the American Heart Association, men should consume no more than 36 grams or 150 calories of sugar per day while women should consume no more than 25 grams or 100 calories of sugar per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, Yellow 5, also known as tartrazine, is a synthetic food dye approved by the FDA for use in food, beverages, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies have linked the dye to hyperactivity in children and genotoxicity, meaning it can damage DNA and potentially lead to cancer in adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The National Institute of Health has also found Yellow 5 to be contaminated with benzidine and other carcinogens that can increase the risk of cancer development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Daily Mail has reached out Smirnoff, Monaco Blue, White Claw, Topo Chico and BuzzBallz for a comment, but has not heard back.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 22:00:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2gFBVV95cUxQYWJTb2lPaFFLejVoRjBnMi1pTWs4aW56bjdfa0w3UW9ySm02dU9sT0RwTmZWV1lfSnR0Q3lWMWFpSTJqNnVXRW1iaHRLZ0ppckNpX2dBaVFIaVdUMURnQkdzbHl3VmQ1NnhSazVtWDQ4RnJXTFlqdjBlbExSaEl3TlhCZ25mSUpYeWQtWEVNTmpxb052VldXLTJiejR1RHZnWENwazZsLTNVYzY3ZnlTM0xrZmFIN0ZnYjY5VkVfREJCQ2g3bHQyLVU1RVpPSk9VNW5BWmdGT2RCQQ</guid></item><item><title>对可能降低癌症治疗效果的常见甜味剂的警告-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A common artificial sweetener loved by millions weakens the effects of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-47601180-6f15-11f0-b899-97c7884526fb"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;University of Pittsburgh researchers discovered that sucralose, a zero-calorie sweetener, reduced immunotherapy effectiveness in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Initially developed in the 1970s for people with obesity and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-4760d4d0-6f15-11f0-b899-97c7884526fb" class=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; to sweeten food while avoiding blood sugar spikes, sucralose, more &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14539329/Sugar-free-diet-foods-artificial-sweetener.html"&gt;commonly known as Splenda&lt;/a&gt;, has become ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s used in over 4,500 foods and drinks, including diet sodas and low-calorie foods. In the US, it accounts for 30 percent of the sweetener market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy, which boosts the immune system to recognize and kill cancer cells, may reach for a diet soda or sugar-free baked good, believing they’re &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11950929/Youd-need-consume-75-packets-Splenda-DAY-suffer-health-problems-fear.html"&gt;making a healthy choice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, sucralose kills some good bacteria that reside in the gut while allowing harmful strains to grow, impacting the body’s ability to digest foods and break down fiber, train immune cells to fight pathogens, make vitamins like folate and B12, produce serotonin, and reduce inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Senior author Dr Diwakar Davar, an oncologist and hematologist at UPMC, said in a statement: ‘We found that sucralose impeded the effectiveness of immunotherapies across a range of cancer types, stages and treatment modalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘These observations raise the possibility of designing prebiotics, such as targeted nutrient supplementation for patients who consume high levels of sucralose.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cancer patients on immunotherapy might choose diet drinks or sugar-free treats thinking they're healthier options (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team used mouse models, some with lung cancer and some with melanoma, to test how sucralose altered their microbiomes, finding that the sweetener disrupted the delicate balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This reduced key amino acids such as arginine, which are needed to fuel immune cells. It also led to dysfunctional CD8+ T cells, critical for fighting cancer, and blunted the effects of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, a class of cancer treatments that includes popular medicines Keytruda and Opdivo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead author Dr Abby Overacre, an immunology professor at Pitt and UPMC Hillman, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.upmc.com/media/news/073125-artificial-sweetner"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: ‘When arginine levels were depleted due to sucralose-driven shifts in the microbiome, T cells couldn’t function properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘As a result, immunotherapy wasn’t as effective in mice that were fed sucralose.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To assess the relevance of these findings for humans, they questioned 132 advanced cancer patients, including 91 people with melanoma and 41 with lung cancer, about their sucralose intake, as well as 25 people at high risk of their melanoma recurring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People reported drinking diet sodas, using the artificial sweetener in coffee and tea, and eating low-calorie snacks sweetened with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A high amount of sucralose was considered anything above 0.16 mg per kilogram of body weight per day. For a 155-lb person, that’s less than a single packet of Splenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with melanoma and lung cancer who consumed at least that much sucralose had a 3.2 times higher risk of their cancer progressing faster, as well as less tumor shrinkage in response to immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sucralose reduced immunotherapy effectiveness in various cancers regardless of type, stage, or treatment approach  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People at risk of melanoma recurrence who drank or ate at least that much sucralose had a higher risk of their cancer returning after surgery and immunotherapy and fewer signs of a strong immune response to tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experiments in mice revealed that disruption to the microbiome due to sucralose was the driving force behind alterations in their cancer-fighting T cells, which were starved of the crucial amino acid arginine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When scientists transplanted feces from sucralose-fed mice into untreated mice, the latter exhibited a similar poor immune response to immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when scientists supplemented their low levels of arginine using the amino acid citrulline, commonly found in melons, pumpkins, and legumes, T cells regained their cancer-killing ability, reversed their resistance to immunotherapy, and their tumors shrank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their findings were published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article/doi/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-25-0247/763776/Sucralose-consumption-ablates-cancer-immunotherapy"&gt;Cancer Discovery&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Overacre said: ‘It’s easy to say, “Stop drinking diet soda,” but when patients are being treated for cancer, they are already dealing with enough, so asking them to drastically alter their diet may not be realistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We need to meet patients where they are. That’s why it’s so exciting that arginine supplementation could be a simple approach to counteract the negative effects of sucralose on immunotherapy.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers hope to launch a clinical trial investigating whether citrulline supplements, which boost arginine levels more than arginine itself, affect the gut microbiome and anti-tumor immune response in patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Further, 71 per cent were obese and more than one-third had metabolic syndrome — a cluster of risk factors that heighten vulnerability to diabetes, cardiovascular disease and stroke.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-before-before" id="inside_post_content_ad_1_before_before"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-before" id="inside_post_content_ad_1_before"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-1 inside-post-ad ads_common_inside_post" id="inside_post_content_ad_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-after" id="inside_post_content_ad_1_after"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The health of India’s workforce is paramount,” said Nadda, emphasising the ministry of health’s existing guidelines under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases (NP-NCD). These guidelines focus on promoting healthy diets, regular exercise, weight control, and reducing intake of sugar and saturated fats.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replying to questions from Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi and others, Nadda said recent Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) findings showed a 37.19 per cent prevalence of fatty liver disease even in rural Rajasthan, underlining its spread beyond urban centres.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-before-before" id="inside_post_content_ad_2_before_before"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-before" id="inside_post_content_ad_2_before"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-2 inside-post-ad ads_common_inside_post" id="inside_post_content_ad_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-after" id="inside_post_content_ad_2_after"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To raise awareness, the government is conducting extensive campaigns across print, electronic, and digital media platforms. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has rolled out creative public outreach materials, including engaging short videos on liver health.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognising the sedentary nature of IT jobs, the ministry of AYUSH has introduced a five-minute “Yoga Break” protocol to be followed during office hours. It combines simple yoga postures (Asanas), breathing techniques (Pranayama) and meditation (Dhyana) to promote physical and mental well-being.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-before-before" id="inside_post_content_ad_3_before_before"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-before" id="inside_post_content_ad_3_before"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-3 inside-post-ad ads_common_inside_post" id="inside_post_content_ad_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-after" id="inside_post_content_ad_3_after"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, integrated clinical guidelines that blend traditional Indian medicine with modern protocols have been published to ensure a holistic national response. States and Union Territories have been asked to implement screening and referral systems at the community level to aid early detection and intervention.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadda emphasised inter-ministerial collaboration and workplace health advisories as vital tools to combat the rising tide of metabolic and lifestyle diseases, especially in urban corporate ecosystems.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-before-before" id="inside_post_content_ad_4_before_before"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-before" id="inside_post_content_ad_4_before"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-4 inside-post-ad ads_common_inside_post" id="inside_post_content_ad_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-after" id="inside_post_content_ad_4_after"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spotlight on Hyderabad’s IT workforce is galvanising India’s public health machinery to address a crucial but under-recognised epidemic to safeguard the well-being of millions in fast-evolving workplaces. The prevalence of increased liver fat and obesity conditions in IT employees highlights the profound impact of sedentary, high-stress work environments common in the tech industry. These findings have prompted comprehensive workplace wellness initiatives to safeguard the health of India’s young, urban workforce.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad filler-ad-unit-inside-post" id="filler_ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key Highlights:  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. 84% of Hyderabad IT employees affected by MAFLD; 71% obese; 34% with Metabolic Syndrome  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

Measles, however, had been a victim of statutory rape. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although she broke away and ran for help, she was chased down by one of the perpetrators, Segar, and dragged back to her death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maryann Measles was last seen on October 19, 1997, when she was abducted from a supermarket parking lot by five men and three women&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It was years before her friends and family members found out the truth about what happened &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recounting hearing how his late friend Measles died, a man named Scott said in the documentary: 'Them beating on her and raping her and holding her under the water until the bubbles stopped, that's probably the comment that haunts me the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Until the bubbles stopped.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another friend, Donna, added: 'They wrapped her in blankets and chains and they threw her into the river. It breaks my heart that I wasn't there to help her.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Months before her life was taken, Measles began hanging out with the group of older friends who would later attack and kill her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One evening, she confessed to her mother that she had been raped by some of the older men in the group, including Walter and Foster. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles's mother took her to the police station to file statutory rape charges against the men, however only filed a report regarding Walter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although they planned to file a report against Foster, the group of friends hatched a plan to silence Measles, who had opened up about her ordeal and confined in her plan to June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nine months after her death, Measles's body was found in Lake Lillinonah in Connecticut, but it was still years before police made any progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Measles was in the seventh grade when her friends kidnapped her and killed her&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the summer of 2001, four years later, cops offered a $50,000 reward for people to come forward with evidence to help solve the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Segar, one of the killers, was keen to get her hands on the money and in 2005, she reached out to police and led them to a crucial piece of evidence: an abandoned washing machine in the middle of the woods containing Measles's clothes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After linking herself to the crime, Segel admitted that there was eight people involved in the murder and that Walter orchestrated it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking in the documentary, Measles's friend Ashleigh said: 'I was just so sick to think that Mariann thought she was hanging out with friends, but they were planning on murdering her.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was mind-blowing seeing their pictures in cuffs in the news and all over the newspapers,' Scott added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was like wow, I spent every day with those people. I was hanging out with a group of murderers and I didn't even know it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I will always harbour some guilt and blame because I literally introduced one of my best friends to her killers and that will never go away.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Walter had sex with the teen's corpse before they wrapped her in blanket, tied it with a chain and padlock and then pushed her into the lake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Foster was the only perpetrator whose case went to trial where he was sentenced to 110 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Keith Foster was sentenced to 110 years in prison for his role in Measles's murder &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alan Walter plead guilty to felony murder, first-degree kidnapping, conspiracy to commit first-degree kidnapping, conspiracy to commit first-degree sexual assault, and tampering with physical evidence &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was guilty on charges that included felony murder, first-degree sexual assault, three counts of first-degree kidnapping, conspiracy to commit first-degree kidnapping, tampering with a witness, and tampering with physical evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, Walter was handed a 60-year sentence for his involvement and was charged with felony murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For their part in the murder, Boyette was sentenced to 50 years, Dupas was sentenced to 47 years , Rajcok was sentenced to 36 years, Segar was sentenced to 30 years, and Hallas was sentenced to 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bennett was sentenced to 19 years after she was charged with first-degree kidnapping, conspiracy to commit kidnapping, risk of injury to a minor, tampering with a witness, and tampering with evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time of writing, only one out of the eight perpetrators has been released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bennett, who received the lightest sentence due to her plea deal, was freed in 2019 after 19 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She testified that at least three of the boys took turns raping Measles before dragging her to the water to drown her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reflecting on the murder, Measles's younger sister commented in the documentary: 'Two of the guys would have got 18 months for statutory rape, so instead they ended her life and ruined all of ours forever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've never raised my kids to believe there are not monsters… I've lived my life with eight monsters.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 20:47:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPaUZJUEVlT0VBV2FKMHgtYjZfOE9HOEVhRy1Md1RfWkJnajU5aS03NDdwcENmUzRQQnBlbGNCNURxeDZwM09KcXFYb3pPUFpvWWdNTGdQN2hKS01NaWJRU3VwTF9CSWh6ODN3ck5mSkdfaU1sMTN2WFFXTlpINWJUWVJLT1U2S1llQWcyLTVlOFZmMGdkb0xqbTYtYXY3dXIwT3Rhb29mWnRZZE1F0gGyAUFVX3lxTE5lcmZtMVpXOF85SUlvbF9LZlc2emRSUGg0elRBWUhDb2tsRWdYLTY0VnQyT0d3Nkc2LXhoV24yenEzSENUYlVYMTM3TkpJSXhlQTg3S1pVNC1UejZJaWZLYVpNMjMtSXd5U19yS2F5WG91VzZjUVdvVHhnT0w1MkJkcmpVV0hueVNiVEtxWmE0dzFCWDg5SmlrVlBibjVXSkt6R2liSDZYaTBvUmE4Q25HdHc</guid></item><item><title>在RFK Jr的领导下， CDC跳过了疫苗接种率的研究，悄悄地在DROP上发布数据- Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxNQUFlZ3hRMDRNNWJjU3EwOWRfUjBxajRNbTA5alprcW9ocVgwbDVzVzJzV1NqQzVsSGxEdjJWR3BNN193dnNpMXktRk5iQ05KeWllaW5wT2NjY3d5RW5vaWZJMnFEcWNRZ3hVdjB1M0VodWZpdTZLd1NwQmwySWpLZDF6TlNyYU9BQ3E0dmJfeS1vaVV1TDdaWXo5ZVZHelhsaEJPR2pRSkF4YWI0TE9idUczc0RKMTg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates among the country's kindergartners have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html"&gt;fallen once again&lt;/a&gt;, with coverage of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination dropping from 92.7 percent in the 2023–2024 school year to 92.5 percent in 2024–2025. The percentage changes are small across the board, but they represent thousands of children and an ongoing downward trend that makes the country more vulnerable to outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest school year, an estimated 286,000 young children were not fully protected against measles. At the same time, the country has seen numerous explosive measles outbreaks, with case counts in 2025 already higher than any other year since the highly infectious disease was declared eliminated in 2000. In fact, the case count is at &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/measles-cases-reach-33-year-high-as-rfk-jr-pursues-anti-vaccine-agenda/"&gt;a 33-year high&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest small decline is one in a series that is eroding the nation's ability to keep bygone infectious diseases at bay. In the 2019–2020 school year, 95 percent of kindergartners were protected against measles and other serious childhood diseases, such as polio. That 95 percent coverage is the target that health experts say prevents an infectious disease from spreading in a community. But amid the pandemic, vaccination rates fell, dropping to 93.9 percent MMR coverage in the 2020–2021 year, and have kept creeping downward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anti-vaccine era&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the height of the pandemic, some slippage in immunization coverage could be blamed on disrupted access. But anti-vaccine sentiments and misinformation are clearly playing a large role as vaccination continues to decline and access has largely resumed. For the 2024–2025 school year, nonmedical exemptions for childhood vaccinations once again hit a new high. These are exemptions driven by ideology and have risen with the influence of anti-vaccine voices, including current health secretary and fervent anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;

They discovered that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14821553/Dirty-habit-smoking-marijuana-heart-health-disease.html"&gt;daily smokers were&lt;/a&gt; 3.25 times more likely to develop oral cancer than those without the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Raphael Cuomo, an anesthesiology professor at UC San Diego School of Medicine who led the analysis, said: ‘Cannabis smoke contains many of the same carcinogenic compounds found in tobacco smoke, which have known damaging effects on the epithelial tissue that lines the mouth.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cannabis smoke packs a heavy load of toxic chemicals and carcinogens, about 2,600 of them, similar to tobacco smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But researchers are only recently getting a fuller understanding of what those chemicals are. They now know that marijuana smoke contains hundreds of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), benzene, and ammonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These chemicals adhere to mucus membranes in the mouth, enabling carcinogens to seep into oral tissue. Meanwhile, THC, the psychoactive chemical in marijuana, can suppress crucial immune system pathways that would typically patrol for, and kill, those rogue cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nearly 18 million Americans are daily or near-daily cannabis users, which researchers have found increases the risk of oral cancer by more than three times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the more than 45,000 patients included in the study, 949 had cannabis use disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The group that did not smoke or smoked only occasionally remained either weed free or only occasional users over the five-year study. Over 97 percent were still abstinent or infrequent users by the time researchers followed up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the study, 106 patients were diagnosed with oral cancer. Among people without CUD, the rate of oral cancer was 0.23 percent, which matches general population rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, among participants with CUD, 0.74 percent developed oral cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oral cancer includes cancerous growths that develop in the mouth and throat, including the lips, tongue, gums, the floor of the mouth and the roof of the mouth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in 59 men and 1 in 139 women will develop oral cancer at some point in their lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oral cancers account for about three percent of cancers diagnosed in the US every year, with about 58,500 diagnoses and 12,250 deaths annually. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said their findings will have implications for cancer screening practices in primary care and mental health settings, as patients with CUD often present with overlapping social and behavioral risk factors, including tobacco use, alcohol use, and a lower likelihood of engaging in preventive healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with CUD who were also tobacco users were 6.24 times more likely to get oral cancer. Age also played a role, with each additional year of age increasing cancer risk by about four times per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like tobacco smokers, marijuana smokers see damage to their lung and throat cells, leading to abnormal cell growth that can cause cancer and tissue changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those effects can occur in people who are not tobacco smokers, though, indicating that marijuana smoke can be just as harmful on its own as cigarette smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Cuomo said: ‘These findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that chronic or problematic cannabis use may contribute to cancer risk in tissues exposed to combustion products.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their findings were published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335525002244"&gt;Preventive Medicine Reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the United States, marijuana is fully legal for recreational and medicinal use in 29 states. It is entirely illegal in four states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The majority of the public, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/03/26/most-americans-favor-legalizing-marijuana-for-medical-recreational-use/"&gt;about 88 percent&lt;/a&gt;, supports legalization, according to the Pew Research Center. But public health experts are raising concerns over potential long-term effects, of which scientists still do not have a complete understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In June, University of California researchers reviewed 24 studies involving 200million people to investigate the relationship between weed and cardiovascular disease, stroke and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) - a group of heart conditions in which there is reduced or blocked blood flow to the heart, such as a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found there was a 29 percent higher risk of ACS among cannabis users, a 20 percent higher risk for stroke and double the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, which includes coronary artery disease, heart failure and irregular heartbeats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last month, findings from an FDA-run clinical trial were released, investigating dangerous liver enzyme spikes in people who consumed cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cannabis is becoming easier to access and more potent. The graph refers to smokable cannabis. Other forms, such as vapes, contain up to 98 percent of THC, the psychoactive chemical in the drug linked to psychosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results showed that eight users of CBD, the substance derived from the hemp plant that's free of the psychoactive chemical THC, developed enzyme spikes above the safe threshold, raising the risk of chronic liver damage or failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seven people dropped out due to liver concerns between weeks three and four. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, everyone's liver tests normalized after quitting CBD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, regular use of potent cannabis in adolescence has been linked to long-term changes in brain structure, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, the region responsible for decision-making, emotional regulation, and impulse control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is also the age when many psychotic disorders first appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;THC may trigger schizophrenia or psychotic episodes in individuals with genetic predispositions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2022 review by University of Bath researchers, which analyzed 20 studies involving 120,000 people, found users of high-potency cannabis were four times more likely to develop addiction and three to five times more likely to suffer a psychotic break compared to those using lower-potency strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, a report in JAMA Network Open found that emergency room visits in Ontario, Canada, linked to schizophrenia in marijuana users tripled after legalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 2006 and 2022, the rate of schizophrenia among those with cannabis use disorder climbed from four percent to over 10 percent. In contrast, just 0.6 percent of non-users developed the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

People who eventually develop MS began increasing healthcare visits—especially for general symptoms like fatigue, pain, and anxiety—15 years before neurologists identified their first demyelinating event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest a lengthy prodromal phase for MS, similar to early-stage Parkinson’s disease, where nonspecific symptoms quietly precede more recognizable ones. Identifying this earlier timeline could lead to proactive support, monitoring, and even future prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long Prodrome:&lt;/strong&gt; Healthcare usage increased steadily over 15 years before MS diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Indicators:&lt;/strong&gt; Fatigue, dizziness, mental health issues, and eye problems were among the first signs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Shift:&lt;/strong&gt; Results challenge the belief that MS only begins with clear neurological symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of British Columbia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earliest warning signs of multiple sclerosis (MS) may emerge more than a decade before the first classical neurological symptoms occur, according to new research from the University of British Columbia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Published today in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, the study analyzed the health records of more than 12,000 people in British Columbia and found that those with MS began using healthcare services at elevated rates 15 years before their first MS symptoms appear.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings challenge long-held assumptions about when the disease truly begins, offering the most comprehensive picture to date of how patients engage with a range of healthcare providers in the years leading up to a diagnosis as they search for answers to ill-defined medical challenges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“MS can be difficult to recognize as many of the earliest signs—like fatigue, headache, pain and mental health concerns—can be quite general and easily mistaken for other conditions,” said senior author Dr. Helen Tremlett, professor of neurology at UBC’s faculty of medicine and investigator at the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings dramatically shift the timeline for when these early warning signs are thought to begin, potentially opening the door to opportunities for earlier detection and intervention.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study used linked clinical and administrative provincial health data to track physician visits in the 25 years leading up to the onset of a patient’s MS symptoms, as determined by a neurologist through detailed medical history and clinical assessments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is the first study to examine healthcare usage this far back in a patient’s clinical history. Most previous studies only examined trends in the five to 10 years leading up to a patient’s first demyelinating event (such as vision problems) using administrative data. This is a much later benchmark compared to the neurologist-determined date of symptom onset.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings revealed that, when compared to the general population, people with MS had a steady build-up of healthcare engagement over 15 years with different types of doctor visits increasing at distinct points in time:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;15 years before symptom onset:&lt;/strong&gt; Visits to general practice physicians increased, as did visits to any physician for symptoms like fatigue, pain, dizziness and mental health conditions including anxiety and depression.&lt;br&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;12 years before:&lt;/strong&gt; Visits to a psychiatrist increased.&lt;br&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Eight to nine years before:&lt;/strong&gt; Visits to neurologists and ophthalmologists increased, which could relate to issues like blurry vision or eye pain.&lt;br&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Three to five years before:&lt;/strong&gt; Emergency medicine and radiology visits increased.&lt;br&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;One year before:&lt;/strong&gt; Physician visits across multiple specialties peaked, including neurology, emergency medicine and radiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These patterns suggest that MS has a long and complex prodromal phase—where something is happening beneath the surface but hasn’t yet declared itself as MS,” said Dr. Marta Ruiz-Algueró, a postdoctoral fellow at UBC and the study’s first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re only now starting to understand what these early warning signs are, with mental health-related issues appearing to be among the earliest indicators.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study builds on previous work by Dr. Tremlett and her team to characterize the early stages of MS, or prodromal phase, when subtle symptoms appear before the hallmark signs become recognizable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prodromal periods are well established in other neurological disorders, like Parkinson’s disease, where mood changes, sleep disturbances and constipation often arise years before the more familiar motor symptoms like tremors and stiffness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the researchers caution that the vast majority of people who experience general symptoms will not go on to develop MS, they say recognizing and characterizing the MS prodrome could one day help accelerate diagnosis and improve outcomes for patients.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“By identifying these earlier red flags, we may eventually be able to intervene sooner—whether that’s through monitoring, support or preventive strategies,” said Dr. Tremlett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It opens new avenues for research into early biomarkers, lifestyle factors and other potential triggers that may be at play during this previously overlooked phase of the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this multiple sclerosis research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0173647869606f602f69646075696473686f66756e6f417463622f6260" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Reyhana Heatherington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ubc.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Reyhana Heatherington – University of British Columbia&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.24635" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Healthcare use before multiple sclerosis symptom onset&lt;/a&gt;” by Helen Tremlett et al. &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthcare use before multiple sclerosis symptom onset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health care use increases before multiple sclerosis (MS) onset. However, most studies have focused on the 5 to 10 years preceding the first demyelinating disease code from administrative data. Few studies have examined patterns before clinically determined MS symptom onset from clinical records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine health care use 25 years before MS symptom onset in a clinical cohort from British Columbia, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design, Setting, and Participants&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This matched cohort study accessed data prospectively collected from January 1991 to September 2018. All data were released mid-2024 for analysis. The study was conducted in British Columbia using publicly funded universal health insurance data. Patients with MS were identified from MS clinic records and matched with up to 5 individuals randomly selected without replacement from the general population by sex, birth year, socioeconomic status, and postal code of residency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linked clinical and administrative data were used to compare physician visit rates 25 years before MS onset using adjusted negative binomial models and 15 years before MS onset by &lt;em&gt;International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;ICD-9&lt;/em&gt;) chapter and physician specialty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 2038 patients with MS (mean [SD] age at symptom onset, 37.9 [10.9] years; 1508 female [74.0%]) and 10 182 matched individuals were included. All-cause physician visit rate ratios (RRs) for patients with MS were consistently elevated from 14 years before onset (adjusted RR [ARR], 1.19; 95% CI, 1.07-1.33), peaking the year before MS onset (ARR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.21-1.35).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RRs for ill-defined symptoms and signs were consistently elevated 15 years before onset, exceeding 1.15 and peaking at 1.37 (95% CI, 1.19-1.56) the year before MS onset. Mental health–related RRs from 14 years before onset were significant (excluding years 7, 5, and 4), with RRs in the 3 years before MS onset ranging from 1.30 (95% CI, 1.05-1.58) to 1.38 (95% CI, 1.12-1.68).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensory, musculoskeletal, and nervous system RRs were elevated 8, 5, and 4 years before onset, respectively, with, for example, a peak of 2.42 (95% CI, 1.90-3.07) for nervous system concerns the year before MS onset. By physician specialty, general practice visit RRs were significantly elevated in each of the 15 years before MS onset, reaching 1.23 (95% CI, 1.17-1.30) in the year before onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychiatry visit RRs were elevated 12 years before onset (2.59; 95% CI, 1.23-5.47). Neurology and ophthalmology RRs were significantly higher up to 8 to 9 years before onset, peaking the year before MS onset at 5.46 (95% CI, 4.30-6.93) for neurology and 1.64 (95% CI, 1.30-2.08) for ophthalmology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this matched cohort study of people with and without MS, health care use was higher among patients with MS 14 to 15 years before MS symptom onset, suggesting that MS may have started earlier than previously thought. Mental health and psychiatric issues along with ill-defined signs and symptoms might be among the earliest features of the prodromal period preceding nervous system–related and neurologic visits by 7 to 11 years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 19:53:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBVVHlJdkl1eWxZZ1kzMEZuTnNjeVBNUERmekl5REJVZGVEZE1lWUstX1MxM3FGbW5iZDdEb2hzLXd5a0hEeGhUV2phaVh1MGxmY0tWQWEwYi1xOGlON3JIcldENTRtNzFpdTZiZkw5RWhSeWdm</guid></item><item><title>蝙蝠在亚利桑那州飞进女人的嘴里，花费了她近21,000美元的医疗费用- NBC新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxON28zSUZrTmsyOE1yMDdDVUlXR194TkRybzczSTFpQjZaQmtZb3NDYTNmbHh3eW80RzdzZDFBNk1oaUZvNzIxZ2l5ZVhIdU0zOWdTalZHYjA0Ui1HRzBjNlRjU0UyYzVQa0JscEVPeXBwVmFXMlRia3pCdWpJalR6T1RWdzRpSTlSeVQyOUVHUmoyUl9pWjRuU2hUb1N1amtaUm90ZmN0NUJ3ei1Rd1E0dnJaRdIBVkFVX3lxTE1iUmthYXJ4eW5FYnc2bWJxSGdnMHpzZy1QdG9pNHZvRUxWVGhjWWsyR1RjaGttWFdONlBRaHhaYlpsa05yOWtod1ZCa0RtaklvdzRzUGt3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2eaaeb" class="body-graf"&gt;A Massachusetts woman was bitten by nearly $21,000 in medical bills &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/chicago-concert-rabies-bat-exposure-rcna174362" target="_blank"&gt;after a bat flew &lt;/a&gt;into her mouth during a freak incident while vacationing in Northern Arizona, the unlucky traveler said Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d7038d" class="body-graf"&gt;Erica Kahn, now 33, had recently lost her job as a biomedical engineer when she traveled to the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in last August, she told NBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b92c72" class="body-graf"&gt;Kahn, whose woman-vs.-animal story was first reported Thursday by &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/tourist-rabies-treatment-wild-bat-in-mouth-surprise-bill-of-the-month/" target="_blank"&gt;KFF News&lt;/a&gt;, was snapping pictures of the night sky when a bat approached and got caught in between her camera and face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b87d6f" class="body-graf"&gt;Then a part of the bat got into her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-398796" class="body-graf"&gt;"It was kind of dark out and we were out on a cliff, so I was looking down and at my camera, I didn't really see it coming," she said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c0e59e" class="body-graf"&gt;"When it got kind of tangled between my face and the camera, it was probably just like a few seconds.

It is critical for hundreds of basic biochemical processes, including muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, the ability of cells to create proteins, and blood pressure regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also calms the nervous system before bed, relaxes the muscles, and helps produce the sleep hormone melatonin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over 70 million Americans &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14950975/study-link-irregular-sleep-172-diseases.html"&gt;struggle with insomnia&lt;/a&gt;, and around a quarter of Americans experience daytime sleepiness as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Magnesium has been shown in double-blind placebo-controlled trials, the research gold standard, to extend a person's time asleep, improve sleep quality, increase the concentration of melatonin, and decrease the stress hormone cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For sleep improvement, it is crucial to choose magnesium glycinate over magnesium citrate, which is a laxative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Over 70 million Americans struggle with insomnia. But clinical research has shown magnesium glycinate helps people sleep longer and more efficiently&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The recommended daily amount of magnesium is 320 milligrams (mg) a day for women and 420 mg a day for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blood tests can show whether someone is deficient in magnesium, which can lead to muscle cramps and fatigue, or more serious conditions like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. The normal range for blood magnesium is 1.7 to 2.2 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One fan of the supplement on Reddit said: ‘It does really improve my sleep in my own experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When I tried magnesium, it's the first time in like decades that I'm sleeping straight for like eight to nine hours. I used to sleep like six hours a day.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another person said: ‘Magnesium did wonders for my restless legs and overall capability to rest. Great stuff!’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A third added: ‘I've taken magnesium for the past five years and swear by it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some people mentioned, though, that the benefits to their sleep were short-lived, with one saying: ‘It's effects wore off after doing it two nights in a row or so.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some combine it with other supplements for a boost. A commenter said she takes magnesium glycinate combined with calcium and zinc, ‘and I believe it has helped me.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Magnesium glycinate calms the nervous system before bed, relaxes the muscles, and helps produce the sleep hormone melatonin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The three-part nighttime cocktail can bring out several benefits, such as enhancing muscle relaxation and melatonin synthesis, boosting GABA (which slows down brain activity), and supporting deeper sleep. The trio may also stabilize circadian rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Magnesium glycinate is well-absorbed in the body, making it more effective, and its gentle nature on the stomach makes it a popular choice for people who struggle to fall asleep or sleep through the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2012 double-blind, randomized &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3703169/"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; suggests that magnesium supplementation may significantly improve both subjective and objective measures of insomnia in older adults, offering a potential alternative to conventional sleep medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, conducted among 46 elderly people, found that an eight-week regimen of 500 mg of magnesium daily led to notable improvements in sleep duration, efficiency, and key hormonal markers linked to sleep regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings, while they seem small, were statistically significant improvements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They revealed that compared to placebo, the magnesium group experienced statistically significant increases in sleep time by 0.2 percent and sleep efficiency increased by three percent, alongside reductions in sleep onset latency by two percent and insomnia severity scores down by 0.06 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Biomarkers such as serum renin, an enzyme that helps regulate blood pressure, and melatonin rose significantly, by more than 0.1 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cortisol levels associated with wakefulness declined significantly by 0.8 percent, suggesting that magnesium plays a dual role in modulating both brain chemical pathways and the body’s circadian rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Getting too little sleep, generally considered to be fewer than seven hours, contributes to several health issues, including bloating, brittle nails, overeating, diabetes, and poor skin. It can also leave people with too little energy to exercise and be active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Past research has shown that ghrelin, a hormone promoting hunger, increases with insufficient sleep, while leptin, a hormone contributing to satiety perception, decreases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Poor sleep hygiene has also been linked to inflammation in the body, which can spur the growth of cancer cells, and a higher risk of heart attack or stroke, dementia, and autoimmune disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 18:46:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQWG5Mc1p1ZDdXR3puaUhpYjk4aThrSlpDNldNdzM5TkJhYTlJZThrOWxlX01qQTA1U2l3UlJKZkROOEdBRUQ1SVpPdFVodFpaYWU4bUEtYzdFMHFfUlJmaVE0VTVNX2JWbzVpQm11TkxvVGJsbEVzc0pjQWVXWVM1dWZJbkpUZ2tMSGo2VXpkbjlPZmhxUFdRcHdXRzlVS05TSlFqS0dYbjVOMEdoNExrOWJB0gG3AUFVX3lxTFBkSklWanpfVl9BbDJ3UEZ1SzVjVkVVeG1vb1pBTkRpMFgxN2ZWSlFHQWZHbjI5cFQyOEZTclBnc05udjNDbW03ZmhKQlZ6ZFc0bUtoelhFM3dJV1FiRlN6dHVSYzlITWZXRlU0Nzg5YWwtMDFCWXpSRVd4anQxbi1ia01qTUp5amljclJlOThRRl9aMnBTdWVKb2FRWHhIaUhteGZNdUo0UzA5ejhmQUhzMFhtcjI5Zw</guid></item><item><title>我的姻亲要求我们提供不可能的帮助。我丈夫让情况变得更糟。-石板</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxNM2JsYVhuemhueGlPeVRweUk5SU5PdXZiX0lpVXQwUUhESkQ0YUEwb3BnUUpKY0g1YWxpUlg2NjMzN0ZVbmxTbG1JSlRVeVYxWF9KU29kNFdac3hiYUxDYi1HOWM3cDVqWmhySjRiUExzdEc0WXJzUzl0RFRxODRLU1hn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="81" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdt4q4ci000j3b7auj8ypuce@published"&gt;My husband’s sister is going through a difficult time: She made some choices that led to her losing her job and may also potentially end her marriage. For now, she and her two middle-school-age kids are staying with my husband’s parents, about an hour away from us. My father-in-law and mother-in-law privately reached out to us to ask if we could take the kids on Saturdays. My in-laws are aging, the kids are emotionally struggling, and the combination is really hard.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdt4stx000113b7a6vy32m6b@published"&gt;We have a new baby, and I was not thrilled about the prospect of trying to fit two middle schoolers into the grind of baby care, chores, and no sleep. Money and time are already tight. Plus, I’m still in physical therapy from birth issues. But I agreed to take the kids on Saturdays, with one caveat: That my husband would do most of the active care for them. He agreed, and to his credit, he has been planning activities for the kids. He also isn’t afraid to lay down rules and say no to them.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdt59m8m002j3b7av0oksem3@published"&gt;But the one thing my husband won’t do is food. He’s always avoided doing the shopping and cooking in our house: If there’s no dinner, he’d rather have crackers than shop. One of the kids has very specific dietary needs, something no one told us until my mother-in-law was literally dropping them off. I’m already struggling to feed myself (I’m ravenous all the time from breastfeeding and struggling to keep my weight up). I cannot be planning and budgeting for other people’s brand-name-only specific foods from a store 45 minutes away!&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t want the child to go hungry, but I cannot do one more thing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="61" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdt4q4lz000n3b7asb2t8zen@published"&gt;Don’t do it! Your husband is taking care of these kids and he should be able to feed them. If there are times where you can prepare a meal for everyone that meets your nibling’s dietary needs, then great; you can also try to have a snack on hand for them if you can squeeze that into your normal grocery shopping.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdt55q5700253b7a2dglk9bu@published"&gt;But this is not your responsibility. If your husband can’t feed these children, then they can’t come to the house. I could see if your husband’s work schedule prevented him from getting food, but his excuse is simply not wanting to do it? He’s weaponizing his incompetence. I hate that this may mean your nibling will have a few light meals until you husband either gets it together to cook something more substantial or gets out of the babysitting arrangement. But if you step in now, he’ll never get his act together.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdt57ohp00293b7aadvo3gwh@published"&gt;Let your husband know that it is unconscionable that he refuses to provide food for his niblings, especially considering that you are dealing with postpartum issues. Be clear that you won’t be taking on this responsibility and stick to it. If he continues to let the kids come over without adequately caring for them, talk to your in-laws about what’s going on. Your sister-in-law may simply have to make other arrangements. Also, if this is a recurrent issue you’re having with regards to your husband helping around the house, it may be time for couple’s counseling.&lt;/p&gt;

Keep your little one out of Grandma’s house until she makes some major changes. If you’re up to it, you may offer to join in and organize, but if her problem is as bad as it sounds, she probably won’t take your help. Let your husband know that this is not a personal gripe with his mother, but that her place is simply unsafe. Tell him that she needs professional help and offer to brainstorm ideas for how you can make that happening. Hoarding is a serious issue, and it’s not going to go away just because she’s denied a visit from  her grandchild.  You shouldn’t compromise your child’s safety to please her, nor your husband. Keep your foot firmly planted down.&lt;/p&gt;

When the baby was born, I was asked to limit visits to once a week. (We live about 4 miles apart.) This worked fine, and I certainly understand all the exhaustion that comes with a new baby. But a few months after the baby was born, I was right next to their apartment for a medical appointment and texted to ask if I could stop by for a cup of tea and bring pastries. I also voiced that I did not understand the need for complete rigidity, especially after months had gone by. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2024/09/parenting-advice-grandparent-visit-boundaries.html"&gt;Well, I got a big no …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This leads to a dangerous buildup of blood sugar and ketones, which can be life-threatening without treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What breakthrough did researchers make about leptin’s role in DKA?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;A: Scientists discovered that leptin, a hormone signaling energy sufficiency to the brain, can normalize blood sugar and ketone levels—even without insulin—by reprogramming the brain’s response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are the implications for diabetes care?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;A: If clinical trials succeed, leptin-based therapies could reduce or replace the need for daily insulin injections, revolutionizing type 1 diabetes management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A decade after an overlooked discovery, researchers now confirm that the hormone leptin can reverse diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) even without insulin. The brain, misled by low leptin into thinking the body lacks fuel, triggers a metabolic emergency — a core process in DKA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Administering leptin in rodents rebalanced glucose and ketone levels, proving the brain can stabilize blood sugar independently of insulin. These findings suggest type 1 diabetes may be treatable through the brain, challenging a century-old insulin-centric model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leptin as a Regulator:&lt;/strong&gt; Leptin informs the brain of energy sufficiency; low levels activate glucose and ketone production.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain-Driven DKA:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain’s misinterpretation of energy stores, not just insulin loss, drives DKA.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Therapies Ahead:&lt;/strong&gt; Leptin-based treatments may offer insulin-free management for type 1 diabetes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Washington&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than a decade ago, researchers found that an acute complication of type 1 diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), can be resolved with the hormone leptin, even in the absence of insulin.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis published&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;today in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Clinical Investigation&lt;/em&gt; explains how leptin affects the brain and how it might be used in future therapeutics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112055"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/leptin-type-1-diabetes-neurosciecne.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/leptin-type-1-diabetes-neurosciecne-300x233.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/leptin-type-1-diabetes-neurosciecne-770x599.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/leptin-type-1-diabetes-neurosciecne-293x228.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/leptin-type-1-diabetes-neurosciecne-150x117.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/leptin-type-1-diabetes-neurosciecne.jpg" alt="This shows a Brain and insulin syringes." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/leptin-type-1-diabetes-neurosciecne.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/leptin-type-1-diabetes-neurosciecne-300x233.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/leptin-type-1-diabetes-neurosciecne-770x599.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/leptin-type-1-diabetes-neurosciecne-293x228.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/leptin-type-1-diabetes-neurosciecne-150x117.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Leptin helps the brain regulate appetite and body weight. Leptin is produced by your body’s fat cells. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;DKA happens when the body is unable to make insulin and begins to break down fat for fuel. This can lead to a life-threatening buildup of sugar (glucose) and ketoacids in the blood. Doctors have typically administered insulin to address the complication, authors noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But evidence now shows that, when insulin is insufficient, the brain plays a key role in  driving DKA, according to the new analysis, based in literature and research that includes studies conducted at UW Medicine since 2011.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the pancreas can’t make insulin, “the brain gets the message that the body is out of fuel, even if it’s not. This information is being communicated in part by a low blood level of the hormone leptin,” said senior author Dr. Michael Schwartz, professor of medicine, Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology and Nutrition at the University of Washington School of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leptin helps the brain regulate appetite and body weight. Leptin is produced by your body’s fat cells. The hormone  is carried by the bloodstream into your brain, particularly an area called the hypothalamus. This is the part of your brain that controls when and how much you eat. Insufficient leptin leads the brain to activate circuits that mobilize energy sources, including glucose and ketones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz and his team discovered this connection in 2011 when they first administered leptin into the brain of rats and mice with type 1 diabetes. At first, nothing happened. But four days later, they were astonished when the animals’ blood glucose and ketone levels became completely normal, despite ongoing severe insulin deficiency.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the most amazing thing is that the blood sugars just didn’t come down, but that the levels stayed down,” he said. “If you tried to get them to rise, they came back down. If you tried to lower them, they came back up.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These responses suggested that the brain can maintain normal blood sugar levels even in the absence of insulin, Schwartz said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, the diabetes research community didn’t know what to make of the discovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We now have a much better understanding of a finding that was largely ignored by the scientific community when it was first reported in 2011,” Schwartz said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz said he will seek FDA approval to begin human trials to test whether leptin is capable of normalizing blood sugar levels in people with type 1 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positive results would open the door to pharmaceutical therapies for type 1 diabetes that target the brain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is one of the most exciting discoveries of my career,” said co-author Dr. Irl Hirsch, a UW Medicine’s diabetes treatment and teaching chair and a professor of metabolism, endocrinology and nutrition at the University of Washington School of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hirsch said controlling blood glucose with leptin could  unlock new avenues of treatment for patients.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Don’t get me wrong, discovering insulin 104 years ago is one of the greatest discoveries of the last century,” said Hirsch, who has had type 1 diabetes since childhood. “But this, this is the next step. This might be a better way.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz noted that insulin management is a substantial burden for patients and their families.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think if you could treat type 1 diabetes without daily insulin injections and blood sugar monitoring, patients would say that is the greatest thing ever,” he added.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the brain can be convinced that fuel stores are not depleted, or if specific brain neurons that trigger the production of glucose and ketones are turned off, the body stops the reaction that leads to severe hyperglycemia and DKA.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This new framework challenges that conventional wisdom about insulin deficiency as the sole cause of diabetic ketoacidosis that has been widely accepted for decades,” said Schwartz. “It shows that the brain plays a powerful role in the genesis of uncontrolled diabetes — and may hold the key to new treatments.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Funding for this research was supported by National Institutes of Health (grants DK083042, DK101997, DP2DK128802, DK089056, DK124238 and S10OD036208); the NIH-NIDDK funded Nutrition Obesity Research Center (NORC P30DK035816), Diabetes Research Center (DRC P30DK017047) and the Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism Training Grant (T32 DK007247) at the University of Washington; and the Department of Defense Peer-Reviewed Medical Research Program (W81XWH-20-1-0250).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diabetes and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#aecccfcd989eeedbd980cbcadb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Barbara Clements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uw.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Washington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Barbara Clements – University of Washington&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will be published in &lt;em&gt;JCI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 18:27:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE84d28ydml6RXBMQ0sxUlRQT0piVmxjR21BdUEtMEJaTWVfR0pwN0hKUXFlVl9JNGZaajFTdzRzNExpUEpOTEpBTFp4X0VVaDJpb0k3YnJTRlc3VzlZbjRueVNlWUxpMW50SmxYU2dUcnVhdw</guid></item><item><title>两个孩子的健康爸爸在家里闻到了漂白剂的味道，并假设他的妻子一直在打扫卫生。然后，他接受了毁灭性的诊断- AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTFAtZTRoWnNMZTIzOUV2clM4T2p2UF9IU2hzRGs5bkZYSFkwbUhwS2VHVWdwUFZCb3FpVjFIYTBzZ2FKbHRIaE1qX3lkX3luNlRWZnQ5NlJDWGxVUUpBZGFyUDF4YTBnZ0VBUnVWd01wY3I?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NEED TO KNOW&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dad of two was diagnosed with a brain tumor in February 2020 after experiencing "strange symptoms"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam Suriakumar, 40, said he’d been "smelling a strange smell and feeling really unwell" in the days leading up to his diagnosis with a glioma, describing the smell as "like ammonia or bleach"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suriakumar assumed his wife Sindhu, with whom he shares daughters Avaana, 10, and Arya, 8, had been cleaning the bathroom&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A British father of two is speaking out about receiving a devastating diagnosis after noticing he had some strange symptoms — which included randomly smelling bleach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam Suriakumar, now 40, was diagnosed with a glioma in February 2020 after having a seizure on the London Underground on his way home from work, according to the &lt;a href="https://braintumourresearch.org/blogs/latest-news/brain-tumour-research-supporter-ambassador-sam-suriakumar-celebrates-his-40th-birthday-with-a-moving-film-watch-it-here" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Brain Tumor Research website;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Brain Tumor Research website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21969-glioma" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, a "glioma is a tumor that forms in the brain or spinal cord."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are several types, including astrocytomas, ependymomas and oligodendrogliomas.

I now know this as a symptom or a warning sign called an ‘aura,'" he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14959431/inoperable-brain-tumour-symptoms.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Daily Mail;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the first time Suriakumar smelled the bleach, he assumed his wife, Sindhu, had been cleaning the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I felt like I needed to lean against the wall to stand, I felt very strange but didn't think much of it," he said of experiencing the symptoms, per the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suriakumar added, according to the Brain Tumor Research site, "The next day, when I was lifting a heavy weight at the gym, I experienced the same smell. I felt like I was going to collapse, and I had to put the weight down," sharing, "I didn’t know it was a trigger warning that something was going on in my brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He remembered going back to his office in central London, but "didn't feel right" and "couldn’t face sitting in front of a computer screen," so headed home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While on the subway, Suriakumar said he closed his eyes, but opened them "just two minutes later," despite it feeling "like so much time had passed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he'd "had a full tonic-clonic seizure on the tube," adding, "My seizure was so severe that I fell off my seat, and the contractions were so violent that I dislocated my shoulder."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suriakumar — who shares daughters Avaana, 10, and Arya, 8, with his wife Sindhu — wrote, "A member of the public had pulled the emergency lever on the tube, and I was taken off at Balham [London Underground station] where the station staff called an ambulance. Later, I was told I’d had another seizure in the ambulance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He explained that the doctors at St. George's Hospital, where he was taken, "didn't know" why he was having the seizures, as he'd "had no previous symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suriakumar recalled, "I had some scans and a lumbar puncture to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for analysis. At first, nothing really showed on the scan, but a further scan revealed a mass on my brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When they told me, I was devastated. I didn’t even understand those words. To me they just meant death with a zero per cent chance of fighting this," he continued, adding that "suddenly" his "life changed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I couldn’t work, I couldn’t drive, and my future was far from certain. It felt like life had stopped and I was in a dark tunnel with no light. I couldn’t speak, hear or understand what was going on," he shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suriakumar said that the COVID lockdown "soon followed" and he enjoyed some quality time with his wife, whom he married in 2011, and two girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After thanking people for their support, Suriakumar continued, "My brain [tumor] is a glioma and it was growing like a cobweb. This means it is difficult to remove with surgery without causing damage to the areas of my brain which control speech, memory, emotions and mobility."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that he was told if he "did have an operation, it would only be possible to remove 40% of the mass."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk: PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt;, Suriakumar was later told that his tumor had grown while he was at a wedding in Brazil in July 2023, after his condition had remained stable for two years. Not long after flying back to the U.K., he underwent surgery to have some of the tumor removed, the outlet noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In August 2023, I had a biopsy followed by a course of radiotherapy at the Royal Marsden in Sutton. I then underwent a year-long course of chemotherapy which finished in September 2024," Suriakumar shared with Brain Tumor Research, stating that he was "really sick during chemotherapy" and lost around 44 lbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Suriakumar has been working on his health, completing a fitness competition in Belgium in April of this year, as well as recently &lt;a href="https://braintumourresearch.org/blogs/latest-news/brain-tumour-research-supporter-ambassador-sam-suriakumar-celebrates-his-40th-birthday-with-a-moving-film-watch-it-here" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:celebrating his 40th birthday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;celebrating his 40th birthday&lt;/a&gt; on July 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I now have check-up scans every six months.

"When I was first diagnosed, my oncologist gave me a poor prognosis … I didn’t think I’d get to see my 40th, that’s the crude reality of living with a brain [tumor]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When I was first diagnosed, I didn’t even think I’d see the end of the week. Forty was always a big benchmark number because of the poor survival statistics for people with brain [tumors], so getting to celebrate it has been a massive dream for me," Suriakumar insisted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/healthy-dad-smelled-bleach-home-received-devastating-diagnosis-11783255" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 18:18:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFAtZTRoWnNMZTIzOUV2clM4T2p2UF9IU2hzRGs5bkZYSFkwbUhwS2VHVWdwUFZCb3FpVjFIYTBzZ2FKbHRIaE1qX3lkX3luNlRWZnQ5NlJDWGxVUUpBZGFyUDF4YTBnZ0VBUnVWd01wY3I</guid></item><item><title>研究表明， 4个北卡罗来纳州县的性病发病率是美国最高的县之一。查看完整列表-夏洛特观察家报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNUVNURTRYNjBucXE2bjhBelRjN0hYeW5tektWZk5oOWFCendhaC11NVh1WGhIRy1tREpUVmFQbVB2NTJaRjZORkp2dklpQ1ZxZGJyYXlSUXJRSzF0TXRRZ2tPZ1RSSlJZMHo3WjRDRGZJay0xN1M3d2xzWDkyX0ZnTW1aUUg0R2Rt?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="" class="paper story-body"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="trinityAudioPlaceholder trinity-player-iframe-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent report found that four counties in North Carolina are among the top 50 in the nation for highest sexually transmitted diseases (STD) infection rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.invigormedical.com/lifestyle/std-infection-rates-by-county-state/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The report from Invigor Medical&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a medical clinic based in Washington, gathered data on the number of HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia cases reported in each county.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It found that &lt;b&gt;Cumberland County&lt;/b&gt;

Rates drop with age across both sexes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Black Americans experience infection rates over seven times higher&lt;/b&gt; than White Americans, highlighting persistent racial healthcare disparities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The South reports the highest STD rates&lt;/b&gt;, particularly in Louisiana and Mississippi, while New York and South Dakota are notable regional outliers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;New England states have the lowest rates&lt;/b&gt;, likely due to older populations, higher incomes and better healthcare access.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;CDC data suggests the epidemic may be starting to level off&lt;/b&gt;, with recent signs of stabilization or slight decline in major STD rates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2"&gt;US counties with the highest STD rates&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These 10 counties have the highest STD rates in the nation, according to Invigor Medical:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-106" class="zone zone-el" index="14" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;St. Louis City, Missouri &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;District of Columbia, D.C. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hinds County, Mississippi&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Baltimore City, Maryland&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Orleans Parish, Louisiana&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Montgomery County, Alabama &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Norfolk City, Virginia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Richmond County, Georgia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Richmond City, Virginia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2"&gt;What to know about STD testing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti/prevention/index.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (CDC) emphasizes that getting tested for STDs is essential for understanding your health and preventing the spread of infections. Testing gives you the information you need to take protective steps — for yourself and partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk to your healthcare provider about which STD tests are right for you, and encourage your partner to get tested as well. It’s the only way to be sure you’re both covered, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-107" class="zone zone-el" index="18" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many STDs are simple to detect and treat. If one of you tests positive, it’s important that both partners receive treatment at the same time to avoid passing the infection back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2"&gt;How did Invigor Medical come up with its findings?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invigor Medical used data from the CDC on chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis and HIV to compile the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rankings reflect new cases per 100,000 residents, not total infections, with HIV data limited to those aged 13 and up. Only states and counties with full data and populations over 200,000 were included, with counties grouped by size for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-108" class="zone zone-el" index="22" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All CDC data referenced in the report is publicly available &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/about/?CDC_AAref_Val=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fstd%2Fstatistics%2Fdefault.htm"&gt;&lt;u&gt;online&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="embed-infographic"&gt;  &lt;gray-box&gt;  &lt;h3&gt;Ask the North Carolina Service Journalism Team &lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Have a question about your community you’d like answered?

It is often used to treat conditions where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He received treatment at two different hospitals.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After six weeks, the toddler was sent home with a feeding tube, a plan to slowly reduce the steroid dose he was receiving and his parents were asked to set up follow-up appointments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, in September 2024, the parents rushed him to Children’s Hospital LA in an ambulance as the toddler's symptoms continued to worsen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doctors at the hospital noticed the child was showing similar symptoms as the teenager and had a high white blood count, prompting them to suspect a B. procyonis infection. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;During an exam, doctors found the parasitic roundworm Baylisascaris procyonis in the toddler's eye and killed it with a focused laser.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both the teenager and toddler were treated for six weeks with albendazole (an anthelmintic drug that kills parasitic worms) and corticosteroids (an anti-inflammatory drug to manage symptoms like headaches and seizures). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;B. procyonis infection, also known as raccoon roundworm infection, is a parasitic disease caused by the roundworm Baylisascaris procyonis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7912011/whats-the-big-deal-about-sugar-we-have-your-questions-answered/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sugar may have a bad reputation&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not the primary cause of diabetes. In fact, type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes have completely different underlying causes. Type 1 diabetes is an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/having-one-autoimmune-condition-can-increase-your-chance-of-developing-others-heres-why-8402183" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;autoimmune disease&lt;/a&gt; in which the immune system attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, leading to little or no insulin production. Type 2 diabetes, on the other hand, is more complicated. It typically stems from a combination of factors such as genetics, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-have-insulin-resistance-8400321" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, body composition and lifestyle habits like diet and physical inactivity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Type 2 diabetes doesn’t have a single cause, especially not sugar alone. Diets high in ultra-processed foods, which often contain added sugars, fats and refined carbs, have been linked to insulin resistance and glucose dysregulation,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ina-flores" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Ina Flores, M.S., RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Although eating too much added sugar can play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes, it’s not a direct cause. “It’s not about one food or ingredient. It’s about the overall dietary pattern and metabolic health,” Flores says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A common misconception is that people with diabetes must &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8066203/habit-to-break-insulin-resistance/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;avoid carbohydrates altogether&lt;/a&gt;.

Fiber-rich carbohydrates like legumes, whole grains, fruit and vegetables are especially good choices. They digest more slowly,  support &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-break-for-blood-sugar-balance-11781367" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;glycemic control&lt;/a&gt; and provide &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/diabetes-vitamin-deficiency-study-8784014" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;essential vitamins and minerals&lt;/a&gt; that are important for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/newly-diagnosed-diabetes-8584338" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;diabetes management&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s also important to consider what you’re &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938733/healthiest-carbs-you-should-be-buying-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pairing with your carbs&lt;/a&gt;. “Combining carbs with protein, fat or fiber—like pairing fruit with nuts or crackers with cheese—can help slow digestion and keep blood sugar steadier,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamar-samuels-ms-rd-964311aa" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Tamar Samuels, M.S., RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although some people can manage type 2 diabetes with lifestyle changes alone, this isn’t possible for everyone. Diabetes is a chronic, progressive disease, which means your management plan can change over time. Insulin is the hormone that allows blood sugar to enter your cells, and in type 2 diabetes, the body’s ability to produce it can decline—even with healthy habits. When there isn’t enough insulin, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7894414/what-to-do-if-you-eat-too-much-sugar-when-you-have-diabetes/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blood sugar builds up&lt;/a&gt; and can cause damage throughout the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Taking insulin can be a life-saving tool to keep your blood sugar levels balanced—and isn’t a sign of failure. For people with type 1 diabetes, insulin is essential for survival, as their pancreas no longer produces it, regardless of lifestyle habits. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Starting an insulin regimen isn’t about giving up or failing, it’s about giving your body what it needs,” says Flores. “It’s a powerful, life-saving therapy.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s a common misconception that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/could-the-body-roundness-index-replace-bmi-8658684" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;body mass index (BMI)&lt;/a&gt; is a reliable measure of overall health. In reality, BMI doesn’t distinguish between muscle and fat or account for other contributing factors like genetics, ethnicity, environment, age and stress. For example, a person classified as “obese” based on BMI may have a healthy body composition with higher muscle mass and lower fat mass, while someone with a “normal” BMI may carry excess fat and have low muscle mass—putting them at greater risk for health issues.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, research suggests that central adiposity—fat stored around the abdomen—is a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8038155/research-testing-for-type-2-diabetes-at-physical-exam/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stronger predictor of diabetes risk&lt;/a&gt; than BMI.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Still, even individuals with a lower or “normal” BMI can develop type 2 diabetes. “It would be wrong to assume those in the normal range BMI category are protected from developing type 2 diabetes. We need to acknowledge other risk factors of blood sugar dysregulation and insulin resistance to avoid missed diagnoses,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/meredith-rofheart-ms-rd-cdn-251b4320a" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Meredith Rofheart, M.S., RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there isn’t currently a cure for diabetes—though hopefully there will be one day—it is possible to reach remission, meaning you can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290068/12-healthy-ways-to-lower-your-blood-sugar/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;manage your blood sugar levels without medication&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Remission is possible for some people with type 2 diabetes, especially after significant weight loss and early intervention, but it’s not a cure,” says Flores. “Maintaining remission requires ongoing lifestyle changes, regular medical follow-up and support. Weight regain or declining beta cell function can lead to relapse, so long-term support is essential.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although promising advancements are underway in the treatment of type 1 diabetes, it remains a nonreversible condition that requires ongoing medical management.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Despite the myths out there, there are many lifestyle habits that can help you effectively manage your diabetes.

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balance Your Plate.&lt;/strong&gt; Combine protein, healthy fats and fiber-rich carbs to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291843/these-are-the-fastest-ways-to-stabilize-your-blood-sugar-if-you-have-diabetes/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stabilize blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move More.&lt;/strong&gt; Staying physically active can help &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-for-better-blood-sugar-11681853" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;better manage blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt;. This includes activities like strength training, cardio, playing sports and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-time-to-exercise-for-healthy-blood-sugar-8776092" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;going for walks&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also important to reduce long sitting and sedentary time throughout the day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor Your Portions.&lt;/strong&gt; Being mindful of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8019115/what-are-portion-sizes-do-they-matter/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;portion sizes&lt;/a&gt; can help you manage your carbohydrate and calorie intake. A helpful guideline is to fill half of your plate with nonstarchy vegetables, one quarter with complex carbohydrates, and the remaining quarter with lean protein.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Screened Early.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/risk-factors-prediabetes-8733895" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;family history of diabetes&lt;/a&gt; or other risk factors, it’s important to speak with your health care provider. Early detection can help you take steps to prevent or delay complications.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work with a Professional.&lt;/strong&gt; A registered dietitian or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/newly-diagnosed-diabetes-8584338" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="6"&gt;certified diabetes care and education specialist (CDCES)&lt;/a&gt; can help personalize your plan that fits with your lifestyle and individual needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The myths around diabetes aren’t just wrong—they’re harmful. They can trap people in fear, shame and confusion—often delaying effective care. But here’s the truth: diabetes management isn’t about perfection or punishment. It’s about meeting people where they are—understanding their barriers, helping them navigate the emotional challenges of the condition and equipping them with the knowledge and skills necessary for self-care. Whether you’re trying to prevent, manage or simply understand diabetes better, replacing myths with facts can make all the difference.&lt;br&gt;

Most people might think, “they are probably just busy”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But someone with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) might spiral into a flood of thoughts like, “they must hate me!” or “I’ve ruined the friendship!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These intense emotional reactions to real or imagined rejection are part of what’s called rejection sensitive dysphoria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term isn’t a formal diagnosis, but it’s gaining traction in both research and clinical work, especially among adults seeking to understand themselves better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what is rejection sensitive dysphoria, how does it relate to ADHD, and how can we handle it with more compassion?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;It’s more than just disliking criticism&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone feels hurt when they’re criticised or left out. But rejection sensitivity dysphoria isn’t just about “not liking” feedback. The word dysphoria refers to intense emotional distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with rejection sensitivity dysphoria describe overwhelming reactions to perceived rejection, even if no one actually said or did anything cruel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A passing comment such as “I thought you were going to do it this way” can trigger feelings of shame, embarrassment or self-doubt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emotional pain often feels immediate and consuming, leading some people to withdraw, over-apologise or lash out to protect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The ADHD brain and emotional hypersensitivity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is often associated with attention or impulsivity, but one major (and often overlooked) component is emotional dysregulation: difficulty managing and recovering from strong emotional responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a character flaw; it’s a neurological difference. &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1087054713505322"&gt;Brain imaging studies show&lt;/a&gt; people with ADHD tend to have differences in how their amygdala (the brain’s emotional alarm system) and prefrontal cortex (which regulates impulses and emotions) work together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result? Emotional experiences hit harder and take longer to settle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884954/"&gt;2018 study&lt;/a&gt; highlights this imbalance in emotional control circuits in people with ADHD, explaining why intense feelings can seem to “take over” before logical thinking kicks in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the research say?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research from 2024 &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09388982241271511"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; a strong link between ADHD symptoms and rejection sensitivity. It found students with higher ADHD symptom levels also reported significantly more rejection sensitivity, including a heightened fear of being negatively evaluated or criticised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further evidence comes from a &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10802-018-0470-2"&gt;2018 study&lt;/a&gt; which showed adolescents with ADHD symptoms were far more sensitive to peer feedback than their peers. Their brain activity revealed they were more emotionally reactive to both praise and criticism, suggesting they may perceive neutral social cues as emotionally charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reflects what I see daily in my clinic. One 13-year-old boy I work with is creative, empathetic and full of potential, yet social anxiety tied to a deep fear of rejection often holds him back. He once told me, “if I say no, they won’t like me anymore”. That fear drives him to go along with things he later regrets, simply to keep the peace and avoid losing connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This constant social hypervigilance is mentally draining. Without support, it can spiral into shame, low confidence and ongoing mental health struggles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults with ADHD aren’t immune either. A &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0263366"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; explored how adults with ADHD experience criticism and found many linked it to persistent feelings of failure, low self-worth and emotional reactivity – even when the criticism was constructive or mild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One client I support – a high-achieving professional diagnosed in her 50s – described learning about rejection sensitive dysphoria as “finding the missing piece of the puzzle”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite consistently excelling in every role, she had long felt anxious about how she was perceived by colleagues. When she received a minor, formal complaint at work, she spiralled into intense self-doubt and shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of brushing it off, she thought: “I’m too much”. This belief&lt;br&gt; had been silently reinforced for years by her emotional sensitivity to feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What helps?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you experience rejection sensitivity dysphoria, you’re not alone, and you’re not broken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some tools that may help:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;name it&lt;/strong&gt;. Saying to yourself, “This feels like rejection sensitivity,” can give you distance from the emotional flood&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pause before reacting&lt;/strong&gt;. Taking slow breaths, counting backwards, or stepping outside are simple grounding strategies that help calm the body’s stress response and restore balance to your nervous system. &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/relaxation-techniques-breath-control-helps-quell-errant-stress-response"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; slowing your breath and grounding your senses can help shift your body out of fight-or-flight mode, supporting clearer thinking and emotional regulation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;challenge the story&lt;/strong&gt;. Ask yourself, “What else could be true?” or “How would I speak to a friend feeling this way?”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;consider therapy&lt;/strong&gt;. Working with a psychologist who understands ADHD and rejection sensitivity dysphoria can help untangle these reactions and develop healthy, self-compassionate responses. The Australian Psychological Society has a &lt;a href="https://psychology.org.au/find-a-psychologist"&gt;Find a Psychologist&lt;/a&gt; service: you can search by location, areas of expertise (such as anxiety, ADHD, trauma) and the type of therapy you’re interested in&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;start early with kids&lt;/strong&gt;. Helping children with ADHD learn emotional language, boundary-setting and resilience can prevent rejection sensitivity from becoming overwhelming. For parents, resources such as &lt;a href="https://raisingchildren.net.au/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=21566530992&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAADRtT2HFK1ba1H_RKXZiSPVddCphV&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwvajDBhCNARIsAEE29WqiIVE-xsfseKdiE2gXcz4tCq0rWZ3-wANekSvPRT0oS1DNFJU2kpcaAi_LEALw_wcB"&gt;Raising Children Network&lt;/a&gt; and books like &lt;a href="https://drdansiegel.com/book/the-whole-brain-child/"&gt;The Whole-Brain Child&lt;/a&gt; by Daniel Siegel and Tina Payne Bryson offer practical ways to teach these skills at home&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;communicate gently&lt;/strong&gt;. If you work or live with someone who has ADHD, try to give feedback clearly and kindly. Avoid sarcasm or vague phrasing. A little extra clarity can go a long way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rejection sensitivity dysphoria isn’t about being fragile or “weak”. It’s about how the ADHD brain processes emotional and social cues. With insight, tools and support, these experiences can become manageable.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/259995/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/259995/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

"With about 6 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber per ounce, almonds offer a powerful one-two punch that keeps you full and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-stable-blood-sugar-11758681" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;stabilizes blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;," says Lofton.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Almonds are calorie-dense on paper, but not all of those calories are available to the body. Their structure makes them harder to fully break down, which is good news if you’re trying to reduce visceral fat while still feeling full and nourished. If that sounds too good to be true, research confirms it. A 2023 review of the literature found that the metabolizable energy (the number of calories actually absorbed and used by the body) in whole almonds is about 20–25% lower than what’s listed on nutrition labels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Research also suggests that omega-3s increase fat burning in the liver, muscle and fat tissue, reducing fat storage in these areas.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fruits and vegetables. &lt;/strong&gt;Produce is high in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/surprising-antioxidant-rich-foods-you-should-eat-11776388" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fiber and antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are beneficial for reducing visceral fat. One study linked a 3.5-ounce daily increase in fruit and vegetable consumption to a reduction of two-thirds of an inch of visceral fat in women.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yogurt. &lt;/strong&gt;This dairy food is packed with protein and probiotics that may help reduce visceral fat by &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;supporting gut health&lt;/a&gt;, improving satiety and reducing inflammation.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Reducing visceral fat isn’t about restriction; it’s about routine," Lofton explains. "The good news? It responds well to everyday changes to how you eat, move and live."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a Mediterranean-style diet.&lt;/strong&gt; "A Mediterranean-style eating pattern, with vegetables, whole grains, legumes, olive oil and nuts like almonds, is one of the most effective ways to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292293/9-things-you-shouldnt-do-if-youre-trying-to-trim-belly-fat/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;target visceral fat&lt;/a&gt; and improve metabolic health," says Lofton.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit refined carbs.&lt;/strong&gt; "Avoid ultra-processed snacks and sugary drinks that spike insulin," says Jowett. Research shows that a higher intake of processed foods is associated with higher body fat, particularly visceral fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get moving. &lt;/strong&gt;You don’t need extreme workouts to get rid of visceral fat. Lofton recommends walking, short bursts of movement and consistency over time for a sustainable impact.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize quality sleep.&lt;/strong&gt; Even a single night of poor sleep can throw off your appetite-regulating hormones and reduce insulin sensitivity, which may lead to increased calorie intake and encourage your body to store more visceral fat rather than using it for energy.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Reducing visceral fat is important for lowering your risk of chronic conditions like cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. While there is no single magical food that will get rid of visceral fat, almonds offer a unique combination of nutrients that can help support your efforts. Enjoy them as part of a balanced diet along with other healthy habits like getting quality sleep, staying active and limiting your intake of highly processed foods.

For every single indication that people are using diphenhydramine, there are better drugs that are more effective at treating the symptoms people are trying to treat with fewer side effects,” she said. “I’ve had patients where I worried that diphenhydramine was impairing their ability to drive or fully participate in their daily lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Wolfson isn’t alone in preferring alternatives. In a &lt;a href="https://www.worldallergyorganizationjournal.org/article/S1939-4551(25)00002-X/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:review;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; published in February, allergy experts from Johns Hopkins University and the University of California, San Diego called for the removal of diphenhydramine from over-the-counter and prescription markets in the United States, saying it’s outdated, dangerous and eclipsed by safer alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A first-generation antihistamine approved in 1946, diphenhydramine is widely used for allergies, sleep aid and cold symptoms. It’s a common over-the-counter medication in the US, with usage rising in the summer months as people use it to treat itching from bug bites or poison ivy, as well as sneezing and runny nose caused by grass and pollen allergies, according to the American Pharmacists Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Despite its longstanding presence in American homes, the authors of the new review say it poses disproportionate risks, especially for children and older adults, than newer antihistamines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Patients should trial alternatives agents like loratadine, which is Claritin, or cetirizine, which is Zyrtec, or fexofenadine, which is Allegra,” to alleviate allergy symptoms, Dr. James Clark of the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the lead author of the paper, told CNN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents the OTC medicine industry, says that common side effects associated with products containing diphenhydramine are disclosed on the label. However, it notes, “these products are not intended for long-term use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“When used as directed, these medicines provide well-established therapeutic benefits for common health ailments like allergies, the common cold, motion sickness, minor skin irritations, and occasional sleeplessness,” the group said in a statement on behalf of Benadryl’s maker, Kenvue. “Like all medicines, responsible use is essential, and consumers should always follow directions and warnings on the Drug Facts labels and consult healthcare providers if they have questions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Risks of diphenhydramine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Antihistamines work by blocking receptors called H1, part of the body’s system for responding to allergens, which trigger symptoms like sneezing, itching and a runny nose. But older drugs like diphenhydramine don’t just block the allergy-related receptors, they can also affect other parts of the brain. Diphenhydramine often causes sedation, cognitive impairment, and in some cases, dangerous cardiac effects, the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In older adults, the drug can stay in the body for up to 18 hours, resulting in lingering sleepiness, disorientation and increasing risk of falling. The review also highlighted a possible link between long-term diphenhydramine use and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25621434/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In children, the risks can be even more pronounced. The review’s authors cite cases of accidental overdose; paradoxical reactions such as agitation, extreme sedation and coma; and even death, particularly with pediatric formulations, because of accidental ingestions. The medication was linked to several child hospitalizations and fatalities during the viral &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/us/benadryl-tiktok-challenge-teen-death-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:“Benadryl Challenge”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;“Benadryl Challenge”&lt;/a&gt; on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Manuela Murray, director of general pediatrics and urgent care at the University of Texas Medical Branch, says diphenhydramine “should not be used lightly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It should always be used under the guidance of a Medical Professional, and it is only indicated to treat allergic reactions and motion sickness,” Murray wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The medication is often misused and “doesn’t offer a benefit for treatment of cold symptoms, and it is not a safe sleep aid medication,” she said. In fact, it can have the opposite effects in children, leading to hyperactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Alyssa Kuban, a pediatrician and associate medical director at Texas Children’s Pediatrics, also said that she finds diphenhydramine overused for symptoms it does not directly treat and that there are safer alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I see some families use diphenhydramine when the child has a cold or upper respiratory infection, thinking it will help with the congestion and help them to sleep better at night,” she said. “This is not effective for cold symptoms, nor is it very safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She recommends over-the-counter cetirizine to treat children with hives, seasonal allergies or an itchy rash. Cetirizine is also longer-lasting and not as sedating as diphenhydramine, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Murray agrees that loratadine and cetirizine are safer for children over 6 months, and saline drops and suctioning are better alternatives for infants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;‘Time to say a final goodbye’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Diphenhydramine appears in over 300 OTC formulations, often blended into combination products for coughs, colds and flu. The authors of the review say that, like products with pseudoephedrine, diphenhydramine should at minimum be moved behind the counter, allowing pharmacists to guide patients toward second-generation alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The American Pharmacists Association says patients should use caution with combination cough and cold products that contain diphenhydramine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Pharmacists may recommend alternative medications for older adults who have a history of being cognitively affected by certain medications, the group says, and it “encourages patients and parents/caregivers to ask their pharmacist for the most appropriate treatment recommendation for their symptoms” with the least amount of side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The review authors also emphasize that there is no strong clinical data that may suggest that diphenhydramine works better than other options. Although it may reduce symptoms like sneezing and itching, it has minimal effect on nasal congestion and doesn’t outperform second-generation drugs in randomized trials. Newer options, such as oral cetirizine, offer 24-hour coverage with fewer adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, in the US, the medication remains a staple. According to the review, more than 1.5 million prescriptions are still written annually, not counting untracked OTC purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“In the past, it has been a useful medication that has helped millions of patients; however, its current therapeutic ratio is matched or exceeded by second-generation antihistamines, especially due to their markedly reduced adverse reactions. It is time to say a final goodbye to diphenhydramine, a public health hazard,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Home</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 15:11:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNclVsNTZTV1M2T1BMZXdzSnRwUTZPcXlnZU90aUxQNXZDU1A3MTRmRTNoWjRRQlNGbVZZS09yYks1VzExVGZJdGVDTXpmSjBXRzhtenQ5RUpMTU1EZWZKTEp4MlZwTFVjZm41TC1WN3RqMU81Y091aWk5OEl2SVRYU0lmeks0Yzh5c1VsSDlEYXAwdVdDMEE</guid></item><item><title>每天只喝一杯饮食苏打水可能会使您的2型糖尿病风险增加38 ％ - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxNVDNNZTJJQllmQVFETjNGanZGVkV6ZjV1aC1MSmR4V1M1cHJ6UXNDdDRPMnRMY1dzR2g1N2IzREhkS1ZWU25LUTFqdVFMWUMyeTFmemN1WGE3dlNVT3dWbnU0aEQwRWYzSWxjTVkweDdpX2RQckpUUzdtZmFQRnJYdTZsd3NFekdaSm5VX21GTVZPNnY3NW9vamdUdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Artificial sweeteners were introduced to offer a healthier alternative to sugar – but as a new study highlights, these substitutes bring their own health risks with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it doesn't take much of the stuff to make a difference: the researchers behind the study, from several institutions in Australia and the Netherlands, found that drinking just a single can of artificially sweetened soft drink a day over several years was associated with a 38 percent higher risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/soups-and-shakes-diet-can-put-type-2-diabetes-into-remission-study-finds"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, compared to people who rarely drank sweetened beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, that's higher than the 23-percent increase in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="169766" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; risk associated with sugar-sweetened drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings are based on the eating and drinking habits of 36,608 Australians aged between 40 and 69. Participants reported their artificial sweetener and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/research-shows-sugar-can-change-your-brain-here-s-how"&gt;sugar consumption&lt;/a&gt;, and their health records were then followed for an average of 14 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/heres-what-diet-soft-drink-could-be-doing-to-your-health-in-the-long-term?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Here's What 'Diet' Soft Drink Could Be Doing to Your Health in The Long Term&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;​​​​"Drinking one or more of these beverages each day – whether sweetened with sugar or artificial substitutes – was linked to a significantly higher chance of developing type 2 diabetes," &lt;a href="https://www.monash.edu/news/articles/one-can-of-artificially-sweetened-soft-drink-daily-may-increase-diabetes-risk-by-more-than-a-third"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Robel Hussen Kabthymer, nutritionist at Monash University in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, when body weight was factored in, the link between sugary drinks and type 2 diabetes disappeared – suggesting &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fat-cells-seem-to-cling-to-the-memory-of-being-obese-study-finds"&gt;being overweight&lt;/a&gt; was driving that particular association. When body weight was factored into the artificial sweetener link, however, the increased risk was still present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/caffeine-in-your-blood-could-affect-body-fat-and-diabetes-risk-study-reveals"&gt;so many known contributors&lt;/a&gt; to type 2 diabetes risk, the researchers can't say artificial sweeteners are causing it directly. &lt;span&gt;All the data shows is that a link exists, but further investigation is needed to unpack it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169769" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169769" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/SpoonSugar.jpg" alt="Sugar in a bowl" class="wp-image-169769 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/SpoonSugar.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/SpoonSugar-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/SpoonSugar-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169769" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Artificial sweeteners are often marketed as healthier alternatives to sugar.

With different artificial sweeteners sold in different countries, and different eating and drinking habits across the globe, it's important to gather as much data as possible on potential risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Artificial sweeteners are often recommended to people at risk of diabetes as a healthier alternative, but our results suggest they may pose their own health risks," &lt;a href="https://www.monash.edu/news/articles/one-can-of-artificially-sweetened-soft-drink-daily-may-increase-diabetes-risk-by-more-than-a-third"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Barbora de Courten, biomedical scientist at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suspect that certain artificial sweeteners could be interfering with blood sugar levels, in turn contributing to an increased type 2 diabetes risk. For example, the widely used sweetener aspartame has &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2010.03.009"&gt;previously been shown&lt;/a&gt; to trigger the same insulin response as sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, other sweeteners &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature13793"&gt;are known to&lt;/a&gt; disrupt gut bacteria, increasing glucose intolerance in the body. These kinds of interactions and others could well be increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes, even in people who aren't gaining weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers want to see more done to raise awareness of the possible health hazards of artificial sweeteners. In recent years, research has also linked these sugar substitutes to problems with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-sweetener-could-damage-critical-brain-barrier-risking-stroke"&gt;brain integrity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-how-this-artificial-sweetener-may-cause-heart-damage"&gt;heart damage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We support measures like sugary drink taxes, but our study shows we also need to pay attention to artificially sweetened options," &lt;a href="https://www.monash.edu/news/articles/one-can-of-artificially-sweetened-soft-drink-daily-may-increase-diabetes-risk-by-more-than-a-third"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; de Courten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are often marketed as better for you, yet may carry their own risks. Future policies should take a broader approach to reducing intake of all non-nutritive beverages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabet.2025.101665"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diabetes &amp;amp; Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;United States kindergarten vaccination rates decreased last year while exemptions rose to an all-time high, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;new federal data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data, posted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website Thursday, showed vaccination coverage among kindergartners during the 2024 to 2025 school year decreased for all reported vaccines from the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the data, about 92.1% kindergartners got the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP), and 92.5% received the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) and polio vaccine — all down slightly from the previous school year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These decreases come as the U.S. has recorded the most &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-us-map/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;measles cases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in more than 30 years. A large share of the infections were connected to a West Texas outbreak primarily affecting children and teenagers, nearly all of whom were unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say outbreaks like these are more likely when vaccination rates drop — and rates have &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-vaccination-rates-us-counties-study/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;already fallen below&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreaks-vaccination-rate-herd-immunity/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;95% needed for herd immunity.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exemptions among U.S. kindergartners also rose to an all-time high during the 2024 to 2025 school year, the data showed, increasing to 3.6% from 3.3% the year before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C., with 17 states reporting exemptions exceeding 5%, the CDC added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking on &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/measles-outbreak-grows-to-nearly-100-cases-with-largest-impact-in-texas/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;"CBS Mornings"&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year about the measles outbreak, Dr. Céline Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, expressed worry over &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-measles-mmr-vaccine-symptoms/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;exemption increases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; across the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're really seeing a lot of exemptions [and] concerns about vaccination that are not warranted," she said, adding, for most people, the MMR vaccine will protect you for life against measles, one of the most contagious infectious diseases. Doctors and public health officials say the vaccine, which has been used for decades, is safe and highly effective.&lt;/p&gt;
