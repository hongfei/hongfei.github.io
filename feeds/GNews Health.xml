As of 2024, about one in nine people aged 65 and older were living with the disease in the U.S.—that’s almost 7 million Americans. Unfortunately, there isn't a cure for Alzheimer’s. And while some researchers are looking for solutions, others are focusing their efforts on ways to prevent the disease from developing in the first place—or at least slow it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we know that no one food is a magic solution for any disease, some foods can be heavy hitters when it comes to disease prevention. For a recent study, researchers in South America and Denmark got together and performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on kefir, a kind of fermented milk that originated in the Balkans and Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team chose to look deeper into kefir because there is evidence that a healthy gut microbiome may play a role in Alzheimer’s disease prevention. We know that foods like kefir contribute probiotics, those gut-loving bacteria. And it turns out, kefir contributes more than just that. These researchers published their findings in April 2025 in &lt;em&gt;Brain Behavior and Immunity Integrative&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s break down what they found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fermented-foods-for-brain-health-8729105" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The 6 Best Fermented Foods for Brain Health, According to Dietitians;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The 6 Best Fermented Foods for Brain Health, According to Dietitians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Was This Study Conducted?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study authors searched research databases for studies that had been done on kefir and neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases include Alzheimer’s disease, as well as others, like Parkinson’s disease, Lewy body dementia and Huntington’s disease. They then began whittling down the list of studies to just those that included data on kefir and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They ended up with seven studies—four on rodents (rats and mice), two on fruit flies and one on humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Did This Review Find?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several findings surfaced between these seven studies. Specifically, researchers found that subjects who had consumed kefir had:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;less beta-amyloid protein accumulation in the brain (four of the studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;higher antioxidant activity and reduced oxidative damage (five studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;reductions in neuro-inflammation (three studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;lower levels of brain cell death (three studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;enhanced insulin and glucose pathways in the brain (three studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;restoration of the intestinal lining (two studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the human study specifically, kefir was associated with higher levels of antioxidant activity and better performance on several memory tests for people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Study Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This systematic review and meta-analysis included just one human study. Because non-human studies do not always translate to the same results in humans, we cannot say with a high degree of certainty that these results apply to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers note that because kefir can differ in composition, depending on how it’s made, it presents a significant limitation when comparing the results of different studies on kefir’s benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also note that larger, long-term human studies need to be performed to understand the safety and effectiveness of kefir as a complementary therapy alongside drugs taken for Alzheimer’s disease. This means that, based on current research, they cannot confidently say whether kefir is helpful or safe alongside other treatments for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Does This Apply to Real Life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you aren’t concerned about your Alzheimer’s risk, kefir may still be a gut-healthy beverage &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-late-night-drink-for-weight-loss-11696463" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:worth adding to your routine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;worth adding to your routine&lt;/a&gt;. Plain kefir is a bit more sour-tasting than plain yogurt, but it’s a great addition to smoothies since it doubles as the liquid and is a probiotic. But that’s not all kefir contributes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to these researchers, kefir is also loaded with other healthy components, including protein, unsaturated fatty acids, carbohydrates and a wealth of vitamins and minerals, including vitamins A, D, E and K, B vitamins, calcium, phosphorus, potassium and zinc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the carbohydrates in kefir are complex carbohydrates, which feed the beneficial bacteria in the kefir and your gut, helping them to thrive and multiply. And if you’re lactose intolerant, there’s a chance your gut can tolerate kefir, since the process of making it reduces the amount of lactose to almost nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If plain kefir makes you pucker, you can find sweetened, flavored versions of kefir, usually in fruity flavors on the yogurt aisle. Just beware the sugar content, since many flavored varieties average around 8 grams of added sugar in an 8-ounce serving. With that said, if you don’t eat a lot of added sugar, this easily fits within the American Heart Association’s recommendation of limiting added sugar to no more than 25 grams a day for women and 36 grams a day for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kefir also comes in various levels of fat, depending on what type of milk was used to make it—from low-fat to whole-milk. And there are other varieties, including organic, grass-fed and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8032910/a2-milk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:A2 kefir made from A2 milk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;A2 kefir made from A2 milk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t do dairy? There’s something for you, too, since kefir can also be made from non-dairy milks. You’re most likely to see non-dairy kefir made from coconut milk, but you may also find it made from soy and oat milks. There’s even &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/265892/water-kefir/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:water kefir;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;water kefir&lt;/a&gt; that you can make yourself by purchasing water kefir grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use kefir in any of your favorite smoothie recipes, including options like our &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/257793/berry-kefir-smoothie/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Berry-Kefir Smoothie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Berry-Kefir Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;. Plain kefir can be used in place of buttermilk in your favorite baked goods, including pancakes, waffles and muffins. It can also be used as the buttermilk base of dressings, like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8045018/homemade-ranch-dressing/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ranch dressing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ranch dressing&lt;/a&gt;. Or replace the milk in your mac and cheese recipe with plain kefir for an added probiotic boost. And of course, you can also sip it on its own. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Your Gut Health Affects Almost Every System in Your Body—Are You Doing Enough to Care for It?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Your Gut Health Affects Almost Every System in Your Body—Are You Doing Enough to Care for It? &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating probiotic foods like kefir that enhance the gut microbiome is showing promise in playing a positive role in Alzheimer’s disease prevention. However, much more human research needs to be done. Until then, following an eating pattern like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-mind-diet-meal-plan-for-cognitive-health-11700108" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the MIND diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the MIND diet&lt;/a&gt;, which includes foods that have been shown to benefit brain health, is a good place to start. Besides fermented foods like kefir and yogurt, the MIND diet is also loaded with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds and healthy fats. It also includes lean proteins like chicken and seafood, and limits ultra-processed foods, red meat, sugar and salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to food, other habits also play a role in brain health. If you smoke, get help to quit. Alcohol &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-drink-to-limit-to-reduce-dementia-risk-8743556" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:isn’t great for your brain health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;isn’t great for your brain health&lt;/a&gt;, so if you don’t drink, don’t start. If you do, limit your intake to no more than one or two drinks a day—though less is probably better. Loneliness is also a risk factor for dementia, so be sure you’re spending time with loved ones on a regular basis. Good sleep and regular exercise can help you out, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that list seems overwhelming, take a deep breath and try improving just one thing at a time. Start with walking around the block a couple of days a week or limiting screen time before bed for better sleep. Small steps can lead to big changes when it comes to your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/kefir-alzheimers-study-11707164" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 00:05:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTFBmeHA0RE10NnZsRXdYRmZsTVpzdWdYZGdyTkJNUUpDNGFOSWk2X1ZNeEZjUksxX1B0NGhYeHoydXdnWUpZcTc1YXcwUlRhRHd6S045R2JVZ1RNUUNjSzhlOWZvZHZaR2c2MEJuTUxmellPUElHRUE</guid></item><item><title>Kent County records first measles case in 12 years - WOODTV.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxNZVZBaGRyRVFzcEhackhHZU0wcDZBcUoybC1USEVDbllGVG41Q2pkQnBjYmtBNEw4eHFiTnlKVWQxWjBWMmxGOE5DUVY4cmpYczB0bnlvUWFxaG8yWXZlU3hTbXE1dC1ydkJVVHgySTE0ZUFGOVVEUUJLUmxxbWNtcmRwam9reXRuSnZkel9lR0NRYUtiRkHSAZsBQVVfeXFMUDVCSWVvRDQtVjRkNHpBMzc0TE0zLTdXRE1ZYk55MkdFQlFRLVA1ZGlDMGZmanlOMHJMUmdRZFZSTkwzWHNEaHNWWkd6TFZqQ096Uy1aVjBNeEF6TGM3MzUyZDF1TmdUZHNBWFlEVjdSbHpLd3RDWGdJUlZrNW5PeHlHbUdNNHh3TFNnclF3czg2TkN3R3d2d0p0TjQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

But it’s not just a matter of getting enough rest. Sleeping late and less than five hours a day can impact your health in various ways. Dr Dheeraj Kapoor, head of endocrinology at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, Mumbai, tells Lata Mishra why getting your daily dose of shuteye is important&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How does poor sleep affect metabolism and blood sugar regulation?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor sleep quality and sleep deprivation are two critical factors that contribute to conditions like Type 2 diabetes, obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and fatty liver disease. Sleep deprivation, defined as getting less than 7-8 hours of sleep, and disrupted sleep quality, where a person frequently wakes up at night, both increase the risk of metabolic disorders. When sleep is compromised, the body produces excess cortisol, a stress hormone that heightens insulin resistance and increases the risk of diabetes. Additionally, hormonal imbalances occur — ghrelin (the hunger hormone) rises while leptin (which signals fullness) decreases, leading to increased appetite and cravings for high-calorie foods. Sleep deprivation also triggers inflammation and oxidative stress, further contributing to metabolic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Can just one night of poor sleep impact us?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While chronic sleep deprivation has a more profound impact, some studies indicate that even one night of poor sleep can elevate cortisol levels which, in turn, increases insulin resistance and the risk of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why is sleeping less than five hours and going to bed late harmful?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This combination disrupts the body’s circadian rhythm, the internal 24-hour clock that regulates sleep, hormone secretion, and metabolic processes. When sleep duration is too short and occurs too late at night, cortisol production rises, insulin sensitivity decreases, and metabolic disorders become more likely. Night-shift workers and those who regularly stay up late are at higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome due to these disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;If someone gets eight-plus hours of sleep but goes to bed late, are they still at risk for metabolic issues?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. While getting adequate sleep is beneficial, the timing of sleep also matters. Sleeping after midnight disrupts the circadian rhythm which regulates physiological processes, including sleep, hormone secretion, and metabolism. It helps control insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. When disrupted — due to irregular sleep schedules, shift work, or sleeping late — metabolic processes get impaired, leading to increased risks of diabetes and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Do late sleepers tend to have poorer glucose control?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their disrupted circadian rhythms affect insulin function and glucose metabolism. They also tend to have irregular eating patterns, increased cravings for high-calorie foods, and higher cortisol levels, all of which contribute to poor glucose control. Night-time eating habits further exacerbate insulin resistance, increasing the risk of metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What about other disorders like PCOS, fatty liver disease, or high cholesterol? Are they caused by poor sleep too?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Poor sleep affects hormone balance, leading to increased insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction, which play key roles in conditions like PCOS, fatty liver disease, and high cholesterol. Sleep deprivation also promotes weight gain and inflammation, both of which contribute to these metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Can exercise reduce the impact of sleep loss on insulin sensitivity?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Exercise, particularly high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and strength training, can help reduce some of the negative effects of sleep loss by improving insulin sensitivity and metabolic function. However, exercise should ideally be done in the morning, afternoon, or early evening rather than right before bedtime, as late-night workouts can increase adenosine levels and interfere with sleep quality. Also, reducing screen time before bed and avoiding caffeinated drinks can further support better sleep quality and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why does caffeine consumption disrupt sleep more as we age?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant that blocks adenosine, a chemical that promotes sleep. As individuals age, the body’s ability to metabolise caffeine slows down, making its effects last longer. Older adults are also more sensitive to sleep disturbances, meaning even a small amount of caffeine consumed in the evening can lead to prolonged wakefulness and fragmented sleep. Additionally, age-related changes in sleep patterns, such as lighter sleep and increased awakenings, make the effects of caffeine more pronounced. It is recommended that older adults reduce caffeine intake in the afternoon and evening to improve sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What are some effective strategies for improving sleep hygiene?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good sleep hygiene involves adopting healthy habits that promote restful sleep. Some effective strategies include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining a consistent sleep schedule: Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends, helps regulate the body’s internal clock.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creating a comfortable sleep environment: Keeping the bedroom dark, quiet, and cool can enhance sleep quality. Using blackout curtains, white noise machines, and comfortable bedding can help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoiding stimulants before bedtime: Caffeine, nicotine, and heavy meals should be avoided in the evening to prevent sleep disturbances.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Engaging in relaxation techniques: Meditation, deep breathing exercises, or light stretching before bed can help relax the mind and body.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting regular physical activity: Exercising during the day promotes better sleep, but vigorous workouts should be avoided close to bedtime.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9gFBVV95cUxQMW1sWHdqSHdQNkNJT2JtMnI0Y1NwaDBnTDBFT08xOTFGWXVnTUZXX2lrVnIwR2tqMkhjN3gtYzZ2UUR3MzBrdGdnaEV3eWhaRUpXR0daT1B3ZXg0WFptcHhUSTBGMVhGak5zMEZqVklybVIwWXZycWhuMFFXRl9tcDQ0b05meThvQjNLSTd5MWFPQURvbDNValJNVmR2bWgtZTEtd2hXYllWaTNvanoyQUlqXzg0NHpURXJnV1Juak5EYWpwTVBsSV9pTDhoa3hDejBrQ3hlcUVxSjluN0F3Z1hVci1Ib0xMQjRiMDJtWTlKYUk4alE</guid></item><item><title>This Underrated Drink Could Help Slow the Progression of Alzheimer’s, New Study Says - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTE1BdzVBMlV3Qm1FcnhBSkJRRFVvRElkUlFWWnBQMjdZUzJObElhdE5vSnI5UWhmaDR3bENjUHIzWklyVGEwM29tbmZ4Qzkwa0w1U3BWVUExMld6dWhTNEtnTDdBbjA4dnFaSXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-blockquote" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Study authors searched research databases for studies that had been done on kefir and neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases include Alzheimer’s disease, as well as others, like Parkinson’s disease, Lewy body dementia and Huntington’s disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They then began whittling down the list of studies to just those that included data on kefir and Alzheimer’s disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; They ended up with seven studies—four on rodents (rats and mice), two on fruit flies and one on humans. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-review-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Review Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Several findings surfaced between these seven studies. Specifically, researchers found that subjects who had consumed kefir had: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;less beta-amyloid protein accumulation in the brain (four of the studies)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;higher antioxidant activity and reduced oxidative damage (five studies)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;reductions in neuro-inflammation (three studies)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;lower levels of brain cell death (three studies)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;enhanced insulin and glucose pathways in the brain (three studies)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;restoration of the intestinal lining (two studies)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In the human study specifically, kefir was associated with higher levels of antioxidant activity and better performance on several memory tests for people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-generic" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading"&gt;Study Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This systematic review and meta-analysis included just one human study. Because non-human studies do not always translate to the same results in humans, we cannot say with a high degree of certainty that these results apply to humans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers note that because kefir can differ in composition, depending on how it’s made, it presents a significant limitation when comparing the results of different studies on kefir’s benefits. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers also note that larger, long-term human studies need to be performed to understand the safety and effectiveness of kefir as a complementary therapy alongside drugs taken for Alzheimer’s disease. This means that, based on current research, they cannot confidently say whether kefir is helpful or safe alongside other treatments for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even if you aren’t concerned about your Alzheimer’s risk, kefir may still be a gut-healthy beverage &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-late-night-drink-for-weight-loss-11696463" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;worth adding to your routine&lt;/a&gt;. Plain kefir is a bit more sour-tasting than plain yogurt, but it’s a great addition to smoothies since it doubles as the liquid and is a probiotic. But that’s not all kefir contributes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to these researchers, kefir is also loaded with other healthy components, including protein, unsaturated fatty acids, carbohydrates and a wealth of vitamins and minerals, including vitamins A, D, E and K, B vitamins, calcium, phosphorus, potassium and zinc.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many of the carbohydrates in kefir are complex carbohydrates, which feed the beneficial bacteria in the kefir and your gut, helping them to thrive and multiply. And if you’re lactose intolerant, there’s a chance your gut can tolerate kefir, since the process of making it reduces the amount of lactose to almost nothing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If plain kefir makes you pucker, you can find sweetened, flavored versions of kefir, usually in fruity flavors on the yogurt aisle. Just beware the sugar content, since many flavored varieties average around 8 grams of added sugar in an 8-ounce serving. With that said, if you don’t eat a lot of added sugar, this easily fits within the American Heart Association’s recommendation of limiting added sugar to no more than 25 grams a day for women and 36 grams a day for men.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kefir also comes in various levels of fat, depending on what type of milk was used to make it—from low-fat to whole-milk. And there are other varieties, including organic, grass-fed and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8032910/a2-milk/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;A2 kefir made from A2 milk&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Don’t do dairy? There’s something for you, too, since kefir can also be made from non-dairy milks. You’re most likely to see non-dairy kefir made from coconut milk, but you may also find it made from soy and oat milks. There’s even &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/265892/water-kefir/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;water kefir&lt;/a&gt; that you can make yourself by purchasing water kefir grains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Use kefir in any of your favorite smoothie recipes, including options like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/257793/berry-kefir-smoothie/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Berry-Kefir Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;. Plain kefir can be used in place of buttermilk in your favorite baked goods, including pancakes, waffles and muffins. It can also be used as the buttermilk base of dressings, like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8045018/homemade-ranch-dressing/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Ranch dressing&lt;/a&gt;. Or replace the milk in your mac and cheese recipe with plain kefir for an added probiotic boost. And of course, you can also sip it on its own. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating probiotic foods like kefir that enhance the gut microbiome is showing promise in playing a positive role in Alzheimer’s disease prevention. However, much more human research needs to be done. Until then, following an eating pattern like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-mind-diet-meal-plan-for-cognitive-health-11700108" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the MIND diet&lt;/a&gt;, which includes foods that have been shown to benefit brain health, is a good place to start. Besides fermented foods like kefir and yogurt, the MIND diet is also loaded with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds and healthy fats. It also includes lean proteins like chicken and seafood, and limits ultra-processed foods, red meat, sugar and salt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to food, other habits also play a role in brain health. If you smoke, get help to quit. Alcohol &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-drink-to-limit-to-reduce-dementia-risk-8743556" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;isn’t great for your brain health&lt;/a&gt;, so if you don’t drink, don’t start. If you do, limit your intake to no more than one or two drinks a day—though less is probably better. Loneliness is also a risk factor for dementia, so be sure you’re spending time with loved ones on a regular basis. Good sleep and regular exercise can help you out, too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If that list seems overwhelming, take a deep breath and try improving just one thing at a time. Start with walking around the block a couple of days a week or limiting screen time before bed for better sleep. Small steps can lead to big changes when it comes to your health.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

These cells produce IGF-1, a protein critical for forming the myelin sheath that helps nerve signals travel efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both mice and preterm infants exposed to maternal inflammation, researchers found decreased levels of IGF-1 and delayed myelination on MRI scans. The findings suggest a potential therapeutic target to protect infant brain development and reduce the long-term effects of prenatal inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Cells Affected:&lt;/strong&gt; Maternal inflammation reduces CD11c-positive microglia during development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myelination Delays:&lt;/strong&gt; Lower IGF-1 levels linked to disrupted myelin formation in infants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting microglia may prevent long-term neurodevelopmental delays.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Nagoya University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A research group led by Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine in Japan has uncovered a potential mechanism linking maternal inflammation to delayed neurodevelopment in infants. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research suggests the role of CD11c-positive microglia—immune cells in the brain crucial for myelination—during infant brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108344"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a baby's face and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mia-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;When they performed MRI of the infants, the scans confirmed that they had a higher incidence of delayed myelination.   Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results, published in &lt;em&gt;Communications Biology&lt;/em&gt;, suggest new strategies to mitigate the long-term neurodevelopmental effects of maternal inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation during pregnancy occurs when the mother’s immune system becomes activated during pregnancy, typically due to an infection, autoimmune response, or environmental factors. It can have negative outcomes for the baby, potentially causing long-term cognitive and behavioral challenges.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a research team led by Kazuya Fuma and Tomomi Kotani has discovered the role of CD11c-positive microglia in this process. Microglia, the brain’s immune cells, play a key role in myelination, the process where nerve fibers are coated with myelin. Myelin is essential for making the nerve cells able to transmit electrical signals efficiently.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the researchers tested mice that were exposed to maternal inflammation. They found that the proliferation of these cells was reduced. Then, to determine if these findings were relevant to humans, the researchers analyzed cord blood from preterm infants exposed to chorioamnionitis, a condition that causes inflammation during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found lower levels of IGF-1, a protein linked to CD11c-positive microglia, in their samples. When they performed MRI of the infants, the scans confirmed that they had a higher incidence of delayed myelination.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Inflammation during pregnancy suppressed the increase in CD11c microglia that we usually see during typical infant development,” Fuma said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CD11c microglia have been reported to be involved in myelination by being a major source of IGF-1. In the present study, both were decreased in inflammation during pregnancy, suggesting that this pathway is impaired in children with delayed neurodevelopment.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study sheds light on the complex relationship between maternal inflammation and neurodevelopment. The researchers hope that understanding the role of CD11c-positive microglia in neurodevelopment will lead to new therapeutic strategies.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If future studies confirm a decrease in these microglia in preterm infants exposed to inflammatory conditions, such as chorioamnionitis, early interventions could be developed to prevent or reduce the neurodevelopmental impact of maternal inflammation,” Fuma said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By targeting CD11c-positive microglia, it may be possible to protect infants from the long-term consequences of impaired myelination and improve their chances for healthy cognitive development.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this maternal inflammation and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#eb8288848686b4998e988e8a998883ab9fc5868a8287c5858a8c84928ac69ec58a88c5819b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Matthew Coslett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nagoya-u.ac.jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nagoya University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Matthew Coslett – Nagoya University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-07511-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Prenatal Inflammation Impairs Early CD11c-Positive Microglia Induction and Delays Myelination in Neurodevelopmental Disorders&lt;/a&gt;” by Kazuya Fuma et al. &lt;em&gt;Communications Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prenatal Inflammation Impairs Early CD11c-Positive Microglia Induction and Delays Myelination in Neurodevelopmental Disorders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Histological chorioamnionitis (HCA) is a form of maternal immune activation (MIA) linked to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our previous study identified neurodevelopmental impairments in an MIA mouse model mimicking HCA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, this study investigated the role of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia, key contributors to myelination through IGF-1 production, in this pathology. In the mouse model, the CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglial population was significantly lower in the MIA group than in the control group on postnatal day 3 (PN3d).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, myelination-related protein levels significantly decreased in the MIA group at PN8d. In humans, preterm infants with HCA exhibited higher IL-6 and IL-17A cord-serum levels and lower IGF-1 levels than those without HCA, followed by a higher incidence of delayed myelination on magnetic resonance imaging at the term-equivalent age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In silico analysis revealed that the transient induction of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia during early development occurred similarly in mice and humans. Notably, a lack of high CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglial population has been observed in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study reports impaired induction of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia during postnatal development in a mouse model of MIA associated with delayed myelination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings may inform strategies for improving outcomes in infants with HCA.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 21:58:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPM1ZGYWJtM205ZjhGQVJCSTI2alpSbW9lSWVNbl9icGkxS2ZfUy1jajF2WjhQQ0dBQlU0a0RkX3cxNzNUVmJsbXpwVi0yclk4R2lDcU41czlEZHVoeWdlYjl1M0tCQnRGT2tyd095VmZyNVFCR3BvNXhrNUlDMlVCc1hvRHVobnRJ</guid></item><item><title>Dozens of free measles vaccine clinics close in Texas as federal funding is cut - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxQZ3ZLNFcxdkExVDRBa25VaWhVUWNWand5dXkzTjhXY2FyeVdEMkpnTFBubzgyX1NfQWdxRWpsSHJCOUx4WThHTDMwQ3ZtT3dMTFM3QlhOS0VRalhnc0FETVlTbWJYY2lkeDE0SkFFd0FqNkZCT3diSHRNam9DazdwUEJMemVyOEY5RGEzVHp3Z0Vyb0M0RFdyb3RHQTZFSXB6R0k0dllZNGVPbUdLZlHSAVZBVV95cUxOVmVVZTE1R1pJeUE3Q2dScjRJZkplN0xCQWl3aU9iNHlDaUc2SUkyaVUtdlYzWHNxYWp2d3I4U3RsT0NyMzVhRmtEei0xSDFsb0kwZ2ltdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-pulling-back-11b-covid-funding-sent-health-departments-us-rcna198006" target="_blank"&gt;Steep federal funding cuts &lt;/a&gt;have forced public health officials in one of Texas’ most populous counties — Dallas — to cancel dozens of vaccination clinics and lay off 21 workers on the front lines of combatting the state’s growing measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I just had to tell our commissioners this morning that we’ve had to cancel over 50 different clinics in our community,” said Dr. Philip Huang, director and health authority for the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department. Many of the clinics had been planned for schools in areas with low vaccination rates, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The vaccines, which included measles, mumps and rubella shots, were meant to be given free to families. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The money being cut — $11.4 billion nationwide — was originally allocated to aid community health departments during the pandemic. Local public health officials have more recently been using the Covid funds for other public health initiatives, such as measles prevention, surveillance and testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Last week however, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that it would “&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-pulling-back-11b-covid-funding-sent-health-departments-us-rcna198006" target="_blank"&gt;no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars&lt;/a&gt; responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“That’s very short-sighted and not understanding of the way public health works,” Huang said. “Being prepared for Covid helps build our capacity to be able to respond to other issues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Huang said his team was still assessing the exact amount of money slashed in his budget, but estimated it to be in the millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;As of Tuesday, 422 measles had been reported by the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/a&gt;. None are in Dallas County, but Huang said the cuts would leave his community vulnerable to cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Eleven full-time and 10 part-time staffers were let go, he said. The majority were health care providers giving vaccines, epidemiologists and lab staff involved with measles surveillance and prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Staff operating vaccine clinics in West Texas, which remains the epicenter of the measles outbreak, said those clinics are continuing as planned for now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Other states reporting measles outbreaks include Kansas with 23 cases, Oklahoma with 10 cases, and New Mexico with 48 cases.

MDGA2 typically keeps BDNF/TrkB signaling in check, but when MDGA2 levels drop, heightened neuronal activity and social impairments occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice with reduced MDGA2 showed behaviors resembling autism, including repetitive grooming and social withdrawal. Treatment with a peptide that mimics MDGA2 restored balance and eased symptoms, suggesting a potential pathway for future autism therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein Imbalance:&lt;/strong&gt; Low MDGA2 disrupts BDNF/TrkB signaling, triggering ASD-like symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Changes:&lt;/strong&gt; Affected mice showed repetitive behaviors and social deficits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Mimicking MDGA2 reduced symptoms, pointing to new treatment avenues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In mice, autism symptoms arise when a certain pair of competing nerve proteins falls out of equilibrium, according to a study published April 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt; by Dongdong Zhao of Wenzhou Medical University, China, Yun-wu Zhang of Xiamen University, China, and colleagues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 1% of the world population is considered to have Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), exhibiting a series of social and cognitive symptoms. Previous research has linked certain genetic factors to ASD, including many associated with neuron activity, but it remains unclear exactly how these factors are related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108336"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/proteins-asd-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/proteins-asd-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/proteins-asd-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/proteins-asd-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/proteins-asd-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/proteins-asd-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/proteins-asd-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/proteins-asd-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows DNA and a child." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/proteins-asd-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/proteins-asd-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/proteins-asd-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/proteins-asd-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/proteins-asd-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/proteins-asd-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/proteins-asd-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This protein system might be a promising target for future therapeutic treatments, but further investigation will be required into the exact functions of this system and its relationship to ASD symptoms. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, Zhao, Zhang and colleagues used mice to examine the activity of two neuronal proteins suspected to be linked to ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MDGA2 is a protein involved in the transmission of nerve signals, and certain mutations in the &lt;em&gt;MDGA2&lt;/em&gt; gene have been identified in ASD patients. Experimental trials revealed that mice with reduced levels of MDGA2 exhibited ASD-like symptoms, including repetitive grooming and altered social behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mice also exhibited increased activity in certain nerve synapses and increased levels of BDNF, another neuronal protein that has been linked to ASD and functions through binding and activating the TrkB protein. When these mice were treated with an artificial peptide that mimicked MDGA2 and inhibited BDNF/TrkB activity, the symptoms lessened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on these results combined with previous research, the authors suggest that MDGA2 and BDNF maintain a natural balance by competing with each other for TrkB protein binding sites, and disruption to this system can lead to regulatory changes in neuron activity related to ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This protein system might be a promising target for future therapeutic treatments, but further investigation will be required into the exact functions of this system and its relationship to ASD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yun-wu Zhang adds, “Mutations in the &lt;em&gt;MDGA2 &lt;/em&gt;gene causes autism spectrum disorders (ASD) but the underlying mechanism is elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study reveals a novel role of MDGA2 in keeping the BDNF/TrkB signaling at bay for normal excitatory neuronal activity, and demonstrates that MDGA2 deficiency results in aberrant BDNF/TrkB activation and elevated excitatory neuronal activity, leading to ASD-like phenotypes in mice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82001442 to D.Z., and 82130039 and U21A20361 to Y.-w.Z.), and Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China (2020M671948 to D.Z., and 2022M722651 to Y.H.).

Both loss of MDGA2 and the ASD-associated MDGA2 V930I mutation promote the BDNF/TrkB signaling activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, we demonstrate that inhibiting the BDNF/TrkB signaling by both small molecular compound and MDGA2-derived peptide can attenuate the increase of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor-mediated excitatory synaptic activity and social deficits in MDGA2-deficient mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results highlight a novel MDGA2-BDNF/TrkB-dependent mechanism underlying the synaptic function regulation, which may become a therapeutic target for ASD.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 21:24:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE9oaUEtQkFoSTlaUEIyT1dLZUdtV2doYlFkSkFHdkZYYjRZN1paVGpSZDBEMFQtMFoySjdkS1BNT0xpdzAtYzY4NG50YlFEZ1VKRWFfVzdBMVh2QXN2S0RzeWNsanlKV2s</guid></item><item><title>Hidden Heart Risks: Antidepressants Linked to Sudden Cardiac Death - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxPVGJiYWJjZGFFOFNVcEdSZGxEa0dGV1J1dkVoanhUWjh2WGtjel9Ea2RCVGJ0TFo0V1FQMHBUanBNTmU3Qk9fT2o3Yl9tOXJHb2c5YzlUaTRqN2dZbnZRN0RxU0ZVSTZMVnFOOVcya01sSFJEN0pSM2Y5VHU1S18za2hrb3BCOVhSQndkV3pNa1BNVUU4T3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 21:11:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPVGJiYWJjZGFFOFNVcEdSZGxEa0dGV1J1dkVoanhUWjh2WGtjel9Ea2RCVGJ0TFo0V1FQMHBUanBNTmU3Qk9fT2o3Yl9tOXJHb2c5YzlUaTRqN2dZbnZRN0RxU0ZVSTZMVnFOOVcya01sSFJEN0pSM2Y5VHU1S18za2hrb3BCOVhSQndkV3pNa1BNVUU4T3c</guid></item><item><title>New study says Lexington has among the highest STI rates in the country - WKYT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQOHZ5c1V6Yi1rLUdYZFI0dkg1dU5UaGprTzAtSTVIdi1VeHd3cWNOQU8zTEtCRUxEcG5PNnBIc1VEVVZJeG9SQlhPTGlHd2tuRUlrVlRXZFB5RndKOEh6S2gzaWtQekZvaEtJMnpDS2VqNU1iQ19FeElQMTh6aE9ncXBzMnVxSkQtVXdCUmNjbjNLS1BBVGRHcw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;LEXINGTON, Ky.

Because it might lead to being able to prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;McDonough explained that Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, and that it's characterized by a buildup of harmful toxins.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If we could clear waste in the brain, pathology would never have a chance to clump and damage neurons and therefore, cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease would not occur (and no Alzheimer's diagnosis would occur either),' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But McDonough explained that all of this research is pretty new. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And as of right now, we don't have good ways to clear brain waste in humans through a procedure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained that this doesn't mean that there's no other possible way to slow the potential diagnosis of Alzheimer's.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Several lifestyle factors may help the brain naturally clear our waste like increasing the quality of one's sleep,' McDonough said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;By clearing up this 'brain waste,' researchers have the potential to prevent the effects of dementia (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'During sleep, the glymphatic system becomes especially active, flushing out the unwanted materials to keep your brain clean and healthy, much like a nightly cleanup that prevents buildup and potential damage.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, he explained that research done on aging mice has shown that regular aerobic exercise can boost the function of the glymphatic system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;McDounough said that this is the brain's cleaning network, and it's boosted by enhancing blood flow and arterial pulsation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research is showing that dementia can also be prevented with more education, correcting hearing loss, reducing cholesterol, reducing depression, increasing physical activity, reducing the likelihood of getting diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other things like eliminating smoking, obesity, lowering alcohol intake, increasing social activity, and reducing exposure to air pollution can also all aid at preventing diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

[but], most likely, there is no virus, let's not hype it up now.” The health agency also reiterated that "spreading unverified information about public health can lead to unnecessary panic" and urged the public to seek medical guidance through official channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " publication="mirror"&gt;Experts from outside the country have been unable to verify reports of the illness, but have warned that the situation in Russia is "very political." Sharon Sanders, a self-trained disease-tracker who helped track the early days of the Covid pandemic, wrote on her site FluTrackers: "Just a reminder... the Russia situation is very political.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " publication="mirror"&gt;"And disease propaganda has been used in the past - globally.

                                        &lt;p&gt;After last weekend’s showers and a week of heat forecast, conditions are ideal for mosquito reproduction, which has officials concerned over the spread of mosquito-borne disease. Last year, mosquito control across the state saw record numbers in travel-related cases of the mosquito-borne disease dengue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, it’s expecting another season of above-average numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It would be surprising if we aren't at the same level that we were last year,” said Steve Harrison, manager of Orange County Mosquito Control. “You could assume that going into the subsequent year that you're going to see a little more activity, because rarely does it drop off to extreme levels from year to year. It's normally a gradual decline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dengue, also known as “bone break fever,” causes a variety of symptoms including fever, muscle and joint pain, nausea, and eye pain. In more severe cases, it can cause abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, and bleeding from the gums or nose, according to the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the state reported 911 travel-related cases, according to data from the Florida Department of Health. There were also 85 local cases reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How dengue goes from one country to another&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travel-related cases are concerning because of how the dengue virus moves from person to person. Florida travelers may go to a dengue-endemic country, like Cuba, and return with the virus. If a Florida mosquito bites that traveler, that mosquito can then infect a Florida resident. If it happens enough times, the virus could become endemic in Florida. Increasing the virus’s odds of propagating are hotter temperatures and more rainfall, creating ideal breeding conditions for more mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harrison said early projections of summer weather indicate mosquitoes should have a season to thrive in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, looking at the trends, one would assume that we're probably going to see levels that we did last year, because people are still traveling as much,” Harrison said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, there have been no reported local cases of dengue throughout the state. However, there have been 49 travel cases as of week 12 of the year. Seven cases have been reported in Central Florida, including four from Orange County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During that same 12-week time period last year, there were 77 cases. This year’s number, although lower, is still concerning considering it’s higher than the 6-year average (2020–2025) of 35 cases, and much higher than the 10-year average (2010-2019) of nine cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organization, dengue cases have been increasing globally for the last 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several factors are associated with the spread of dengue, including “climate change leading to increasing temperatures and high rainfall,” according to WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, FDOH listed 10 different Caribbean destinations where Florida travelers have picked up dengue. The top three were Cuba, Mexico, and Puerto Rico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to stop dengue from spreading&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Florida Mosquito Control teams are calling on residents to help lessen the chance of spreading dengue by tossing out basins of still water on their property, eliminating possible mosquito breeding grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Routinely go out to your yard. Make sure you're flushing out your bird baths. You're flushing out your potted plants, anything that can hold water. Toss out those containers,” Harrison said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone is experiencing a large amount of mosquito activity at their home, they can reach out to mosquito control by calling the county line 311 or 407-836-3111.&lt;/p&gt;

Until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s right. While it’s certainly true that some cheeses are packed with saturated fats and sodium (and not much else), others boast enough vitamins, protein, and good bacteria to receive a gold star from any dietitian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We set out to determine the healthiest cheeses you can eat, consulting two nutritionists and a food scientist in our quest to determine which should earn a spot in this prestigious (to us, at least!) lineup. There were a lot of factors to consider. "Look at the nutrient density per calorie," &lt;a href="https://drexel.edu/cnhp/faculty/profiles/TroutRosemary/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rosemary Trout;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Rosemary Trout&lt;/a&gt;, program director of culinary arts and food science at Drexel University, says. Opt for cheeses that are "low in saturated fat and sodium" and "high in protein, calcium, and probiotics," Jennifer Altman, PsyD, R.D., advises. With all that in mind, here are the five cheeses that took top honors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mozzarella&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;PHOTO: LINDA PUGLIESE; FOOD STYLING: MAKINZE GORE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mozzarella is a shoo-in in this healthy cheese bracket, boasting &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170845/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:six grams of protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;six grams of protein&lt;/a&gt; in just a one-ounce serving. In addition to being high in protein, it’s also "lower in saturated fat and sodium" and "a good source of calcium, phosphorus, and zinc, all essential nutrients for good bone health," Altman shares. Mozzarella also &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29542032/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:contains;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;contains&lt;/a&gt; bacterias Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus fermentum, two valuable probiotics that promote good gut health. Bring on the &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a64208037/fried-ham-cheese-mozzarella-sticks-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mozzarella sticks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;mozzarella sticks&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a25561571/deep-dish-pizza-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:deep-dish pizza;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;deep-dish pizza&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Goat Cheese&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;getty images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its flavor might be divisive for some, but this fresh, creamy cheese brings a host of health benefits, mostly because it’s made with (surprise!) goat’s milk. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7550504/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:High in Vitamin A;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;High in Vitamin A&lt;/a&gt; and Vitamin B2, goat’s milk also contains less lactose than cow’s milk, making it easier to digest for those with lactose sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Trout shares that goat milk cheese is more "metabolically reactive," meaning it’s less likely to be stored as excess fat on the body. This is due to goat milk’s "higher concentration of short-chain fatty acids compared to bovine milk," she explains. Kim Yawitz, R.D. and owner of &lt;a href="https://crossfit26.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Two Six Fitness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Two Six Fitness&lt;/a&gt; in St. Louis, MO, agrees, explaining that these smaller fat molecules are also “digested more quickly...which can help you feel fuller faster" and lead to "eating fewer calories at later meals." A cheese that comes with built-in portion control assistance? Yes, please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cottage Cheese&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;BHOFACK2 - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;High in protein and loaded with valuable Vitamins B and B12, this creamy cheese has been a well-known health food for years. According to Yawitz, "one cup...contains 24 grams of muscle-building, belly-filling protein," making it a great option for people looking to double down on this important macronutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Yawitz shares that many cottage cheese brands "contain bacteria that can help bolster your immune system and improve digestion." Maybe it’s time to give that viral &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a61238259/cottage-cheese-bark-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cottage cheese bark;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cottage cheese bark&lt;/a&gt; a shot!

It’s also high in calcium, with &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170848/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:335 mg per ounce;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;335 mg per ounce&lt;/a&gt; serving. On the flip side, parmesan is fairly high in sodium, so it’s not advised to eat in large amounts—especially if salt is a concern for you—but fortunately, it brings such a punch of flavor that most of us aren’t chomping through a whole block of it in one sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Swiss Cheese&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;gaffera - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This famous holey cheese was &lt;a href="https://torontosun.com/2017/08/18/research-says-swiss-cheese-is-a-superfood" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:shortlisted as a superfood;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;shortlisted as a superfood&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 for containing a healthy probiotic bacterium called Propionibacterium freudenreichii. According to Yawitz, studies have suggested that this probiotic can "help decrease inflammation, fight off infection, and even slow the aging process." Beyond the benefits of this probiotic, Yawitz shares that Swiss cheese is also high in other key nutrients, including "Vitamin B12, calcium, and phosphorus." It’s also "a good source of protein and calcium, which are good for bone health," Altman says. When was the last time you had a &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a23872214/classic-reuben-sandwich-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Reuben;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Reuben&lt;/a&gt;? Might want to get back on that train.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But which cheese is the absolute healthiest? Well...it depends on your specific nutritional needs and health goals. If you’re looking for more protein in your diet, raid your local grocery store for cottage cheese and parmesan. If you’re concerned with the amount of sodium in your diet, grab a ball of mozzarella. And if you want to feel stronger, healthier, and possibly even live longer, reach for that block of Swiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 18:05:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxObDVLU0I2bkxMRE9MRHpmQUxTZHJyUHJnRDNlT2tKWjlpTkl4TEo3bUZ2VVAtam5UV2VTRjVBaURTSEppUXAtdlZjTkhpcEJpU1NEV21iLUJydUVBWEVmdmNiTUp6THpGQU9uN1hNUkdpN1loZlVKZDh3ZDJlOTV5Rw</guid></item><item><title>Texas measles outbreak hits 422 cases with 22 new infections confirmed over last 5 days - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxPbC1FOXBvWmRnZXg2aEg3NnZBaHd6V21oTndMSzJTa0QtemlwTlZNTEZENWRaZlp4SVh2TG9fQ2JWOFFma0JXVkdELXhFOFo0anJ6TlJlTXo0MS1Zb25uRlJOanM2S19NNUlxSlVPdzFGWjgwT0ZXR2RBTk9GcVp4cjY2Wm1RczZkd2xwc1ZNWHhwNVJnQ2FzSdIBngFBVV95cUxQYWFFRGkyQjE5NHV6VnV0cThTdk9ib2UtR0FUdF85NnpybDdWRkRtc3pfLUk1el80UU4xRm4zRVJCYWFteDBsVkp0ZzE1al96SHNhdHIzRnhRc19BbHhtTVhXeUF6R25EZFUwOHRubmtYREM5eVI4azU0T0dsUkhWOHVxelJGSHdyXzJzbWJVejlQaVE0V1pCcTEweU1TUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;The measles outbreak in western Texas is continuing to grow, with 22 new cases confirmed over the last five days, bringing the total to 422 in the state, according to &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; published Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Almost all of the cases are in unvaccinated individuals or in individuals whose vaccination status is unknown, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS).

town at the center of a measles outbreak have been hospitalized after taking an unproven treatment touted by Robert F Kennedy Junior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have reported a handful of unvaccinated children in West Texas were treated for liver damage in the past two months thought to be linked to vitamin A poisoning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;RFK Jr, a &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-14454399/RFK-Jr-urges-vaccination-measles-Texas-outbreak.html"&gt;long-time vaccine skeptic&lt;/a&gt;, has strongly endorsed vitamin A as a treatment for measles despite the evidence being mixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies have shown that supplementation can reduce the risk of compilations and death in malnourished children with severely low levels of vitamin A, which is found in several foods including eggs, dairy, and cod liver oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, other research has shown little benefit in children with adequate vitamin A levels, which is the case for most youngsters in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk of overdosing comes from the fact high levels of vitamin A put significant stress on liver cells, potentially causing inflammation, cell death, and scarring.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;400 cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; have been identified in West Texas communities, where vaccination rates range from 30 to 60 percent, since January. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Forty-one patients have been hospitalized and at least one has died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has endorsed high doses of vitamin A supplements as a safe and effective treatment for measles despite years of scientific research failing to prove this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;RFK Jr recently directed the CDC to&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-statement-on-measles-outbreak.html"&gt; alter its guidance&lt;/a&gt; about treating measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no antiviral for measles but, according to the latest from the agency, ‘Supportive care, including vitamin A administration under the direction of a physician, may be appropriate.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kennedy also touted a study in an op-ed published by Fox News that ‘studies have found that vitamin A can dramatically reduce measles mortality.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He only tepidly supported vaccines which are 97 percent effective at stopping measles infection and almost 100 percent effective at preventing death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Children hospitalized with liver damage were also given the supplement without being monitored by a doctor, according to &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/measles-patients-west-texas-show-004023292.html"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;. This is generally discouraged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Repeated dosing increases the odds of liver damage, people taking it may not know of a pre-existing liver problem, and not every patient will benefit because not every patient becomes severely deficient in the vitamin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases: ‘When measles does occur, vitamin A can be an effective treatment when appropriately administered by a healthcare professional.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The children hospitalized in Texas are believed to have taken super doses above 50,000 IUs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This dose or higher can lead to acute toxicity, causing jaundice, acute abdominal pain, seizures, and coma because too much vitamin A overloads the liver, causing poisoning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hospitalized children all showed abnormal liver function on routine lab tests due to parents giving them high doses of vitamin A.

They were also encouraged to exercise for at least 300 minutes weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of the original 165 participants, 125 successfully completed the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the study’s conclusion, researchers found that participants in the 4:3 intermittent fasting group lost an average of 7.6% of their body weight over the 12 month period, compared to those in the calorie restriction group losing 5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than half (58%) of those in the intermittent fasting group lost at least 5% of their body weight over 12 months, compared to 47% in the calorie restriction group.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they noted that many of these estimates in cardiometabolic changes lacked precision and ultimately yielded inconclusive results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Daily calorie restriction is the most commonly used dietary weight loss strategy,” &lt;a href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/2660" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Victoria A. Catenacci&lt;/a&gt;, MD, associate professor in the Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism, and Diabetes at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and first author of this study told &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, adherence to a strategy where calories are restricted every day is challenging for many people,” Catenacci noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that 4:3 intermittent fasting is an alternative dietary weight loss strategy that may be easier to adhere to over time, and thus may produce modestly superior weight loss compared with daily caloric restriction over one year, when supported by a behavioral weight loss program. Thus, 4:3 intermittent fasting should be considered within the range of evidence-based dietary weight loss approaches to be offered to people desiring weight loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Victoria A. Catenacci, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; had the opportunity to speak with &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Mir Ali&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board-certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The 4:3 intermittent fasting benefits were modest at best,” Ali, who was not involved in the research, pointed out. “Intermittent fasting has been shown in many studies to have beneficial effects. Further studies are necessary to define the optimal fasting schedule and delineate the health benefits. Unfortunately, no one method will work for all people.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Comparing different intermittent fasting regimens, and perhaps breaking down further by other variables such as age, gender, or ethnicity, may help define an optimal diet for a particular group of patients,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also spoke with &lt;a href="https://eatrightrx.com/about-monique-richard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Monique Richard&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN, LDN, a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Nutrition-In-Sight, about this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results of the study were not completely surprising as this type of intermittent fasting may act similarly to ‘metabolic confusion’ or ‘calorie shifting’ which essentially can catch the body by surprise and ‘shake things up’ by oscillating between a calorie deficit and sufficiency in addition to burning calories with exercise between intervals of rest and action,” Richard, who was likewise not involved in the study, explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There have been research studies that have observed the positive benefits of these patterns, as in this study, but it is limited and overall success is highly variable and based on multiple factors unique to the individual and the study design methodology,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the 4:3 intermittent fasting schedule calls for three days of fasting and four days of normal eating each week, that might be hard for some people to commit to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how can a person figure out the best intermittent fasting schedule for them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those interested in trying out intermittent fasting — and more specifically the 4:3 pattern — Richard advised readers to take into consideration several factors that could influence their success and sustainability, such as: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;prescription medications (&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323760" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt;, high blood pressure medication, etc.) that could be impacted by drastically altering nutrient and energy intake&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;mood/emotional and psychological well-being — are you the type of person who gets “hangry” or develops a headache after not eating for 6 to 8 hours?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;social wellbeing — will this pattern impede my ability to join friends and family for dinner parties, celebrations, or brunch? This can lead to isolation, resentment, disordered eating patterns, thoughts or possible &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/173184" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;binge-eating&lt;/a&gt; or related behavior. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Richard said to take it one step at a time with these simple tips: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;have a support group or small group to try intermittent fasting together&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;start slow — observe if fasting for 24 hours is doable, followed by 24 hours of eating 80% of recommended calories for a day, alternate for a week, then build up to 48 hours fasting, and so on&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;keep in mind that nonfasting days are not “a-cheat-day-free-for-all” or “get out of healthy eating pass.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could also practice the 4:3 method by fasting or restricting calorie intake to 20% of your &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/263028" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;daily calorie needs&lt;/a&gt; for 24 hours on three nonconsecutive days per week, as was done in the study. Breaking up fasting days may make this regimen easier to stick to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have long observed that in most instances, a slow, steady, informed, and intentional approach is often most advantageous,” Richard said. “Dietary patterns and activity along with &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/mindfulness-for-mental-wellbeing" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;mindfulness&lt;/a&gt;, neuroplasticity activities, and spiritual and social wellbeing for a well-balanced [life] seem to follow that logic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Meeting with a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) will allow clear information related to nutrient needs and the safety, applicability, and best practices in how implementing a pattern such as this can apply to an individual,” she added. “There are also unique genetic pathways and factors that may inhibit or support the success and desired outcomes using intermittent fasting, which an RDN can help an individual navigate and understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MedicalNewsToday</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 16:41:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNQVAwM3NweF93SmZUU2YzMkp3bzkzX0ZKdTFXMGplTnA3NnhiTUNGZVh5WjRFbGdOUHQyUGxBajVuVVhmaFJKNEhXU3V6WGQ0bEJVNS1TbW5iLTd1Z1JfREpOVGRFaEV0UzVLU0RvbjNrX25jYW9oZWdHQ3VtRmFub2Fpand2UDVPQzZSVEduT1JuNGtnTEhhV3JwVjVQUUNJWHZFbUt2VnZEczBZVXNN</guid></item><item><title>Intermittent fasting can be hit or miss, but research suggests 'sweet spot' can help some stick to their diet - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQSFlGb0ZtVDN6TllIR05QZ0VYR0JSd2d4aFlEMzduSzR4OFRYenJGMDBNdlp0MGNBYWtLNk1PU2phaW9iLVRySDQ3dGgtbzhiYm5VSk9wSFoxYi1GMzZ0Y3V4UzltWXVkYnJaU2MyTWpNN2hMOE9JWjZLQzJmY3JVa2V0bU9qTGwxT041UTQ2dWJWN3NVX0FGbFVhcklSM1Z4dG9vT3A1RVBFZ1HSAbABQVVfeXFMUERKLVRid1lZMk1fVmQ2QTVaal9DWjRKcUZQbjdKY0RJRG9HdTJib3hERjdFcUdyUWVudjB5a2h0S29UeTVISTVqT05QRzcxOXVBcDNpNlF3ZER2TS1yanVTX3d0WUxGd2dqTWZuR0RVNU0tS3Jwd0lfdXVSa2ozdGxOOVdEUUtCOVdud21Ic2lCRW05dHpCdEVnV3dXNFRaUDBnN3VvNE1qUHpaT3FtV04?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;Cutting back on calories three days a week may lead to more weight loss than daily dieting and may be more effective than other types of so-called "intermittent fasting," a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In a &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-01631"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers asked participants to reduce their calorie intake by 80% of what their body needed to maintain weight on three non-consecutive days each week.

If your core is weak, your back and other muscles have to do extra work, which can lead to pain or injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's not just athletes who need a strong core. Everyday activities like bending down to tie your shoes or picking up groceries become way easier when your core is in check.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the coach, people in their 20s should be able to do 40 to 50 crunches  as your core is 'at its prime'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/28/health/how-many-crunches-you-should-be-able-to-do-at-every-age/"&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt;: 'Think of it as a warmup for all the adventures your abs will support, like dancing all night or carrying groceries in one trip.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He then states that those in their in their 30s should manage&lt;span&gt; to do 30 to 40 crunches - noting that 'this is the decade to focus on maintaining strength while juggling work, family and Netflix binges'. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The long-time trainer added that those in their 40s should be able to 20 to 30 crunches as 'your metabolism might slow'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;David also stated that 'consistency is key' and it is important to make sure you are getting some form of exercise in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The New Yorker further recommend that people in their 50s should be able to push through 15 to 25 crunches to 'stay active and strong'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Apart from this, people who are aged 60 and above should be able to do 10 to 20 crunches comfortably. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While David admits that the total number of crunches you are able to do varies from person to person, he also warns that being unable to perform the minimum for your age group could be a red flag for your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained: 'In some cases, difficulty performing crunches could point to underlying issues like back problems, joint pain or even cardiovascular fitness levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It also likely means that your body is craving more and it is your job to give it what it needs and deserves.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finding it difficult to perform exercises while accompanied with chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness or palpitations, may indicate a potential heart health problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the long run, less active people reportedly have a 30 to 50 percent greater risk of developing high blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Strengthening the core muscles through crunches can also help stabilize the spine and reduce the risk of lower back pain and injuries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physical inactivity is also one of the key reasons along with cigarette smoking, high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol that can pave the way for cardiovascular diseases, the New York Department of Health states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the American Heart Association, only about one in five adults and teens get enough exercise to maintain good health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The agency recommends adults to engage in moderate-intensity aerobic activity for about 150 minutes per week, 75 minutes per week of vigorous aerobic activity or a combination of both, preferably spread throughout the week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 16:00:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxOcW5HRTlRbDFSamZtWElXbWtBMFBsX1ZkcXlWUzRUall0MU9rYzJ3cnR2YThIT2daSzhIUk82UTFEblBFNW5KTTA2TG9yeExxWElFRUxHRklvVl9xUjRqZDNYV0dEckh0ZVlaOXY2dFBwOHZSME15VV9Gb3lEU01mU1Eya2NsMTYtcFc5Y3VnTEN2RGZhaXlsa1Z6VUNSOWsz0gGmAUFVX3lxTE5WZkREa0hBTVVLS05KdjI2YTBuRnY3TjVIX1g1MzhNaXp0THVSZW9rbG9UUExIckdRaVpOaS1lemh0MEJCNWttVG1QYU53U3hDR3pra3l3NHlxSkVNTUhHU1AxVVN0UU1Ra0VWMkoyRTdockVFVHFoZDYwd3k3Wjk5NURZNkNzT0tWYmlDbm5UWVp2elZNeWRObTl6WHlQTHVOMUFlbUE</guid></item><item><title>We can, must, and will simulate nematode brains - Hacker News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWEFVX3lxTE5FUTZFbEhvX0ZScVdobDZtaVNySVF2NGZQYzFZOHloMzhQNFN2QWZ6cTFjSzJTRjVXLTJfcl8za1FjTUVGMTdkUVNXbUFYSnU5TXl5cGVQTG0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hacker News</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 15:56:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWEFVX3lxTE5FUTZFbEhvX0ZScVdobDZtaVNySVF2NGZQYzFZOHloMzhQNFN2QWZ6cTFjSzJTRjVXLTJfcl8za1FjTUVGMTdkUVNXbUFYSnU5TXl5cGVQTG0</guid></item><item><title>Low Testosterone?

It's essential for sex drive, muscle growth and strength, and bone density. However, it's important for more than that, according to Madison Reeder, director of clinical operations at &lt;a href="https://modifyhealth.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;ModifyHealth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;"It plays a far more expansive role by supporting cellular signaling, protein synthesis, fat distribution, and cognitive and emotional regulation," Reeder said. The processes supported by testosterone influence everything from muscle maintenance to red blood cell production to energy levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/testosterone-imbalance-signs/" target="_self"&gt;all need testosterone&lt;/a&gt; at some level to feel our best, though it's central to men's health. Low testosterone (also called &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532933/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;hypogonadism&lt;/a&gt;) occurs when the testicles aren't producing enough testosterone. It's more common than you might think. It's estimated that &lt;a href="https://www.endocrine.org/patient-engagement/endocrine-library/hypogonadism" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;35% of men over 45&lt;/a&gt; years of age have hypogonadism.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While lifestyle changes like moderating alcohol and quitting smoking are necessary for maintaining testosterone levels, another important factor is what you eat. Packing your diet with certain foods may help boost your testosterone levels to a healthy range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why do testosterone levels vary?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testosterone naturally fluctuates. According to Dr. Justin Houman, an assistant professor of urology at &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/home.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Cedars-Sinai Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;, testosterone levels are generally at their highest point in the morning and decline throughout the day, in line with the body's circadian rhythm. Testosterone also changes throughout life. It sharply increases during puberty and gradually decreases after age 30. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Beyond that, fluctuations can be influenced by a wide range of factors: &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/get-better-sleep-for-sleep-awareness-month-with-these-6-simple-tips/" target="_self"&gt;sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/carefree-era-tactics-relieve-stress/" target="_self"&gt;stress levels&lt;/a&gt; (particularly &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/blood-stress-test-cortisol-effects-our-bodies/" target="_self"&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt;), body fat percentage, alcohol consumption, certain medications and even acute or chronic illness," said Houman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pituitary gland is central to regulating testosterone production in the body, and it's a sensitive system that can easily be thrown off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things that can &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15603-low-testosterone-male-hypogonadism" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;impact testosterone levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; include but are not limited to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the American Urological Association, low testosterone is a &lt;a href="https://www.auanet.org/guidelines-and-quality/guidelines/testosterone-deficiency-guideline" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;level below 300 ng/dL&lt;/a&gt;. A healthy range is considered between 450 and 600ng/dL. "However, there is no "one-size-fits-all" testosterone level. The body's ideal level is influenced by age, sex, genetics, health history, and even how well you sleep or manage stress," Reeder said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're struggling with low testosterone, one of the first places you can look is your diet. Unhealthy diets or chronic under-fueling can impair hormone production while working toward a balanced diet full of nutrients can help stabilize your levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9 foods that may increase testosterone&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There isn't a single 'testosterone superfood,' but certain foods support the body's natural testosterone production by providing key nutrients or reducing inflammation and oxidative stress," Houman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nutritional content of certain foods can give you a leg up when it comes to testosterone, especially if you're deficient in that particular nutrient. Reeder pointed to zinc, vitamin D, magnesium, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/keep-your-heart-healthy-with-omega-3s-heres-how-to-add-them-to-your-diet/" target="_self"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; and high-quality protein as pivotal nutrients for healthy testosterone production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding the foods on this list to your diet won't magically fix low testosterone levels. However, being intentional about making good food choices can help supplement level management as you speak to your doctor.

They are great sources of "good fats" known as omega-3s, which are known to support heart and joint health. Research has revealed that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33741447/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;low-fat diets can be associated&lt;/a&gt; with lower testosterone levels. While we need more research to fully understand why this is, adding healthy fats to your diet, like fatty fish, can benefit your overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not the only benefit of fatty fish. They have a high nutritional content of essential vitamins like zinc and vitamin D, which are crucial for healthy testosterone levels. Those with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10518189/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;less vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; tend to have lower testosterone levels than those with more vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can take a fish oil supplement if you're not a fish eater. A 2020 study found that &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0952327820301629" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;fish oil supplements with omega-3s&lt;/a&gt; boost testosterone in men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cruciferous vegetables &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Houman explained that cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower and Brussels sprouts can indirectly support healthier testosterone balance by lowering estrogen levels. They can do this because cruciferous vegetables have a compound called &lt;a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/indole-3-carbinol" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;indole-3-carbinol&lt;/a&gt;.

Oysters offer the most zinc per serving than any food. Other shellfish, like shrimp, clams, mussels, crab and lobster, have notable zinc levels.

A study of active young men found that drinking two cups of pure pomegranate juice each day for three weeks helped with muscle recovery, reduced inflammation and saw an &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1016/j.ajme.2017.03.005" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increase in testosterone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Olive oil&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olive oil has several health benefits, like increasing &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/naturally-boost-your-heart-health-with-these-5-foods/" target="_self"&gt;good cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and lowering &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/cholesterol-everything-you-should-know/" target="_self"&gt;bad cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;. There is also some evidence that it may increase testosterone. One small study published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research of 60 young males discovered that a daily intake of around five teaspoons of &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2021/02000/whole_egg_vs__egg_white_ingestion_during_12_weeks.17.aspx" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;extra virgin olive oil increased testosterone by 17%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fermented foods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reeder explained that gut health is gaining more attention for its role in hormone regulation.

However, if you're looking for a specific diet to help you create meals, try the Mediterranean diet. It's rich in lean proteins, healthy fats and plenty of veggies. Houman explained that following a Mediterranean diet has been linked to higher testosterone levels and better reproductive health in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don't have to follow the &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/ultimate-guide-mediterranean-diet-2025-healthiest-diet/" target="_self"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; to boost your testosterone levels; you can focus on healthy eating habits to see the benefits. However, it's essential to acknowledge what not to do. Houman explained that ultra-processed foods and high-sugar diets can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11412839/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;suppress testosterone&lt;/a&gt; by promoting insulin resistance.

Fats, especially those from whole food sources, provide cholesterol, a crucial building block for hormone production," Reeder said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't cut out all fats from your diet or you may see a hormone level drop. Instead, focus on high-quality fats and moderate how often you eat processed foods. If you don't know where to start with your diet or how to recognize your food patterns, working with a registered dietitian can help you find a diet that works best for your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other natural ways to boost testosterone&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything starts with the foods you eat, though your diet isn't the only thing that could impact your testosterone levels.

Beyond confirming the presence of the disease, the test also helps determine the stage of its progression. This may fundamentally change how physicians manage Alzheimer’s care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test was developed by experts at &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis&lt;/a&gt; and Lund University in Sweden. Their studies indicate that a particular blood protein, MTBR-tau243, can be used to monitor the extent of dangerous tau accumulation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tangles of tau protein are some of the hallmark characteristics of Alzheimer’s and are directly proportional to the intensity of the symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new technique is considerably more convenient than brain scans since it is non-invasive, and does not require expensive procedures that are difficult to access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tracking-alzheimer-s-with-a-blood-test"&gt;Tracking Alzheimer’s with a blood test&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, doctors can use several blood &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/blood-tests-offer-new-hope-in-detecting-alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tests&lt;/a&gt; to help detect Alzheimer’s. Some of the tests that are already in use are based on earlier discoveries at Washington University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tests look for early warning signs but don’t reveal how much the disease has progressed. That’s a crucial gap. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/medical-breakthrough-new-vaccine-may-prevent-alzheimers-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s treatments&lt;/a&gt; are most helpful in the early stages, before too much damage has been done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a way to tell whether someone is in an early or late phase of the disease would help doctors decide which treatment would work best. It could also clarify whether a person’s memory or thinking issues are actually caused by Alzheimer’s or something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This blood test clearly identifies Alzheimer’s tau tangles, which is our best biomarker measure of Alzheimer’s symptoms and dementia,” said co-senior author Dr. Randall J. Bateman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In clinical practice right now, we don’t have easy or accessible measures of Alzheimer’s tangles and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/risk-of-dementia-is-much-higher-than-previously-thought/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, and so a tangle blood test like this can provide a much better indication if the symptoms are due to Alzheimer’s and may also help doctors decide which treatments are best for their patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-reliable-way-to-monitor-the-disease"&gt;A reliable way to monitor the disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s typically starts with a buildup of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleeping-may-lower-levels-of-alzheimers-abnormal-proteins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;amyloid protein&lt;/a&gt; in the brain. Tau tangles develop later and mark the point when symptoms begin to show. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to see these changes has been through PET scans, which can track amyloid and tau deposits. But these scans are expensive, time-consuming, and often only available in large hospitals or research centers. That’s why scientists have been working on blood-based alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team had already developed blood tests that measure amyloid plaque buildup. Earlier research showed that levels of MTBR-tau243 in spinal fluid could match up with brain tau levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this new study, the researchers demonstrated that they could get the same results using blood samples. A blood draw is much easier and more accessible than a spinal tap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-testing-the-new-approach"&gt;Testing the new approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To validate the test, the researchers used data from two groups of people. One group came from a research center at Washington University and included 108 volunteers. The other group included 55 people from a Swedish study known as BioFINDER-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the experts checked their findings with data from 739 additional people in the BioFINDER-2 group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These participants represented a range of Alzheimer’s stages – from people who had no symptoms but had amyloid in their brains, to those with mild cognitive issues, to people with full dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also included individuals with memory or thinking problems due to other conditions, and some who were cognitively healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alzheimer-s-progression-revealed-in-blood"&gt;Alzheimer’s progression revealed in blood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were promising. MTBR-tau243 levels in the blood matched the amount of tau tangles in the brain with 92% accuracy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In healthy people and those in the earliest stage of the disease, the levels were normal. But in people showing symptoms, the protein levels were clearly elevated – and much higher in those with advanced disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This difference made it easy to tell who was in an early or late stage of Alzheimer’s. It also helped distinguish Alzheimer’s dementia from other kinds of cognitive problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of clarity could make a huge difference in choosing the right treatment path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new test uses technology licensed by Washington University to C2N Diagnostics, which previously developed similar blood tests for amyloid plaques. The earlier tests were designed to detect another tau protein called p-tau217.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe we will use blood-based p-tau217 to determine whether an individual has Alzheimer’s disease, but MTBR-tau243 will be a highly valuable complement in both clinical settings and research trials,” said Oskar Hansson, a professor of neurology at Lund University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When both of these &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/alzheimers-disease-earliest-biomarker-protein-psd-95-identified/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;biomarkers&lt;/a&gt; are positive, the likelihood that Alzheimer’s is the underlying cause of a person’s cognitive symptoms increases significantly, compared to when only p-tau217 is abnormal. This distinction is crucial for selecting the most appropriate treatment for each patient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-looking-ahead-to-better-treatments"&gt;Looking ahead to better treatments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are two FDA-approved drugs that target amyloid in the brain to slow Alzheimer’s. But more treatments are being tested – including ones that aim at tau protein and other disease mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As these therapies become available, doctors will need reliable ways to match the right treatment to each stage of the disease. Blood tests could be the key to this shift toward personalized Alzheimer’s care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re about to enter the era of personalized medicine for Alzheimer’s disease,” said Kanta Horie, a research associate professor of neurology at WashU Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For early stages with low tau tangles, anti-amyloid therapies could be more efficacious than in late stages. But after the onset of dementia with high tau tangles, anti-tau therapy or one of the many other experimental approaches may be more effective.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once we have a clinically available blood test for staging, plus treatments that work at different stages of the disease, doctors will be able to optimize their treatment plans for the specific needs of each patient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03617-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;

A fan favourite Starbucks drink made the cut!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to know more!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alcohol&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Levine, drinking booze is “likely safe if you have one or less drinks a day if you have no heart problems, but alcohol intake increases blood pressure, triglycerides, atrial fibrillation and — in higher doses — is a direct toxin to the heart, so much so we have a phrase in cardiology — alcohol cardiomyopathy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol consumption, even in small amounts, can negatively impact heart health and increase the risk of cardiovascular problems, including heart disease, stroke, and heart failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a more detailed explanation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How Alcohol Affects the Heart:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Increased Risk of Cardiovascular Diseases:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Studies show that even moderate alcohol consumption can elevate the risk of cardiovascular diseases like coronary disease, stroke, heart failure, hypertensive heart disease, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and aneurysm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;High Blood Pressure:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excessive alcohol intake can lead to high blood pressure, a major risk factor for heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Cardiomyopathy:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heavy drinking can contribute to cardiomyopathy, a condition that affects the heart muscle and can lead to heart failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Irregular Heart Rhythms (Arrhythmias):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Binge drinking or excessive alcohol consumption can disrupt the heart's rhythm, leading to arrhythmias, which can increase the risk of stroke and heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Damage to Heart Muscle:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Long-term heavy drinking can damage the heart muscle, making it weaker and less efficient at pumping blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Increased Heart Rate:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alcohol can temporarily increase heart rate, and if it goes over 100 beats per minute, it can cause a condition called tachycardia, which can lead to more serious issues like heart failure or irregular rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Levine, alcohol cardiomyopathy is a heart condition caused specifically by chronic heavy alcohol consumption, and it can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Levine concurs with the recent debunking of the common wisdom that a couple of glasses of red wine a day is good for your heart, as he told NY Post, “Simply put: people who drank a glass of wine may have been more athletic or had some other unaccounted benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Soda&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per Levine, “Let's be simple here: a can of soda has 10 teaspoons of sugar in it or the equivalent amount of corn syrup. It’s toxic!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excessive consumption of soda, especially sugary sodas, can be detrimental to heart health, potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and other related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Here's a more detailed explanation:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sugar Content and Cardiovascular Risk:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sugary drinks, including soda, are high in added sugars and empty calories, which can contribute to weight gain, obesity, and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. These conditions, in turn, are major risk factors for heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Studies Linking Soda to Heart Problems:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Research suggests that consuming sugary drinks, including soda, is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, even in physically active individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Other Health Concerns:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beyond heart health, excessive soda consumption can lead to other health problems, including tooth decay, metabolic disorders, and weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Levine, these huge doses of sugar, which mostly come in the form of corn syrup in the US, raise triglycerides, increase your weight, spike your blood sugar levels, and give your diabetes risk an uptick — all of which damage the heart. He said, “I want everyone to imagine drinking 1/5 of a cup of pure corn syrup because that’s what you’re doing every time you drink a can of Coke.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Energy drinks&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This brand of drink might boost your energy for the time being, but does more harm than good in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy drinks can pose risks to heart health due to their high caffeine content and other stimulants, potentially leading to increased heart rate, blood pressure, and irregular heart rhythms, especially for individuals with pre-existing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Here's a more detailed explanation:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine and Stimulants: Energy drinks contain high levels of caffeine and other stimulants like guarana and taurine, which can significantly increase heart rate and blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Heart Rhythm Issues:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The combination of these ingredients can potentially disrupt the heart's normal rhythm, leading to arrhythmias or palpitations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Increased Risk for Certain Individuals:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; People with pre-existing heart conditions, hypertension, or those with genetic heart conditions may be at a higher risk of experiencing adverse effects from energy drinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Other Health Concerns:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides heart-related issues, energy drinks are also high in sugar and calories, which can contribute to weight gain, obesity, and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per Levine, “Drinks like Red Bull have about 1.5 times the caffeine as coffee but also contain almost eight teaspoons or more of sugar — or worse, corn syrup. The Monster energy drink has almost 15 teaspoons of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="93"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Starbucks frappuccino&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last but not the least - the devil for the heart lies in the Starbucks’ frappuccino!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if it breaks your heart - let it; because quitting the beloved frappuccino is going to be the best thing you’d do for your heart for the longer run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levine told NY Post, “A grande iced frap used to be my favorite. Until I realized I actually got a high off this stuff and then crashed within two hours.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it’s got almost 100 mg of caffeine and 51 grams of sugar — the equivalent of 13 teaspoons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per Levine, “People may not realize but that’s almost as much sugar as the Monster energy drink — 57 grams — but less than the 160 mg of caffeine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levine believes “it’s potentially dangerous stress on the heart for anyone with heart disease to drink these concoctions of caffeine and sugar and a perfect storm to induce palpitations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He notes that’s especially true for anyone trying to get a little pick-me-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cardiologist warns, “Adding alcohol for a boost or a hangover cure only makes it worse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Evictions hit families during housing shortage in Phoenix&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Brain Mapping Tool Reveals How Learning Rewires Synaptic Links - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE5TZHJRRXVRY05yTkFuakRWems3Y2dGX2NhdENRUzI4OGpaMTloSjVFUmRtX1BHZzJUb28zYkdkdUlxWWpfLVdZUzZhLW9udW4tWGZGM2gtOERaY0c1YWpPT0Y1NHg3czl6MG5mYk1qN0Fhd3dv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers have developed DELTA, a powerful new imaging method that maps brain-wide synaptic changes during learning.

Experiences cause the strength of these connections to change – a process called synaptic plasticity, which underlies learning and memory.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janelia researchers have devised a new way to see where these synaptic changes are happening across the entire brain. The work was led by the Spruston and Lavis labs and the lab of former Janelia Senior Group Leader Karel Svoboda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new imaging method, DELTA, provides scientists with a brain-wide map of how individual synaptic proteins change over time. Proteins important for synaptic plasticity are known to be degraded or synthesized as synaptic connections change. So, tracking these synaptic protein changes during learning enables scientists to also understand how synaptic connections change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This information allows researchers to home in on areas of the brain that might be important for learning and memory and helps them figure out the molecular mechanisms behind the synaptic changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the problems in figuring out which molecules are in charge of what changes is that it’s very hard to know where those changes are happening. We didn’t have good way of figuring out where in the brain things are changing so we can focus our attention on the most interesting parts,” says Boaz Mohar, a Research Scientist in the Spruston Lab who led the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now we have a different way of looking at our manipulations and how they affect the circuit at the brain-wide level by using imaging to drill down on the subcellular structure. This helps us bridge that gap between behavior and mechanism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method works by first labeling a synaptic protein of interest in the mouse brain with a bright Janelia Fluor (JF) dye. To investigate how synaptic connections change during learning, the researchers used mice that had already been trained to on a simple task: learning to associate two distinct visual cues with a water reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this initial labeling, the mice were split into two groups: one group received water randomly at the two cues, as they had prior to labeling, while the task for the other group was modified such that only one of the cues was associated with the water reward. After a few days, once the researchers saw a clear difference between the two groups’ actions, the same synaptic protein of interest was labeled with a different JF dye in both groups of mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over those days, some of the original labeled proteins are degraded and some new proteins are synthesized, incorporating the second dye. By imaging the entire brain, researchers can see where the synaptic proteins have changed in both groups of mice, giving them a hint as to where changes in synaptic connections are happening during learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers saw that learning the modified task caused the synaptic protein they studied, GluA2, to change in specific brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also used the new method to see differences in protein turnover in mice living in a normal environment and mice living in an enriched environment with toys and companions. In this case, putting a mouse in an enriched environment caused widespread changes in GluA2 across the entire brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By enabling researchers to see these brain-wide changes, DELTA gives scientists a starting point for follow up studies to detail the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a next step, the researchers are working to add additional features to DELTA that will allow them to pinpoint when proteins are changing during the few days the animals are learning a task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the lab heads who led the project, Nelson Spruston, says the development of DELTA exemplifies the collaborative spirit of the research campus, with scientists across Janelia lending their knowledge in chemistry, imaging, behavior, and genetics to the project. The team also collaborated with experts outside Janelia, including researchers at Northwestern University who helped to validate the method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the team is working with scientists around the world to help them use DELTA to track synaptic changes in their own research, collaborations enabled through Janelia’s Visiting Scientist Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a quintessential Janelia project,” Spruston says. “It involved doing something that nobody has ever done before and required collaboration with lots of people who contributed expertise to make this all possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this brain mapping and synaptic plasticity research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#70121f1d0015091e3018181d195e1f0217" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nanci Bompey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://hhmi.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;HHMI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Nanci Bompey – HHMI&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-01923-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DELTA: a method for brain-wide measurement of synaptic protein turnover reveals localized plasticity during learning&lt;/a&gt;” by Boaz Mohar et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DELTA: a method for brain-wide measurement of synaptic protein turnover reveals localized plasticity during learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synaptic plasticity alters neuronal connections in response to experience, which is thought to underlie learning and memory. However, the loci of learning-related synaptic plasticity, and the degree to which plasticity is localized or distributed, remain largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we describe a new method, DELTA, for mapping brain-wide changes in synaptic protein turnover with single-synapse resolution, based on Janelia Fluor dyes and HaloTag knock-in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During associative learning, the turnover of the ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit GluA2, an indicator of synaptic plasticity, was enhanced in several brain regions, most markedly hippocampal area CA1. More broadly distributed increases in the turnover of synaptic proteins were observed in response to environmental enrichment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In CA1, GluA2 stability was regulated in an input-specific manner, with more turnover in layers containing input from CA3 compared to entorhinal cortex. DELTA will facilitate exploration of the molecular and circuit basis of learning and memory and other forms of plasticity at scales ranging from single synapses to the entire brain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 13:28:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5TZHJRRXVRY05yTkFuakRWems3Y2dGX2NhdENRUzI4OGpaMTloSjVFUmRtX1BHZzJUb28zYkdkdUlxWWpfLVdZUzZhLW9udW4tWGZGM2gtOERaY0c1YWpPT0Y1NHg3czl6MG5mYk1qN0Fhd3dv</guid></item><item><title>Stress has a sweet spot. 5 tips to help you find it - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQNjlzVGQ0Tlc0QjJpejRvU2xzZy01b05yeWYtYWFSWHFfd1VORGk4SWt3T1VlTDM3dEZRN0ZLR0xad08xNDZOY1FkMG01eTJaSjU3OFNLeGhvcG16OWZoS0ZmNWdraE5ValYzQ3EzNTJvaEN4TFRITDE0UktTeGV6aTZPSTB4MmPSAX5BVV95cUxONXJzcUJrQm9fS2pBaUJCVnRiYy0yalgwMFlQS2xqNlhrUlFqUDFDYjV2bUxBaTVXZVFBLTV2UUp0SXFnbTdyNC1pbTV6bHFheUxVUThWWHZyeXY2U3JGY214WjJ2M21tM1pEbzlCYWVuWGlnVkRmWjlVczMtSWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;(CNN) — &lt;/strong&gt;“Stress is bad for your health” is one message we consistently hear.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfe663000l3b6m64w2j5fd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And it’s true: &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/04/health/stress-health-connection-wellness/index.html"&gt;stress can be detrimental&lt;/a&gt;, and lead to a whole host of ills, especially when it becomes chronic, unrelenting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfdxar000j3b6m7c2315qs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But, it turns out, certain types of stress can &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/21/health/keep-cool-under-pressure-wellness/index.html"&gt;lead to growth opportunities&lt;/a&gt; and, according to one doctor and author of the new book, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stress-Paradox-Essential-Management-Mind-Body-Soul-ebook/dp/B0CW13NLBZ" target="_blank"&gt;“The Stress Paradox: Why You Need Stress to Live Longer, Healthier, and Happier,”&lt;/a&gt; the right amount of it may actually be crucial to our wellbeing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfwfqz000q3b6mzml396ar@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Yes, too much stress harms us, but not enough is actually just as harmful,” Dr. Sharon Bergquist told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently, on his podcast Chasing Life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfwfqz000r3b6m0vkq5mbz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bergquist, an assistant professor at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and the founder and director of &lt;a href="https://www.emoryhealthcare.org/centers-programs/lifestyle-medicine-wellness" target="_blank"&gt;Emory Lifestyle Medicine &amp;amp; Wellness&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;knows a thing or two about stress. As a child, she lived through the Iranian Revolution and ultimately her family was forced to flee.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfwfqz000s3b6mfpjvocf3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We were the last plane to leave before (Iranian leader Ruhollah) Khomeini came,” she recalled. “The airport was incredibly packed. I remember the whole process of trying to get through security and just the mass of people that were there and how we got onto the runway — every step of it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfwfqz000t3b6m2hjq6t5g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Her family fled to England, and eventually they settled in the United States. But life wasn’t exactly stress-free in the West either. “In eighth grade I could not write a paragraph in English without a lot of struggle. It would take me all night,” she said. Yet she managed to prosper, graduate as her high school’s valedictorian, attend Yale University as an undergraduate and then Harvard Medical School.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfwfqz000u3b6mgugrmm7q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bergquist’s childhood experiences planted the seeds for her interest in stress. “Ultimately it triggered this obsession for me of, why is it that some people grow and thrive from these experiences? And others don’t?” she said. She said she became really interested in the question of whether all stress is harmful.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/html-embed/instances/cm8xfwjsg000w3b6m7reygeve@published" class="html-embed" data-editable="settings" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
    
&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfw6ro000o3b6mzh8bpm5w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to Bergquist’s research, it turns out that it depends on the type and amount of stress a person’s exposed to.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00113b6mnaioufys@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I work with a lot of professionals (who) are very driven, but are also so passionate about what they do,” she said, noting that they lead what can be considered “stressful” lives. She counts herself among them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00123b6m5mfhqda5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I call that good stress, which I think has a very different effect on our bodies than the harmful stress that has become almost synonymous with what people describe as ‘stress’” she said. “I think I can now say with a comfortable level, that (the good) type of stress releases a biochemical profile that is actually health promoting: we release, for example, dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00133b6myjrvtmlt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The dopamine is from the reward for doing something meaningful, she explained. The serotonin is from the joy that comes from accomplishment and the oxytocin is from contributing to the greater good.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00143b6mw7w9aazv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said “bad” stress is unpredictable, unavoidable, and not brief or intermittent but rather chronic. Our biochemical response to that type of stress is to release cortisol which eventually leads to the harmful downstream effects on our bodies, such as high blood pressure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00153b6ma9m5jns1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That trifecta of chemicals released when we take on good stress “mitigates our cortisol level. It literally builds our resilience to stress,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Resilience is like a muscle: It is dynamic and needs to be challenged to get stronger.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The key, really, is that our stress responses are there to help us. They’re there to help us adapt to our world,” she said, noting that for the entirety of human history that is how humans have survived and thrived.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00183b6m696j75er@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But the things that help us activate those stress responses have been removed from the fabric of our lives,” she said. No longer do we have to face environmental stressors such as food scarcity and exposure to extremes of heat and cold.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00193b6mx4ihwmte@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The introduction of a lot of these comforts has removed our connection with the natural environment that we live in,” she said. Consequently “we are essentially handicapping ourselves because we are not allowing our bodies to do what they are so capable of doing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001a3b6m1thhggzp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What can you do to introduce good stress into your life? Bergquist has five tips.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001b3b6m5zw85epl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Challenge yourself to go outside your comfort zone without feeling overwhelmed,” said Bergquist via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001c3b6ma6d3g7r8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Good stress is medicine. And like any medicine, the dose determines the response,” she explained. “Growth from stress happens when stress is in a hormetic, or Goldilocks, zone — a just right amount that’s not too much or too little.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001d3b6mwyalwifz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In other words, push yourself to get in the water and swim, but don’t let yourself drown.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001e3b6m5kx3q32t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Are you challenging yourself in ways that align with your beliefs? Or conflict with them?” Bergquist asked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001f3b6mqb86l8au@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Your heart and mind know the difference,” she said. “Persevering in situations where you feel stuck or disconnected from your values can become a harmful form of stress.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001g3b6m0vt1v1yq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Good stress is not about simply positively reframing the stress in our lives,” she said. “But instead, deliberately taking action with meaningful and purpose-driven challenges as an antidote to the chronic stressors that we can’t control or avoid.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001h3b6mag0uo3yd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For example, she said, it could involve accepting or creating a job opportunity that aligns with your values or learning a skill that you find rewarding.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001i3b6mzh42j0q8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “To grow from stress, you have to make time for rest and recovery,” Bergquist said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001j3b6moz69d5hg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Under stress, your body switches into a mode where you conserve energy and do internal housekeeping,” she said. “When you recover, your brain and body remodel and build new connections that better prepare you for future challenges.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001k3b6mdni8hwib@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recovery, Bergquist said, is just as important as good stress to gain benefits. “Even good stress can build up to becoming harmful without recovery.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  &lt;h3 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm8xfy05e001v3b6mpo96ro26@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="lean-into-the-connection-between-your-mind-and-body" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Lean into the connection between your mind and body
&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001l3b6m7ee129a9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Physically stressing yourself can help build mental resilience and vice versa,” Bergquist said. “It’s a remarkable process called cross-adaptation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001m3b6m33y2nz1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you experience good physical or psychological stress, you repair and regenerate your cells, which makes every part of your body healthier and stronger,” she explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001n3b6mtyrfsv39@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You can build mental resilience, for example, by physically stressing yourself (in a good way) by doing things like “eating plant-based foods with stress resistance-building phytochemicals, exercising vigorously, briefly exposing yourself to heat and cold, and fasting intermittently through time-restricted eating,” she said. “We have many tools for managing stress and lessening its harm.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001o3b6mu90v2wof@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experiencing stress is not a glitch— it’s a feature. “Our human history is one of overcoming stress — and becoming stronger because of it,” Bergquist said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001p3b6mobup51i0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Through repeat cycles of stress and recovery, we summon our natural capability. It’s a gift we have inherited in our DNA,” she said. “Resilience is a muscle we can all build no matter where we are or what we are facing. It’s okay to have fears. And it’s okay to want to avoid challenges.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001q3b6mmiai5zz3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Trust and do it anyway. The result can be life-changing,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

People with a history of abuse or neglect were more likely to feel distress during everyday setbacks and less likely to experience joy from good moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, even positive events triggered negative emotions, highlighting a long-lasting emotional imprint. These findings suggest that childhood adversity subtly shapes emotional life in adulthood, even for those without clinical mental health diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blunted Joy Response:&lt;/strong&gt; Adults with childhood adversity feel less happiness from positive events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional Oversensitivity:&lt;/strong&gt; They react more intensely to daily stress and problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lasting Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Childhood trauma affects emotional experiences well into later adulthood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Heriot Watt University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad experiences in childhood can have long-lasting effects, making people more sensitive to their daily ups and downs as adults.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from Heriot-Watt University shows that adverse childhood experiences not only cause people to respond more negatively to bad events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also affects how they respond to good events in daily life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108326"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows the outline of a child and adult." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/childhood-adversity-emotion-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;People who faced physical and emotional abuse as children had stronger emotional reactions to daily problems. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research is published in &lt;em&gt;Emotion&lt;/em&gt;, a journal published by the American Psychological Association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negative reactions to lows and highs &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sophie Potter from Heriot-Watt University’s School of Social Sciences, with colleagues from the University of Leicester and the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, investigated how childhood adversity affects people’s reactions to everyday experiences, good and bad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They studied nearly 2000 adults aged 35 to 86. For eight days, participants wrote about their experiences and emotions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Potter said: “Most research has focused on how people with difficult childhoods react more strongly to bad events, like stress or problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But there’s not much on how childhood adversity affects people’s ability to feel joy or happiness at positive events, like having a laugh with friends or receiving positive feedback at work.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who faced physical and emotional abuse as children had stronger emotional reactions to daily problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not only do they have a more negative reaction to bad events, but they are also less likely to feel happy about good things. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In fact, good events appear to trigger negative reactions.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A ‘subtle effect’ on daily life &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potter points out that around 30% of adults in Western countries have experienced adversity in their childhoods, but our knowledge of its impact focuses on a small group of people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of research has been conducted with people who have gone on to experience clinical levels of depression or anxiety, for example, instead of the general population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There will be thousands of people in the UK and across other western nations who aren’t suffering from a major clinical disorder, but childhood adversity may still be having a subtle effect on their daily life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding that childhood adversity could be affecting how you experience good and bad events could help people self-regulate and adapt.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research used the MIDUS dataset, and Potter says she would like to expand the research with a bigger group of people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It would be interesting to use data from more diverse groups, whether it’s race and ethnicity or age.

Data were drawn from the National Study of Daily Experiences 2 (NSDE-II), collected 2004–2009, whereupon middle-aged and older adults (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 1,994; &lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 58.61; range = 35–86; 57% female) reported daily events and affect on eight consecutive evenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multilevel models were used to estimate the moderating role of ACEs for within-person associations between positive/negative events and affect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that cumulative ACEs and a number of individual adversities (specifically those characterized by abuse but not by neglect or household challenge/dysfunction) were associated with emotional reactivity to positive &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; negative daily events. That is, cumulative and abuse-based ACEs were associated with increased negative affect and/or decreased positive affect on days with a negative event &lt;em&gt;and on days with a positive event&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings add to literature on the long-lasting and pervasive influence of early life experiences on everyday emotional experiences in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discuss differences in reactivity to positive versus negative daily events and in cumulative versus adversity-specific associations as well as their theoretical and methodological implications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 12:59:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE9LRi1PT3pjaW9ZV2xVNGF0NVhxM09NUTdGV3ctLTNZeGxheFRWMHZfNnF1Y0tKbi1XUFI0U19rcnZ6MFdrOU9ya0NNM1BHa0lDcUpvWlp6ODNUczMwMFZCU0RKR25TQVdYcTUwa3lfTWNaWW1ITkE</guid></item><item><title>Brain Circuit for Vicarious Fear Reveals How We Feel Others’ Pain - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZEFVX3lxTE1qTmMyMTJCbU1BMy0tTlJ1TWlHb2lDbmhva1ZsTU4yNkF3a0dKd0o5OXM1OHp5UE1fUlRqTnl3bnF3TjMwYkppSFUzTDVZMXZjT2FPdWJiQkFHMUZHQi12aGVQNC0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Scientists have uncovered a dedicated brain circuit that distinguishes between direct fear and fear learned by observing others—known as vicarious fear. The study shows that the right side of the brainstem’s locus coeruleus (LC) activates a specific pathway to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during vicarious fear, while the left side processes direct fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disabling the right LC-ACC pathway in mice erased their vicarious fear response, revealing the brain’s lateralized design for emotional processing. These findings offer new insights into empathy, social learning, and potential treatments for disorders like psychopathy, social anxiety, and autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lateralized Processing:&lt;/strong&gt; The right brainstem (LC) regulates vicarious fear, while the left handles direct fear.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vicarious Fear Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; A specialized LC→ACC circuit activates only during observed distress in others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may inform treatments for empathy-related psychiatric disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Institute for Basic Science&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you ever felt a chill run down your spine while watching someone else in distress?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon, known as vicarious fear, allows us to experience fear by observing others—even when we are not in direct danger ourselves. This aligns with the concept of ‘putting oneself in another’s shoes’—both figuratively and, as research suggests, even neurologically. Just as we metaphorically step into another’s place to understand their emotions, our brain processes fear vicariously when we witness someone else’s distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108322"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows the outline of a person." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;While lateralization is well-known in language and motor control, this research shows that it also plays a role in emotional processing. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While essential for social learning and survival, the neural mechanisms distinguishing direct fear (from personal threats) and vicarious fear (from others’ distress) have remained a mystery—until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research team led by Dr. SHIN Hee-sup at the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) has uncovered a fundamental brain circuit that distinguishes these two types of fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings reveal that the locus coeruleus (LC), a small brainstem structure that produces norepinephrine (NA), plays a crucial role in processing fear—but in a lateralized manner, with the right and left hemispheres serving distinct functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists have studied how the brain processes fear, focusing primarily on regions like the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The locus coeruleus (LC) has also been recognized as a key player in stress and fear responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, until now, it was unknown whether the LC treats direct and vicarious fear as one and the same—or whether the brain has evolved distinct pathways for these different experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using advanced neuroscience techniques such as optogenetics (light-based neural control), fiber photometry (real-time neural activity measurement), and viral tracing (mapping brain connections), the researchers pinpointed a specialized neural circuit that selectively processes vicarious fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They hypothesized that the right-hemisphere LC connects to the ACC to regulate fear learned from others, while a separate pathway governs direct fear responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this idea, the team selectively inhibited neural pathways in mice and observed their behavioral responses. When a mouse saw another mouse receiving a mild foot shock—a model of vicarious fear—its right LC-ACC circuit became highly active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when this pathway was silenced using optogenetics, the observing mouse no longer exhibited freezing behavior, a hallmark of fear. In contrast, deactivating the left-side LC had no effect on any of the fear responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further experiments confirmed that this circuit relies on β-adrenergic receptors in the right ACC, as administering a beta-blocker (propranolol) also suppressed the vicarious fear response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also traced the inputs to the LC, identifying two key upstream regions: the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the central amygdala (CeA). Notably, the BNST→LC→ACC pathway was active only during vicarious fear, whereas the CeA→LC→BLA (basolateral amygdala) pathway was involved in both direct and vicarious fear, revealing a functional split in LC processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is the first to demonstrate that the LC-NA system is functionally lateralized—meaning the brainstem itself has distinct right- and left-side roles in emotional processing. It also sheds light on how the brain differentiates between “your fear” and “mine,” providing insights into the neural basis of empathy and social learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings have significant implications for understanding and treating fear-related psychiatric conditions. Disorders such as psychopathy, antisocial personality disorder, social anxiety, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) involve disruptions in fear regulation and social cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By identifying a dedicated neural circuit for vicarious fear, this research lays the groundwork for targeted therapies aimed at restoring normal fear processing in these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also contributes to a broader understanding of brain asymmetry—the idea that different sides of the brain handle different functions. While lateralization is well-known in language and motor control, this research shows that it also plays a role in emotional processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the team plans to investigate whether similar pathways exist in the human brain. If so, this could bridge the gap between animal studies and clinical applications, potentially leading to new strategies for treating disorders related to fear and empathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By revealing how our brains distinguish between direct and observed fear, this study sheds new light on the biological basis of empathy and emotional learning. It offers exciting possibilities for developing treatments for psychiatric conditions and deepens our understanding of how emotions are wired into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6a1d03060603191f022a03081944180f440118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;William Suh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ibs.re.kr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Institute for Basic Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;William Suh – Institute for Basic Science&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-57701-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The lateralized LC-NAergic system distinguishes vicarious versus direct fear in mice&lt;/a&gt;” by SHIN Hee-sup et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lateralized LC-NAergic system distinguishes vicarious versus direct fear in mice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear can be induced either directly through self-experience of aversive events or vicariously by observing conspecifics experiencing such events.

			&lt;p&gt;Researchers from institutions across France have uncovered solid clinical evidence that supplements of &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; could be an effective treatment for the neurodegenerative condition &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350269"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Found in a small number of foods such as fatty fish, eggs, and to some degree mushrooms,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="156202" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; D is typically converted from other compounds in our body on exposure to sunlight. However we get it, the chemical plays an important role in absorbing calcium from the gut, as well as immune functions, cell growth, metabolism, and neuromuscular activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D deficiency &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2022.796933/full"&gt;has previously been identified&lt;/a&gt; as a risk factor for MS, a condition in which the body attacks the protective sheaths surrounding its own nerve cells. So researchers conducted a trial with 303 participants diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/multiple-sclerosis/cis-and-ms-whats-the-difference"&gt;clinically isolated syndrome&lt;/a&gt; (CIS); a condition that is in some ways similar to, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102262"&gt;often develops&lt;/a&gt; into, MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving just over half of the volunteers a hefty fortnightly dose of vitamin D supplements (cholecalciferol) and the other half a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="156202" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; over the course of two years, the researchers found those in the vitamin group showed fewer lesions on the brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disease activity was observed in 60.3 percent of the vitamin D group and 74.1 percent of the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156205" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156205" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/DiseaseChart.jpg" alt="Disease chart" class="wp-image-156205 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/DiseaseChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/DiseaseChart-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/DiseaseChart-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156205" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Vitamin D reduced disease activity in patients. (Thouvenot et al., &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This randomized  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="156202" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; showed that high-dose cholecalciferol monotherapy initiated within 90 days after diagnosis of CIS strongly suggestive of MS reduced disease activity significantly compared with placebo," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2831270"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were considered  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/p-value" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73101" data-postid="156202" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;statistically significant&lt;/a&gt; enough to confirm vitamin D could help prevent at least some of the damage done by CIS and MS as the immune system attacks the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers were also able to characterize the participants who saw the most improvement: those with a severe vitamin D deficiency (as you might expect), those with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"&gt;normal BMI&lt;/a&gt;, and those without any spinal lesions at the start of the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Altogether, this suggests that cholecalciferol could represent an inexpensive therapeutic alternative, with low risk of adverse events, after a CIS, especially in populations with limited access to disease-modifying therapies," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2831270"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a promising step forward for vitamin D as a potential MS treatment, though unanswered questions remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions were largely based on measures of the damage done to the central nervous system, as detected by  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="156202" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt; scans. In terms of symptoms corresponding with MS, there was a much smaller gap between the groups. What's more, the difference in relapse rates between the two groups was found to be non-significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers are also keen to run further tests on how effective this level of vitamin D dosage can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More work also needs to be done in terms of understanding the mechanisms involved here and the potential risks: we know that vitamin D can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vitamin-d-deficiency-can-trigger-autoimmune-conditions-heres-why"&gt;boost the immune system&lt;/a&gt; in certain ways, and that MS is caused by a misfiring immune system, but future studies will be needed to figure out exactly what the relationship is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts continue to find ways to cure or reverse MS, and progress is being made – in terms of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-a-single-genetic-variant-that-makes-ms-more-severe"&gt;identifying risk factors&lt;/a&gt; for the disease, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/first-of-its-kind-trial-gives-new-hope-for-treating-multiple-sclerosis"&gt;limiting the damage&lt;/a&gt; it does to the body, and understanding &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-study-gives-more-evidence-multiple-sclerosis-might-start-with-an-earlier-infection"&gt;how it gets started&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results warrant further investigation, including the potential role of pulse high-dose vitamin D as an add-on therapy," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2831270"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2831270"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Beans are so underrated for blood sugar management,” says &lt;a href="http://www.nicoleibarrard.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nicole Ibarra, RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and owner of Altitude Nutrition &amp;amp; Fitness. “They are a versatile complex carb that can be used in salads, soups, wraps or nourish bowls.” They’re also affordable, easy to prepare and packed with nutrients that might surprise you. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053850/are-beans-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Beans are a versatile and nutritious food&lt;/a&gt; that can play a key role in maintaining healthy blood sugar levels. Loved for their simplicity and packed with health benefits, they are an excellent addition to any balanced diet. Here are four ways beans can help keep your blood sugar levels in check. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; High in Fiber for Steady Blood Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking for a blood sugar-friendly carb, look no further than fiber-rich beans. What makes their fiber so beneficial? “Fiber slows the release of the carbs into your bloodstream, which stabilizes your blood sugar,” says &lt;a href="http://www.sarahgoldrd.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Sarah Anzlovar, M.S., RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian specializing in intuitive eating. And beans are an easy way to rack up lots of this blood sugar-leveling nutrient. For instance, 1 cup of canned black beans provides approximately 17 grams of dietary fiber. That’s more than half the Daily Value.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to fiber, beans boast not one but two kinds, namely soluble fiber and insoluble fiber. But their blood sugar-regulating power comes from their soluble fiber. This fiber forms a gel-like substance in the gut that slows the release of carbs into the bloodstream. That, in turn, prevents sharp spikes or crashes in blood sugar levels, promoting a more stable and gradual energy supply throughout the day. Soluble fiber is so effective that a meta-analysis of 29 studies found that it enhanced multiple measures of blood sugar control and reduced body mass index among individuals with type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Packed with Protein for Satiety &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Beans also contain protein, which plays a role in blood sugar management,” says Anzlovar.  One cup of canned beans offers approximately 15 grams of protein, depending on the variety. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What makes beans’ protein so effective? Protein takes longer to digest and metabolize than carbohydrates. As a result, consuming protein-rich foods like beans can promote satiety and help maintain steady glucose levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; There is also strong evidence that a higher dietary protein intake, particularly from plant proteins like beans, supports weight loss and improves glycemic control among people with type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Low Glycemic Index for Better Management &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans are an excellent choice for blood sugar control due to their low &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/low-glycemic-diet-vs-low-carb-diet-which-is-healthier-8559250" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;glycemic index (GI)&lt;/a&gt;. The glycemic index measures how quickly a particular food raises blood sugar levels. Research has found that eating a diet rich in low-GI foods can improve short-term blood sugar control and reduce weight and body fat in people living with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re wondering what makes beans a low-GI powerhouse, you can thank their combination of fiber and protein. Together, these nutrients slow the breakdown of carbohydrates into glucose, promoting a slow, sustained energy release.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; A Top Source of Magnesium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans are a rich source of minerals like potassium, copper, manganese and magnesium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While all of these do lots of good things for your body, it’s beans’ magnesium that plays a crucial role in blood sugar control. This mineral is essential for hundreds of biochemical processes in the body, especially blood sugar regulation. It’s so powerful that people who consume more magnesium are less likely to develop diabetes, according to the National Institutes of Health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Just 1 cup of cooked black beans provides roughly 120 milligrams of magnesium. That’s nearly 30% of the Daily Value.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swap in Beans for Meat:&lt;/strong&gt; For a plant-protein boost, sub in beans for meat in tacos, veggie burgers or chili, like our zesty &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/266448/vegan-white-bean-chili/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="7"&gt;Vegan White Bean Chili&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try Them as a Side Dish: &lt;/strong&gt;Mashed or simmered beans are a satisfying, blood sugar-friendly alternative to potatoes. Why not throw together some Instant Pot&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8044471/instant-pot-pinto-beans/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="8"&gt; pinto beans&lt;/a&gt; or&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8006211/instant-pot-black-beans/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="9"&gt; black beans&lt;/a&gt; to serve alongside roast chicken or pork? &lt;/li&gt;

Police took a report from an individual around 2:30 p.m. on Monday. The individual told police they had been attacked by a coyote on Leavensworth Road that  appeared to have porcupine quills in its mouth. It was not immediately clear if the coyote had rabies. However, Hinesburg police said the game warden had been contacted. The individual who encountered the coyote did not immediately report any injuries to police. Officials said he was seeking medical care as a precaution. The Hinesburg Police Department has asked people not to approach the animal but to call 802-482-3397 if they see it.

  &lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span class="tag-term"&gt;News Release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2025-04-01T07:30:00-04:00" class="date-display-single"&gt;Tuesday, April 1, 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Combination immunotherapy shrank a variety of metastatic gastrointestinal cancers&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;
NIH trial shows new form of TIL therapy effective against colon, rectum, pancreas, and bile duct tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new form of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy, a form of personalized cancer immunotherapy, dramatically improved the treatment’s effectiveness in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal cancers, according to results of a clinical trial led by researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The findings, published April 1, 2025 in &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03627-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;offer hope that this therapy could be used to treat a variety of solid tumors, which has so far eluded researchers developing cell-based therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This form of therapy involves identifying and selecting immune cells (TILs) that are found in the tumor that specifically recognize and attack a patient’s tumor cells. Next, scientists grow those TILs into large quantities in the laboratory before they are finally administered to the patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patients in the clinical trial, who had a variety of gastrointestinal tumors, also received the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab (Keytruda) to help further boost their immune response. The result was nearly 24% of patients treated with selected TILs plus pembrolizumab had a substantial reduction in the size of their tumors, compared with 7.7% of patients who received selected TILs without pembrolizumab. Patients treated with TILs that had not been selected for anti-tumor activity had no tumor shrinkage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We're seeing the first extension of cellular therapy with TILs into the common solid cancers,” said Steven A. Rosenberg, M.D., Ph.D., the study’s lead investigator at NIH’s National Cancer Institute. “We see a little crack in the solid wall of cancer by using cell-based immunotherapy for the common solid cancers, and we think we have ways to open that crack even further.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clinical trial included 91 patients with metastatic gastrointestinal cancers—including esophageal, stomach, pancreatic, colon, and rectal cancers—that had worsened despite a median of four prior treatment regimens. In the pilot phase of the trial, 18 patients were treated with TILs that had not been selected for anti-tumor activity, and there were no objective responses (tumor shrinkage of at least 30% is considered an objective response). In the second phase, 39 patients were treated with selected TIL therapy, and three (7.7%) had objective responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the third phase, 34 patients received pembrolizumab immediately before selected TIL therapy to prevent the newly introduced immune cells from becoming inactivated by the patient’s own immune system. This group had the best response, with 8 of 34 (23.5%) patients experiencing an objective response. All 91 patients had also received standard chemotherapy and high-dose interleukin-2 before the TIL therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the trial’s second and third phases, objective responses were seen in multiple types of gastrointestinal cancers, including cancers of the colon, rectum, pancreas, and bile duct. Responses lasted between 8 months and more than 5.8 years in the group that received selected TIL therapy alone, and between 4 months and 3.5 years in the group that received selected TIL therapy and pembrolizumab. Serious side effects occurred in 30% of patients treated with selected TILs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now developing methods to identify TILs that recognize multiple, specific proteins within a tumor, known as neoantigens, to help increase the number of patients who respond to selected TIL therapy with pembrolizumab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TIL therapy, developed in the late 1980s by Dr. Rosenberg and his colleagues at NIH, uses an individual’s own TILs to fight their tumor cells. Last year, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first TIL therapy for a solid cancer, lifileucel (Amtagvi), for treating advanced melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new study was co-led by Dr. Rosenberg and NCI investigators Frank J. Lowery, Ph.D., and Stephanie L. Goff, M.D.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;New research says antidepressants taken by millions of Americans are linked to an increased risk of sudden cardiac death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of the &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1078452?"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, presented at the European Heart Rhythm Association’s 2025 Congress, found that individuals who succumbed to an unexpected death caused by a heart-related issue had a substantially higher rate of antidepressant usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at data from all deaths in Denmark of residents aged 18 to 90 during a single year in 2010. Among the group of just over 6,000 people who experienced sudden cardiac death that year, a disproportionately high number took antidepressants. However, one demographic, ages 18 to 29, did not show a statistically significant link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis further broke down those on antidepressant medication into two buckets: individuals who took the medication for one to five years and those who took it for more than five years. Those in the first group were found to have a 56% higher risk of sudden cardiac death compared to those who were not on the medication. However, those in the second group had a 2.2 times (220%) higher risk than their non-medicated peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the study found a higher risk of cardiac death the longer someone was taking antidepressants, said study co-author Dr. Jasmin Mujkanovic of Rigshospitalet Hjertecentret, Copenhagen, Denmark, &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1078452?"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to a press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those exposed for six years or more were at even more increased risk than those exposed for one to five years, when compared with people unexposed to antidepressants in the general population.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ad post-ad"&gt;&lt;broadstreet-zone zone-id="172894" zone-alias=""&gt;&lt;/broadstreet-zone&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mujkanovic theorizes that the increase in risk could be driven by multiple factors, like the drugs themselves causing the adverse effects. She also says the exposure time to antidepressants could be an indicator of a more serious condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, the increase could be influenced by behavioral or lifestyle factors associated with depression, such as delayed healthcare seeking, and poor cardiovascular health,” said Mujkanovic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, more than 20 million adults and 3.7 million kids ages 12 to 17 have depression. Across the country, roughly one in eight people manage the condition using antidepressants, Fortune &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/medication-antidepressants-ssri-risk-cardiac-death/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But then the ring, which tracks sleep, stress and fitness using health metrics, started warning the Virginia-based resident that something in her body was wrong in the beginning of last December. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Oura ring app, which is connected to her device, started telling Gooding that she showed “major signs” of something “straining” her body. Her resting heart rate and body temperature were elevated, and her sleep scores were poor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I first got [the warning], I thought maybe I was just fighting some sort of viral illness. But then I kept getting it,” Gooding told HuffPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The continuous alerts concerned Gooding and when she discovered a lump on her neck, these warnings pushed her into making an immediate appointment with her doctor. Gooding officially got diagnosed with lymphoma and is currently undergoing chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Oura ring’s warning “definitely validated the way that I was feeling and then made me take it more seriously,” Gooding said.

The ring does not diagnose people with specific conditions, but it does share when biometrics are elevated, changing its data into an urgent red font. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it’s these red warnings that are causing people to make major health decisions, like finally making a doctor’s appointment that they might otherwise put off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;During COVID in 2020, the NBA even &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/nba-players-could-wear-a-smart-ring-to-track-covid-19-symptoms-as-season-resumes-at-disney-world/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="gave" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67eab3bae4b0ff137ab4390b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/nba-players-could-wear-a-smart-ring-to-track-covid-19-symptoms-as-season-resumes-at-disney-world/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;gave&lt;/a&gt; the Oura ring to players and league staff to wear, so that teams could catch early signs of illness and prevent community spread of COVID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this way, the Oura smart ring and similar commercial monitoring devices have evolved from trackers that just count steps and calories to becoming people’s health coaches who push people into seeking medical attention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Natalie Esparza, her Oura ring’s symptom warnings pushed her to go to the emergency room just in time. In February, when Esparza woke up vomiting and with severe stomach pain, she initially thought she had norovirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then she got the “major signs” of illness alert from her Oura, a message the app didn’t send when she actually had colds or norovirus in the past. Esparza decided to go to the emergency room, where doctors diagnosed her with appendicitis and told the California resident that if she had waited longer, it would have elevated her risk of getting sepsis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If it wasn’t for the ring telling me that [major signs alert], I wouldn’t have gone. I probably would have waited a little bit longer to go to the hospital,” Esparza said. “For me personally, [the ring’s alert] was that final push. Like, ‘No, you gotta go.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Esparza’s story mirrors the recent story of Paralympic track star Hunter Woodhall who also &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hunterwoodhall/video/7478393506948517166" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="said" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67eab3bae4b0ff137ab4390b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.tiktok.com/@hunterwoodhall/video/7478393506948517166" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a TikTok story that his Oura may have “saved” his life, because its “major signs” alert pushed him to go to a doctor and get diagnosed with appendicitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, Woodhall thought his stomach cramps were due to eating cheese and having a lactose intolerance. But because it was the first time in his four years of wearing the ring that he saw that notification, Woodhall took the Oura’s warning seriously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m so stubborn that I think without what this ring was telling me ... I don’t know if I would have gone to the hospital,” Woodhall said in his TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oura rings can be helpful health coaches. Just know that they can be wrong, too. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you read about the above anecdotes, it might make you think an Oura ring is an all-knowing health god. But temper your expectations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wearable health trackers give users an extensive report of their biometrics, but don’t mistake what it tells you for infallible knowledge. One 2024 &lt;a href="https://mhealth.jmir.org/2024/1/e56972/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="systematic review" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67eab3bae4b0ff137ab4390b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://mhealth.jmir.org/2024/1/e56972/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;systematic review&lt;/a&gt; of 28 studies of wearable health devices’ ability to detect cardiovascular conditions, COVID and physical falls, found that this technology showed the most accuracy in identifying atrial fibrillation and COVID in particular. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise physiologist Andrew Jagim, who has authored &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32734757/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="research" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67eab3bae4b0ff137ab4390b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32734757/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; on the accuracy of fitness trackers, said wearable devices can provide valuable feedback on how your body is doing “in terms of just overall physiological health.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jagim specifically pointed out a sharp decline in heart rate variability (HRV) ― which Gooding showed in her own stats before her cancer diagnosis ― as a general indication that something is wrong, he said. Heart rate variability tracks fluctuations between heartbeats, so if you suddenly have low heart rate variability, it could be a worrisome sign that your body is becoming less resilient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a sign that “you could be sick, you could be run down, stress, [you did] not get enough sleep, or sometimes all of the above,” Jagim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He likens this sensitive biometrics symptom of HRV to a “‘check engine’ light where something’s wrong with your car. You just don’t exactly know what would be the issue until you get further testing done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Esparza said the Oura ring's warning validated her concern that she should go to the emergency room for her stomach pain. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;So don’t panic if you get an alert from your wearable device that something is off. It might be because you had a hard workout the day before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jagim, who uses an Oura, said he has gotten low readiness scores from his ring after two-hour workouts. It’s a reminder that downward trends from an Oura do not necessarily indicate something is severely wrong. “It’s OK for normal fluctuations in our physiology to occur. That’s just how our body responds to stress or intense activity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, if you fly internationally, your HRV score might be low the next day because flying is stressful on the body, Jagim said. At the same time, he said that any alert about heart rate irregularity would be concerning enough for him to follow up with a health professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Jagim said that wearable technology is advancing rapidly enough that within the next five years, he expects devices to integrate their data with electronic health records, so that doctors could also get a heads up about concerning results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart health monitors can be both reassuring and panic-inducing. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these devices are not for everyone. Many people report having to take off their smart devices because the information overload causes them too much anxiety to work out or sleep in peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in Gooding’s own TikTok, people in her comments said that the “major signs” of illness language is too scary to receive. “I got [an Oura] to help with my health anxiety and it made it worse,” one TikToker &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@otikkiyousoofine/video/7478431303315000619" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="replied" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67eab3bae4b0ff137ab4390b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.tiktok.com/@otikkiyousoofine/video/7478431303315000619" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;replied&lt;/a&gt; to Gooding’s story. That’s a normal response, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise scientist and sports psychology consultant Nicole Hagobian said the majority of athletes she works with actually get more anxiety from wearable devices than they do benefits, because they fixate on the data and negatively compare their stats with their peers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People need to consider: How do I feel when I get this information on such a regular basis? It’s constant feedback,” Hagobian said. If the answer is “highly stressed,” then these smart trackers may not be for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“For me personally, [the ring’s alert] was that final push.

If you already have a diagnosed health condition, this tracker might make you feel even more stressed.

These infections disproportionately impact severely ill patients and those with weakened immune systems, including individuals undergoing cancer chemotherapy, living with HIV, and who have had organ transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Invasive fungal infections threaten the lives of the most vulnerable but countries lack the treatments needed to save lives,” said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Antimicrobial Resistance &lt;em&gt;ad interim&lt;/em&gt;. “Not only is the pipeline of new antifungal drugs and diagnostics insufficient, there is a void in fungal testing in low- and middle-income countries, even in district hospitals. This diagnostic gap means the cause of people’s suffering remains unknown, making it difficult to get them the right treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fungi in the top ‘critical priority’ category of the WHO’s  &lt;a target="_blank" href="/publications/i/item/9789240060241"&gt;fungal priority pathogens list (FPPL)&lt;/a&gt; are deadly, with mortality rates reaching as high as 88%. Advancements in treatments mean that more people are likely to be living with immunocompromised conditions, which also could mean increases in cases of invasive fungal diseases. This is a complex challenge to manage due to inaccessibility of diagnostic tools, limited availability of antifungal medicines, and a slow and complex R&amp;amp;D process for new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Constrained process in developing treatments against deadly fungal infections&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO’s &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/380498/9789240105140-eng.pdf?sequence=1" target="_blank" data-sf-ec-immutable="" data-sf-marked=""&gt;report on antifungal drugs&lt;/a&gt; highlights that, in the past decade, only four new antifungal drugs have been approved by regulatory authorities in the United States of America, the European Union or China. Currently, nine antifungal medicines are in clinical development to use against the most health-threatening fungi, as detailed in the FPPL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, only three candidates are in phase 3, the final stage of clinical development, meaning few approvals are expected within the next decade. Twenty-two drugs are in preclinical development, an insufficient number to feed a clinical pipeline considering the dropout rates, risks and challenges associated with earlier development stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issues with current antifungal treatments include serious side effects, frequent drug-drug interactions, limited dosage forms and the need for prolonged hospital stays. The report highlights the urgent need for safer antifungal medicines, possibly reducing requirements for continuous drug monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antifungal medicines that work against a wide range of severe infections caused by fungal priority pathogens are also needed. Children are particularly underserved with few clinical trials exploring paediatric dosing and age-appropriate formulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends investing in global surveillance, expanding financial incentives for drug discovery and development, funding basic research to help identify new and unexploited targets on fungi for medicines, and investigating treatments that work by enhancing patients’ immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Landscape report of diagnostics for fungal priority pathogens&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new  &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/380836/9789240105539-eng.pdf?sequence=1" data-sf-ec-immutable="" data-sf-marked=""&gt;diagnostics report&lt;/a&gt; shows that while commercially available tests exist for fungal priority pathogens, these rely on well-equipped laboratories and trained staff, which means that most people in in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) do not benefit from them. All countries, but particularly LMICs, need faster, more accurate, cheaper and easier testing for a broad range of fungal priority pathogens, including diagnostic tools that can be used at or near point-of-care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many challenges with existing antifungal diagnostics; they work only for a limited range of fungi, are insufficiently accurate and take a long time to obtain results. Most of the tests are not well suited to primary and secondary health facilities as certain diagnostics require stable electricity supplies within suitable and equipped laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health workers often have insufficient knowledge about fungal infections as well as the impact of fungi growing more resistant to treatments, resulting in limited ability to perform the testing needed to determine the appropriate treatment. WHO calls for strengthening the global response against invasive fungal diseases and antifungal resistance, and is also developing an implementation blueprint for the FPPL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an ordeal the U.S. had not endured in more than a century.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID has killed more than 7 million people, including more than 1.2 million Americans. As of Feb. 16, 2025, roughly 3,800 Americans were hospitalized due to COVID-19, according to &lt;a href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/hospitalizations?n=o"&gt;World Health Organization data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/psc/hospital-respiratory-dashboard.html#anchor_00139"&gt;Centers for Disease Control &lt;/a&gt;data shows that during the week ending March 1, the rate of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations was 1.4 per 100,000 people, significantly lower than the peak of 35.6 per 100,000 people during the 2021-22 season.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet those diagnosed with long COVID are still seeking answers. Experts don’t understand why some people develop life-changing chronic conditions after contracting COVID-19, while others do not.   &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brittanie Goldsby is a St. Louis filmmaker and creative strategist living with lingering complications, including fatigue and shortness of breath, from COVID-19. She underwent stress tests and follow-up visits with a cardiologist to determine the underlying cause of her discomfort. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsby caught COVID-19 in the spring of 2022. She assumed she would have a rough few days of flu-like symptoms highlighted by a fever, chills, and body aches. Instead, she started to feel something she wasn’t expecting – fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It wasn’t just being tired; it was like my body physically couldn’t keep up,” Goldsby said. “Even getting out of bed felt like a challenge.” She said she experienced brain fog and was in a constant daze. “I kept telling myself I’d bounce back in a couple of weeks, but that never really happened.” &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Long COVID can cause more than 200 different symptoms and affect the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, eyes and skin. Sadly, there’s no approved test for it or recommended treatment. Research shows long COVID is more common in middle-aged people, particularly women, and those with weakened immune systems. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few weeks, Goldsby expected to feel like herself again, but instead she still felt exhausted all the time. Walking short distances left her feeling out of breath. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I noticed my heart would start racing for no reason. At first, I thought I was just out of shape from being sick, but then my Apple Watch started sending me alerts that my heart rate was way too high,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsby’s research into her symptoms led her to Reddit, where she read post after post from people describing the same symptoms she was having, and these weird heart rate spikes that doctors didn’t seem to have answers for.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there are diagnostic tools to confirm symptoms of long COVID, there isn’t a test that can diagnose the condition or distinguish it from similar illnesses, the CDC says. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/long-term-effects/living-with-long-covid.html"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; LONG COVID Survey, 6% of adults in the U.S., or roughly 18 million, are estimated to be living with the damaging aftermath of catching the virus. Doctors are trying to figure out how to treat long COVID and the many areas it impacts the body. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Trying to get answers was frustrating. I went to a doctor expecting some kind of explanation, but instead, I kept hearing things like, ‘It’ll pass’ or ‘It’s probably just anxiety’”, Goldsby said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She pushed for more tests and second opinions. She finally found a doctor who acknowledged what she was going through.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The whole process made me realize how many people are probably struggling with long COVID symptoms and getting brushed off by the medical system, just like I was.” &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need to pay attention to her body and advocate for herself when something feels off has been a wake-up call for her, Goldsby said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the Trump administration terminated the Health and Human Services Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Long COVID. This could further delay the research of therapies for long COVID. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I believe shedding light on post-COVID heart health could be incredibly valuable for those navigating these issues, especially for our Black and brown communities since we are disproportionately affected,” Goldsby said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

Geier, a  well-known anti-vaccine activist who has reportedly been assigned the job of reviewing the supposed link between vaccination and autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, Geier — along with his late father, Mark— had long been &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25874402/increased-risk-for-an-atypical-autism-diagnosis-following-thimerosal-containing-vaccine-exposure-in-the-united-states-a-prospective-longitudinal-case-control-study-in-the-vaccine-safety-datalink-pubmed.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;among the promoters of that very claim&lt;/a&gt;, despite overwhelming evidence from scientifically validated research that there is no such link. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class="quote"&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="quote-body" data-long-quote&gt;It has become clear that truth and transparency are not desired by the Secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p class="quote-attribution"&gt;— Former FDA official Peter Marks, referring to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geier’s assignment to review the purported link was first &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/25/vaccine-skeptic-hhs-rfk-immunization-autism/" target="_blank"&gt;reported by the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; last week. Since then, HHS has not commented on the assignment, either to confirm or deny it. I asked Geier to confirm his assignment, and also to state whether he still believes in the link and if so, what evidence he would cite to establish it. I received no reply from the HHS or Geier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is known, however, is that Geier is an employee of HHS. In &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25874445/geier-directory.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;the agency directory&lt;/a&gt; he is listed as a “senior data analyst” with an official HHS email address, which I used to reach him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt; &lt;ps-newsletter-module class="module newsletter-module" data-id="519" data-module-id="00000195-ee23-d68c-adf7-ff37c0910011"&gt; &lt;div class="module-container"&gt; &lt;p class="module-icon"&gt; &lt;svg class="icon flying-envelope-icon"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#icon-flying-envelope"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;span class="visually-hidden"&gt;Newsletter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="module-title"&gt;Get the latest from Michael Hiltzik&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p class="module-description"&gt;Commentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="module-disclaimer"&gt; You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/ps-newsletter-module&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One other thing should be understood: Given his history with healthcare regulatory agencies, there’s no way he should be permitted anywhere near healthcare policy-making. More on that in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reported accession of Geier isn’t the only indication of how HHS, the programs of which were until recently celebrated as the gold standard of government science, has become a haven of a repugnant anti-science mythmaking and a threat to public health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Peter Marks, the top vaccine scientist at the Food and Drug Administration, announced his resignation in a scathing letter to the acting FDA commissioner, citing “the unprecedented assault on scientific truth” at the agency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Undermining confidence in well established vaccines that have met the high standards for quality, safety, and effectiveness that have been in place for decades at FDA is irresponsible, detrimental to public health, and a clear danger to our nation’s health, safety, and security,” Marks wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stated that he had tried to develop a modus vivendi with Kennedy, but “it has become clear that truth and transparency are not desired by the Secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That brings us back to Geier. He and his father, Mark, collaborated for years on articles claiming a connection between vaccines containing a compound called thimerosal as a preservative and a rise in autism diagnoses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No such connection was ever established. Studies by the Geiers that claimed to have found one were &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25874690/aap-study-fails-to-show-a-connection-between-thimerosal-and-autism.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;widely refuted&lt;/a&gt; and their methodology questioned. At least &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25874691/deer-geier.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;one paper was retracted&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Geiers ran afoul of medical regulators in Maryland, their home state. The Maryland State Board of Physicians &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25874678/md-v-mark-geier.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;revoked Mark Geier’s license to practice medicine&lt;/a&gt; in 2012, after finding that he had been treating young patients with Lupron, a drug commonly prescribed for patients with precocious puberty, and with chelation, a procedure aimed at clearing heavy metals from the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those treatments corresponded to a pet theory of the Geiers that &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25874691/deer-geier.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;autism stemmed from the interaction of mercury in thimerosal&lt;/a&gt; with testosterone, and therefore that reducing testosterone would address autism. That theory has never been scientifically validated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mercury scare related to thimerosal, moreover, was something of a red herring. Thimerosal degrades into ethylmercury, which was judged not to be a danger at the level that would come from a vaccine. No study ever established a link between thimerosal and autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address public concerns, thimerosal was removed from childhood vaccines in 2001, In any case, as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted, thimerosal was &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html" target="_blank"&gt;never present in the measles/mumps/rubella vaccine&lt;/a&gt; that was most commonly blamed for autism. Nor was it ever used in vaccines against chicken pox, polio or pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Maryland’s revocation of his license, Mark Geier’s medical license was also suspended or revoked by California, Indiana, Virginia, Texas, Missouri, Washington, Hawaii, Illinois, New Jersey, Florida and Kentucky. Geier died March 20, according to &lt;a class="link" href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/dr-mark-geier-tribute-vaccine-safety-autistic-children-advocate/" target="_blank"&gt;an obituary published by Children’s Health Defense&lt;/a&gt;, the anti-vaccine group founded by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for David Geier, the Maryland medical authorities charged him in 2011 with &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.mbp.state.md.us/BPQAPP/orders/GeierCharge05162011.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;practicing medicine without a license&lt;/a&gt;. He never had held a medical license or attended a medical school, according to the state board. But he met and consulted with an autistic patient and the patient’s mother, who apparently was under the impression that he was a doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the board, David Geier advised that the patient undergo 22 blood tests; the mother balked when lab technicians told her the blood work would require “an insane amount of blood.” The medical board &lt;a class="link" href="https://cdn.centerforinquiry.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2021/04/22173813/d_geier_order.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;fined Geier $10,000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RFK Jr.’s relationship with the Geiers dates back at least to 2005, when he cited their vaccine studies in a  discredited article he wrote titled &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25874721/deadly-immunity.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;“Deadly Immunity,”&lt;/a&gt; an anti-vax screed published by both Salon.com and Rolling Stone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both publications eventually retracted the article. In the piece, Kennedy asserted that “the Geiers have completed six studies that demonstrate a powerful correlation between thimerosal and neurological damage in children.” The correlation proved to be untrue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Geier record in itself would invalidate any “finding” from HHS claiming evidence of a vaccine-autism link. The absence of any such link is as close to settled science as one could hope for, given the volume of evidence against it. That in itself makes the HHS venture a waste of time and money, as well as a danger to public health. Anyway, why would a secretary of Health and Human Services want to put on his payroll someone found to have practiced medicine without a license?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These recent personnel moves at HHS raise the question of whether Kennedy gaslighted Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), a physician, when he pledged to Cassidy that he and Cassidy would have what Cassidy described to his colleagues as “an unprecedentedly close collaborative working relationship if [RFK Jr.] is confirmed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In explaining his vote to confirm Kennedy on Feb. 4, Cassidy said further, “We will meet or speak multiple times a month. ... Mr. Kennedy has asked for my input into hiring decisions at HHS, beyond Senate-confirmed positions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked Cassidy’s office if Cassidy actually had input into the changes and, if not, if he felt rooked by Kennedy. I haven’t received a reply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of crucial points about the supposed connection between vaccinations and autism. As &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-vaccineautism-link-20140122-story.html"&gt;I reported in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, its original source was &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(97)11096-0/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;an article published in 1998&lt;/a&gt; in the British medical journal the Lancet by a group led by physician Andrew Wakefield. The study involved 12 children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper has been retracted by the Lancet, 10 of its 12 authors have disavowed its findings, and Wakefield was stripped of his medical license in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British Medical Journal in 2011 documented how &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c5347" target="_blank"&gt;Wakefield systematically falsified the data&lt;/a&gt; about his subjects to fabricate an association between the vaccine and autism. The goal? To help a group that hoped to profit by suing the vaccine makers. The paper was “&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452" target="_blank"&gt;fatally flawed&lt;/a&gt; both scientifically and ethically,” the BMJ stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these revelations, the Wakefield study has caused no end of problems for public health. It led to a long-term decline in measles vaccinations in Britain and necessitated years of costly studies to analyze and, ultimately, refute its claims. Nevertheless, it remains the father of the vaccine-autism claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One further driver of the supposed vaccine-autism connection is that autism is far more frequently diagnosed today than in the past. Trump himself has cited this supposedly inexplicable trend. In &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/" target="_blank"&gt;a Feb. 18 executive order,&lt;/a&gt; he asserted that “autism spectrum disorder now affects 1 in 36 children in the United States — a staggering increase from rates of 1 to 4 out of 10,000 children identified with the condition during the 1980s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is that there is no mystery about the rise in autism diagnoses; it’s the result of a reconsideration of the very nature of autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Holden Thorp, the editor in chief of Science, &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25874062/thorp-utism-clean.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;wrote recently&lt;/a&gt;, “The rise in diagnoses is the result of greater awareness, better identification (especially among women and girls) and a broader definition that now includes a range of neurodevelopmental conditions under the umbrella of autism spectrum disorder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thorp didn’t come to this conclusion casually. He was diagnosed with autism — at the age of 53, seven years ago. The diagnosis prompted him to think about how thinking about autism has changed over the decades, including how the diagnosis no longer carries the stigma that it did during his childhood in the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In part that’s because of greater recognition of the diversity of autism itself — “neurodiversity,” as it’s often termed. During his childhood, he wrote, “autism was mostly diagnosed among children who had huge difficulties in daily functioning and needed extensive support. I wasn’t flagged for evaluation or diagnosis, but that might be different today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is becoming plain that Kennedy is turning HHS from a beacon of science-based medicine and public health into a hive of conspiracy theorists and, as Marks wrote, peddlers of “misinformation and lies.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 10:00:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0wFBVV95cUxNdUFWVWVYRlRxSVRKZEFaenV6M09xT1BEU3p0NktnQWU5Yy14MThVZWFQSjNfa3lzaldXOHo3RGRYZVpYU2FqNjRwTGk4Z0xFMDZwUFRDdnpBRTFMbmlKNnllT3ZaSkpXVklOWkw3cE5SU0pUcEVId3Foa2tmM0F1WUYzbXR5Q2FEdU0xeW85VWFOblNydlRRNS1pTnlkZDgwSU9WZEs5bURRbGJDWVAyY2JicXFsMl8ycG8yWXljTFoxVHBzSUhFWUt6VHUxYWVxZm1J</guid></item><item><title>The missing women of autism are differently different - Aeon</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxPdW15b2hISFk1OUo5dllubm1HdDVFQ3A4UHN0UzFRV0haMzJsd1BfTmZqQTFjdG15NF83LXFZclRCZ1RPMVpmYXN3eXVnZGV6M21BUVJpVEVfT2s1LUhyWF9PV3lwWWZ0YnJoUHAzaUprNjBXTGVOaTBBYzNXRVlXa1Vn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-4ebaf8b7-2 cLLLmT has-dropcap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you know that boys are 10 times more likely to be referred for an autism diagnosis than girls? Or that boys who are referred for an autism diagnosis are more than &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00127-010-0294-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt; as likely to be &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27940569/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diagnosed&lt;/a&gt; as autistic as are girls who have been referred? But this shouldn’t be surprising, as ‘autism is a male problem’, right? Almost every autism-related website, research paper or journal article tells us that autism occurs much more frequently in boys, on average about four times as often, although ratios of 15:1 have sometimes been quoted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But suppose you were told that teachers, presented with identical vignettes of hypothetical children, are more &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32488964/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;likely&lt;/a&gt; to identify the child as autistic and in need of support if the child is called ‘Jack’ than if the child is called ‘Chloe’. That girls who are eventually diagnosed as autistic may wait several more years than boys to be &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34868805/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;assessed&lt;/a&gt;. That research shows that up to &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;80 per&lt;/span&gt; cent of autistic females may initially receive an inappropriate diagnosis – of social anxiety, or an eating disorder, or borderline personality disorder – before it is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8870038/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recognised&lt;/a&gt; that they are autistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these missing autistic women have found their voices. There is an online forum for late-diagnosed autistic women called the Late Discovered Club. And over the past decade, we’ve seen powerful personal testimonies from women who have been told autism was ‘just for men’. As one mother &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5993544/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: ‘I kept asking to have her evaluated, but with her being a girl, it was even less likely that the paediatrician would refer us. I remember her saying that this is usually a boys’ thing and she is only a little different.’ Now the mountain is a bit easier to climb. All in all, the newly diagnosed women reveal a flaw in our understanding of what autism is, fundamentally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;hy and how were autistic women sidelined? On one level, a fixed belief in the maleness of autism was so strong that some researchers &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36778135/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hunted&lt;/a&gt; for a ‘female protective effect’ or &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12039606/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blamed&lt;/a&gt; autism on an ‘extreme male brain’. On top of that, gendered socialisation has driven autistic women underground, causing them to disguise and internalise their struggles, and depriving them of the help they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with bias in the research itself. A 2021 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8436080/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; found that, in more than 1,400 studies investigating autistic brains, more than &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;30 per&lt;/span&gt; cent studied only males. My own 2024 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11177439/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; reported that, of more than 100 studies on brain models of autism, nearly &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;70 per&lt;/span&gt; cent tested only males (or included just one or two females). Of more than 4,000 autistic participants in these studies, fewer than &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;10 per&lt;/span&gt; cent were female. Early versions of ‘big data sets’, where results were combined to increase their scale and scope, also highlight the male spotlight problem. The first &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/mp201378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE-I), launched in 2012 and containing fMRI brain scan and other data from more than 539 diagnosed individuals, reported only on analyses of 360 males. Scrutiny of the full ABIDE cohort, moreover, revealed that 485 &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;(88 per&lt;/span&gt; cent) of the data sets were from males and &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;25 per&lt;/span&gt; cent of the sites invited to participate had excluded females ‘by design’. When it comes to finding an explanation for autism, maleness was the only place many researchers looked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did this happen? ‘Science is a bit like the joke about the drunk who is looking under a lamppost for a key that he has lost on the other side of the street, because that’s where the light is,’ Noam Chomsky said back in 1993. And all along, autism researchers have suffered from this ‘streetlight’ effect, falsely shining their light only on males.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;The film &lt;em&gt;Rain Man&lt;/em&gt; provided an instant stereotype of autism that powerfully influenced public consciousness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet being male has never been part of any autism diagnosis in the formal sense. In 1943, Leo Kanner, one of the so-called ‘fathers of autism’, &lt;a href="https://autismtruths.org/pdf/Autistic%20Disturbances%20of%20Affective%20Contact%20-%20Leo%20Kanner.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; 11 cases of what he called ‘early infantile autism’ – eight were boys, three were girls. But as cases of ‘Kanner’s syndrome’ accumulated, epidemiological surveys reported far greater prevalence in boys. Hans Asperger, writing at the same time as Kanner, made more of the maleness of the condition, referring to ‘an extreme variant of male intelligence’. His seminal &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1992-97284-002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; focused on just four boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the profile of autism was broadened in the 1980s, diagnoses increased so much that there was talk of an epidemic. Yet female diagnoses remained low, with some reporting male-female ratios of just &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;6-7 per&lt;/span&gt; cent. The film &lt;em&gt;Rain Man&lt;/em&gt; (1988), with Dustin Hoffman depicting an autistic savant with both extraordinary skills and bewildering behavioural problems, provided an instant stereotype of autism that powerfully influenced public consciousness of the condition. The picture of autism just didn’t include girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical of self-fulfilling prophecies, the male spotlight was switched on. Committees of diagnosticians painstakingly drew up checklists of commonly occurring signs and symptoms, generating lengthy profiles of ‘typical’ autistic behaviour. So-called ‘gold standard’ tests became near compulsory, not only for a universally accepted &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11055457/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;, but also for inclusion in &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4419-1698-3_894" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; studies. And embedded in these assessment schedules was a pre-existing, circular problem. They were all derived from close attention to individuals who had already been diagnosed, the majority of whom were male. Parents might be asked about unusually intense, nerdy ‘boy-type’ interests: historical facts, calendar dates, makes of cars. Clinicians were asked to note ‘loner’ type behaviour: lack of eye contact, failure to engage with others. No tick boxes for more socially normal ‘girl-type’ interests, such as Barbie dolls or ponies, or red flags for apparently normal social exchanges that might, on closer analysis, come across as slightly stilted, even scripted – all hallmarks of autistic girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;t was not until the beginning of the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;21st century&lt;/span&gt; that a wave of powerful personal testimonies from late-diagnosed autistic women eventually raised awareness of this gap in the autism story. Autistic women had found their voice and made clear their omission was not just a matter of not being truly autistic. Books with telling titles such as &lt;em&gt;Odd Girl Out: An Autistic Woman in a Neurotypical World&lt;/em&gt; (2017) by Laura James, or &lt;em&gt;Autism in Heels: The Untold Story of a Female Life on the Spectrum&lt;/em&gt; (2018) by Jennifer Cook O’Toole revealed lifelong struggles as an outsider in a bewildering, highly socialised, world. There were stories of being ostracised, bullied and ‘othered’, of being terrified to be spotted as different, of struggling fruitlessly to understand the invisible rules of social engagement that allowed others to effortlessly understand each other, form friendship groups and be popular. And of constantly being rebuffed when seeking help – ‘girls don’t get autism’, ‘you can’t be autistic, you make eye contact’, and ‘you don’t look autistic’. Stories of parents being told their daughters were ‘just shy’, and their adult selves diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, or generalised anxiety disorder, or depression, or eating disorders – clinicians missing the fundamental diagnosis: autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of all this, research woke up as well, offering a much-needed &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4284309/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;framework&lt;/a&gt; for sex and gender differences. Scientists began proactively recruiting females into their research cohorts, rather than &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9804357/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;avoiding&lt;/a&gt; them altogether or statistically screening them out as part of the ‘noise’ in their data. They were pressed to design research protocols that would actively identify aspects of autism that varied between males and females. It had become clear that there was a need to move away from the ‘less than’ approach based on a male template, with autistic females described as ‘less’ socially impaired than autistic males, or ‘less’ likely to show repetitive behaviours or highly focused interests than males. Researchers needed to acknowledge that the male spotlight problem in autism research meant that, when it came to autistic females, they had been looking in the wrong place and asking the wrong questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;The camouflager might come across as extremely shy. The masquerader might come across as an extravert&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are autistic females really different? The most startling answer concerns the very nature of autism, supposedly signalled by intentional social avoidance and elective isolation. Once there was a closer look at females on the spectrum, a core aspect of &lt;em&gt;their &lt;/em&gt;social behaviour was found to be, conversely, an intense focus on finding ways to &lt;em&gt;ensure&lt;/em&gt; social contact with others, of obsessively trying to find ways to fit in, to belong. Part of this was a powerful fear of being spotted as different, resulting in a lifelong &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5509825/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pattern&lt;/a&gt; of exhaustive and exhausting attempts at camouflage, of devising ways to blend in, of ‘putting on their best normal’. This drive might entail closely watching facial expressions or gestures, mimicking styles of speech, or even generating scripts by listening to others’ verbal social exchanges and repetitively rehearsing them in secret. Interviewed for my new book, one late-diagnosed woman explained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;When I was a young child, I went through a phase where I was terrified of going first in any group activity (and would have meltdowns if I was asked to do so). In hindsight, I was terrified at the prospect of having to demonstrate a behaviour without first being able to observe and copy an ‘acceptable’ model of that behaviour.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their painful struggles might be disguised by creating many different identities or masks that they could hide behind, masks that they hoped would allow them to join the gang, to be accepted as part of a social group. The camouflager might come across as extremely shy or quiet, never putting themselves forward, the girl in the corner, quietly tucking herself away from view. The masquerader, on the other hand, might come across as an extravert, or the performer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘I had been the geek, the book lover, the dancer, the academic, the sports fanatic, the food guru, the makeup expert. I had been whoever I needed to be,’ explains Katy Wells in her book &lt;em&gt;The Painted Clown&lt;/em&gt; (2021). ‘Whichever role I had played, had depended on who I had been with. My personas changed so readily. My survival had depended on my ability to adapt, to perform… to mask.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the unfolding story of autism, these behaviours had never served as any kind of red flag, and so these camouflaging chameleons, as they have been dubbed, remained unnoticed and overlooked – hiding in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ld-embed-block-wrapper"&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://youtube.com/embed/VJHa9xk16Hw" class="ld-embed-block"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;figcaption class="ld-embed-caption"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, these undercover activities did not lead to a happy and successful life, filled with contented membership of multiple social groups. Once clinicians and researchers started to pay attention, they &lt;a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/32429817" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that camouflaging behaviour was linked to high levels of depression and anxiety, suicidal ideation and self-harm. Personal testimonies describe years of mental health crises, associated with multiple misdiagnoses, inappropriate treatment and medication, an ‘alphabet soup of diagnoses’, until the pieces fell into place and an autism assessment was finally suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ld-embed-block-wrapper"&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://youtube.com/embed/VzWorS8CdBM" class="ld-embed-block"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;figcaption class="ld-embed-caption"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is now a move to identify camouflaging behaviour, to spot a possible disconnect between someone’s outward appearance of coping and their inner signs of struggle – or even, in a break with traditional autism assessments, of actually asking the people concerned if and how they struggled with social situations. Did they consciously try to maintain eye contact for a certain amount of time? Did they make a note of social gestures and other non-verbal cues and then practise them in front of a mirror? Camouflaging, by definition, is hard to spot, but at least now practitioners and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30361940/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; who might help are looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he new insights have triggered a reset in autism neuroscience research. In the early part of this century, there was an understandable focus on investigating atypical activity in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18771388/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;so-called&lt;/a&gt; social brain. This is a network of brain structures underpinning those skills needed to connect with other people, such as understanding what they might be thinking, getting pleasure from successful social interchanges or finding ways to avoid situations that might lead to social rejection. The early conclusions from such research, when applied to autism, was that it was associated with atypically low levels of activity in the social brain showing, for example, reduced coding of social cues, or an underactive social reward system, with limited signs of affective responsivity to social experiences, negative or positive. This fitted neatly with the accepted view of autistic individuals as asocial loners. But, as we know, these conclusions were based on an era of ‘men-only’ studies. What happened when you started testing women too? Evidence of an &lt;em&gt;over&lt;/em&gt;-active social brain emerged, indicating high levels of anxious self-monitoring in social situations and powerful affective responses to social rejection. A very different picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises the idea that autistic women have been missed not because they generally show milder versions of the fundamental signs of autism, as found in males, or because they are better at hiding such signs, but because &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; autism presents in a different way. Far from avoiding social interaction, it appears they are powerfully driven to seek it. However, in common with the traditional view of autism, they appear to lack the necessary skill-set to successfully achieve such interaction. They have the motivation, but not the means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a different type of autism, but autism nonetheless. Here, there is a powerful drive for social contact, so strong that elaborate (and ultimately damaging) camouflaging schema are developed to disguise any clues that these masqueraders might not fit into the social groups they seek to join. Such camouflaging behaviour makes the underlying struggles harder to spot, but they are there, and the clinical guidelines and diagnostic definitions need to be revised to reflect this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;The evidence is that the autism community itself is characterised by high levels of gender variance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/observations/is-it-time-to-give-up-on-a-single-diagnostic-label-for-autism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;suggestion&lt;/a&gt; that we need to move away from the all-embracing concept characterised by the spectrum approach, and re-introduce the notion of subtypes, such as &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;Type 1&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;Type 2&lt;/span&gt; autism, along the lines of disorders such as diabetes. Should these distinctions be couched in terms of a male autism phenotype and a female autism phenotype, given that most of the ‘Kanners’ are males and most of the ‘chameleons’ are female?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably not. There are some females who present with Kanner-type autism, as well as males who present with camouflaging behaviours. We should avoid repeating past mistakes arising from the inaccurate and simplistic grouping of so many aspects of human brains and behaviour into allegedly distinct ‘male’ and ‘female’ categories, especially in the face of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24619651/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that the autism community itself is characterised by high levels of gender variance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have suggested that chameleon-type autism is so different, it does not really fit on the spectrum at all. But that overlooks the core defining feature of autism, a distinctive difficulty with the fundamental human drive to be social, involved with the same brain networks. This can be harnessed as both a theoretical and an applied framework by attempts to understand, and ameliorate if necessary, the many manifestations of autism. Instead of finding a different home for an emerging group who don’t fit the traditional pattern, we must widen our understanding of autism yet again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of the most important lessons is that this story would not have emerged so effectively if autistic women had not found their voices, and if insightful autism &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9645671/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; had not listened to them. The importance of formally including and understanding ‘lived experience’ in all aspects of autism research is being acknowledged; the autism community is now leading this addition of participatory research when investigating atypical behaviour. Autistic individuals are being included as partners in all aspects of the research process, from design and recruitment through to interpretation and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incorporating this unique type of expertise could bring equal benefits to other areas of atypical behaviour. Evidence of male bias in autism diagnosis raises a general question about the reliability of psychiatric categories as a whole. The fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s&lt;em&gt; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders &lt;/em&gt;(2013) is several inches thick and runs to approximately 1,000 pages; psychiatric diagnosis is not an exact, unbiased science. This matters. The labels generated by consulting such tomes have real-life consequences for ensuring access to support and understanding. They also have very significant consequences both for research programmes and the development of therapeutic practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is beginning to emerge, for &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11920-017-0791-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;, that significant numbers of patients with eating disorders are autistic, and that they form a group that is qualitatively and quantitatively different from eating-disordered patients who are not autistic. So, understanding this overlap, and being able to correctly identify the characteristics of the two groups, should be better enabled by the diagnostic process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, no matter what the presentation, an eventual diagnosis of autism appears to have a powerfully positive impact on the lives and self-image of late-diagnosed females. A common theme in many personal testimonies is the relief at ‘finally finding my tribe’, with exclamations that ‘my life finally made sense’ or ‘I’m not a broken neurotypical. I’m a healthy autistic me!’ So, however flawed the definition of autism currently is, it represents a real and recognisable community to a group for whom ‘belonging’ is the prime driver of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;hat does the discovery of autism’s missing women tell us about wider issues of gendered socialisation and its uneven impact on females and males? ‘Many of the moments when my autism caused problems, or at least marked me out as different, were those moments when I had come up against some unspoken law about how a girl or woman should be, and failed to meet it,’ wrote Joanne Limburg in &lt;em&gt;Letters to My Weird Sisters&lt;/em&gt; (2021).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In trying to understand the ‘why’ of camouflaging, we need to discover what forces have driven a considerable number of autistic individuals, many of them women, to spend their developing years struggling to hide their autism. Why should a sub-set of the autistic population be apparently compelled to do everything they can to be part of a social group, even though their efforts result in physical and mental exhaustion and distress, and even render them vulnerable to abusive and damaging relationships?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it relevant that most of these individuals are female? Are we looking at the playing out of a biological &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7777651/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;script&lt;/a&gt;, genetically and hormonally determined, that drives females more powerfully than males to prioritise social group membership or ‘belongingness’ above many other aspects of psychological wellbeing? Or are we looking at the impact of a culturally determined social training &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21803468/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;regime&lt;/a&gt;, encouraging low-profile compliance and conformity, careful camouflaging of any unusual traits, or compulsive internalising of any socially disruptive traits? Or are these alternatives inextricably entangled? As is often the case when studying human behaviour, sometimes it is the exceptions that can offer insights into so-called neurotypical rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an ironic footnote here. Some critics of neuroscience research into gender differences express &lt;a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/srichard/publications/autism-biomedical-platform-sex-difference-research" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;concern&lt;/a&gt; that focusing solely on biological sex as the source of such differences might support negative sexist stereotyping. On the other side of the coin, the alleged ‘maleness’ of autism is often cited as proof that there are indeed irrefutable (and unchallengeable) differences between the brains of women and the brains of men, so biological sex must be the source of such differences. The first group diminishes the concept of sex differences in the brain. The second group embraces the maleness of a brain-based condition such as autism as proof that the ‘female brain’ and the ‘male brain’ are real. At the nexus of these debates is autism’s male spotlight, which has cast a long shadow on our culture and consumed so much light we’ve been unable to fully focus on the whole picture of autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Their autism may itself be disguised by other conditions such as self-harm or eating disorders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, finally, the ‘lost girls’ thread goes back further than we thought. It has emerged that the so-called fathers of autism were actually trumped by a Russian female psychiatrist, Grunya Sukhareva, who published finely detailed descriptions of autistic children in the 1920s. She quite explicitly drew comparisons between boys with autism and girls with autism. Her work was broadly overlooked until just &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00787-021-01875-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;two years ago&lt;/a&gt;. Yet another ‘missing woman’!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now know that autistic women have been missing from autism headcounts because no-one was looking for them (the male spotlight problem) and because they were in disguise (the camouflaging problem). What next? How can we ensure that no-one goes missing again, and help these newer members of the autism community when they realise who &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;they are?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must challenge the gatekeepers, such as the teachers who believe ‘only boys have autism’, the clinicians who think ‘girls don’t get autism’, the diagnosticians who set up boy-based templates for defining autistic behaviour, the researchers who assume that their men-only findings will suffice as explanations for autism as a whole. We must raise awareness that ‘autism is not just for males anymore’ and that the ‘white, nerdy, male’ stereotypes of autism (both professional and popular) are just a subtype of a much larger group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autism professionals and support groups need to be aware that the lived experiences of chameleon-type autists are different from those of the Kanner group. Their obsessive need to belong at any cost makes them especially vulnerable to the type of bullying that is based on social ostracism and to abusive relationships. Their autism may itself be disguised by other conditions such as self-harm or eating disorders, which clinicians should be aware of. Therapeutic support must be geared to help the camouflagers and masqueraders, &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the psychologist Damian Milton has &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09687599.2012.710008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; a double empathy problem, the mutual misunderstanding between autistic and neurotypical individuals. The bewilderment experienced by autistic individuals in the social world of neurotypicals is matched by neurotypical lack of awareness of what it is like to experience the world so differently and how hard it can be to understand the social rules of engagement that govern successful and rewarding interactions with each other. Efforts to increase neurotypical understanding of autism now need to embrace autistic sisters as well as brothers for a broader, more nuanced view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have explored the many reasons why girls and women have been missing in the history of autism, and why it matters. We have found our way behind their masks and spotted their differently different autistic behaviour. We have finally welcomed them into our scanners and mapped their differently different brains. Hopefully, we can now make the world a better place for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Aeon</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 10:00:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPdW15b2hISFk1OUo5dllubm1HdDVFQ3A4UHN0UzFRV0haMzJsd1BfTmZqQTFjdG15NF83LXFZclRCZ1RPMVpmYXN3eXVnZGV6M21BUVJpVEVfT2s1LUhyWF9PV3lwWWZ0YnJoUHAzaUprNjBXTGVOaTBBYzNXRVlXa1Vn</guid></item><item><title>2 SC cities face rising STD rates, among highest in US for 2025, study shows.

It is more likely to impact the elderly and people who already are ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have certainly seen it,” said Wu, chief epidemiologist and system director for infectious diseases at &lt;a href="https://hartfordhealthcare.org/"&gt;Hartford HealthCare&lt;/a&gt;, noting that an infection with the fungus “is very dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2023/p0320-cauris.html"&gt;The Los Angeles Times reported last week that the Georgia Department of Public Health recently reported a surge in cases in health care facilities, and a recent study found an alarming rate of spread in Florida hospitals.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="tqegJJLPXr"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/2025/03/27/candida-auris-fungus-cdc/"&gt;Deadly, drug-resistant fungus CDC calls ‘urgent threat’ is spreading in hospitals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, as stories circulate about the potentially deadly fungus spread in hospitals and senior care facilities across the country, Wu said it is important that people understand that this organism is present in many places and it is not making people sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it causes infection, that is when we start to worry,” Wu said. If it’s spread in a hospital setting or nursing home, that would be a problem, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The biggest concern is that it is transmissible and can develop resistance to anti-fungal medication very quickly,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But hospitals in Connecticut are well aware of this, watch for signs of infections in patients and are in regular contact with the &lt;a href="https://portal.ct.gov/dph/epidemiology-and-emerging-infections/candida_auris"&gt;state Department of Health,&lt;/a&gt; which also is knowledgeable and prepared, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DPH notes that it collaborates with the &lt;a href="https://portal.ct.gov/dph/laboratory/laboratory-home/katherine-a-kelley-state-public-health-laboratory"&gt;Katherine A. Kelley State Public Health Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/antimicrobial-resistance-laboratory-networks/php/about/domestic.html"&gt;CDC Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory Networ&lt;/a&gt;k to “provide Connecticut health care facilities with rapid and accurate identification of Candida auris and appropriate infection control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I will give credit to the state,” Wu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu, as does the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/candida-auris/tracking-c-auris/index.html?2023=All%20Years"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, said hospitals and nursing homes use early case detection techniques, patient screening, and strict compliance with infection prevention and control practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are prepared for it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state Department of Health&lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/2019/04/09/health-officials-connecticut-patient-with-dangerous-drug-resistant-fungus-is-better/"&gt; investigated Connecticut’s first case of Candida auris in June 2017&lt;/a&gt; in an acute care hospital. The person who contracted it may have picked it up in another county, &lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/2019/04/09/health-officials-connecticut-patient-with-dangerous-drug-resistant-fungus-is-better/"&gt;health department officials said in 2019. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu said hospitals are able to identify people who may be at risk by asking questions about travel and length of travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We get alerted and look for it,” he said, and if needed, patients can be placed in isolation while tests are done. “We try to be preventative.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu said candida auris can be on surfaces and can be spread through fecal matter, but is not spread in an airborne way. Sanitation is crucial, he said, and part of this is “good hand hygiene.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC noted that candida auris can cause “infection in different parts of the body like the blood, wounds, and ears” and that symptoms “depend on the location and severity of infection. Symptoms may be similar to symptoms of infections caused by bacteria like fever or chills,” but there is “not a common set of symptoms specific for C. auris infections.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu said he is concerned about cuts at the federal level when it comes to agencies dealing with health, as, if there is a “lack of flow of information we are going to be handcuffed.”  He said even the state DPH gets a lot of information from the federal level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TYo88JM6LX"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/2025/03/13/five-years-later-pandemic-response-fears-return/"&gt;Five years ago, COVID gripped the world in fear. Now scientists, doctors warn Trump’s policies are weakening public health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That flow of information is very important,” Wu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu has previously expressed concern about the spread of misinformation when it comes to health care issues,&lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/2025/03/28/texas-measles-outbreak-jumps-to-400-cases-including-more-cases-in-northeast-texas/"&gt; including about vaccinations.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu said the same concern applies to the withdrawal of the United States from the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, “as then we are not getting information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/"&gt;White House order about the WHO withdrawal&lt;/a&gt; says the Secretary of State and the director of the Office of Management and Budget must “identify credible and transparent United States and international partners to assume necessary activities previously undertaken by the WHO.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu said he does not think Connecticut residents should be alarmed about the candida fungus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They should not be fearful, but they should be very respectful,” he said, noting again the importance of good hygiene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu has recently noted his concern about the recent &lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/2025/03/14/measles-cases/"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; cases and death that have occurred in the nation, which he said were preventable. He added that he sees mistrust in science and &lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/2025/03/14/rfk-jr-s-first-month-as-health-secretary-touting-french-fries-and-casting-doubts-on-vaccines/"&gt;mistrust in vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, “is like driving without a seatbelt,” and he supports vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;

And constant soreness is not something to strive for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“A common misconception is that soreness means a workout was effective,” said Cedric Bryant, an exercise physiologist and the president and chief executive of the American Council on Exercise. “While some soreness is normal, it is not a requirement for muscle growth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-3a8eefd"&gt;What Sore Muscles Mean&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;When your muscles feel sore a day or two after exercise, it’s typically because of microscopic tears in your muscle fibers that can &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/well/move/inflammation-exercise.html" title=""&gt;lead to inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and pain, said Laura Richardson, an exercise physiologist at the University of Michigan School of Kinesiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;As your muscles repair during the days afterward, the pain dissipates, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Muscles also often grow stronger after soreness, but that discomfort is certainly not required for muscle growth, Dr. Bryant added. Many athletes do not get sore after workouts, even when they are continuing to improve their fitness and build muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“This does not mean the workout was ineffective,” Dr. Bryant said. It is usually a sign that their muscles have adapted to a regular training routine and have become “more efficient at handling the workload,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Putting underpants on with bare feet could put millions at risk of a gruesome and embarrassing groin infection, a top doctor has warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So-called 'crotch rot' is caused by the fungus, tinea corporis, commonly known as ringworm, and appears as scaly, itchy and sometimes red skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And according to Dr Samuel Choudhury, a GP who specialises in skincare, the infection often spreads to the genital area via the feet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a video shared to his 450,000 &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-e41f1720-0ece-11f0-8576-2bac6e02ea97"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; followers Dr Choudhury warned that foot ringworm is incredibly common — affecting around 70 per cent of people 'at least once in their life'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And studies show that around 20 per cent will, at some point, suffer the same infection in the groin area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Choudhury explained that underwear comes into contact with the fungal spores on the feet, and carries them up to the groin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So this is what you need to do to avoid jock itch [crotch infection],' he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Not wearing underwear is not the solution, but wearing your socks first is. It acts as a barrier so you contain the infection.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added that those who suffer persistent jock itch should 'think about' the state of their feet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-1fa2a840-0ed2-11f0-8576-2bac6e02ea97" class=""&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; guidance echoes Dr Choudhury's warnings, advising that fungal groin infeections are usually caused by reinfection from other parts of the body, like hands or feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have shown that young men are the most likely to suffer, as well as those who work in &lt;span&gt;high temperature environments, wear tight fitting clothing or are obese.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These fungi naturally live on your skin and typically don't cause problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, wearing sweat-soaked clothes after exercising can lead to prolonged exposure to moisture, allowing the fungi to multiply quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jock itch, sometimes referred to as 'crotch rot' is contagious for as long as the fungal spores are living on the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These spores can even live on surfaces like bedding and towels for over a year if they aren't washed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Advice to treat the infection includes washing affected skin areas daily, making sure to dry thoroughly as well as avoiding scratching and washing clothes and bedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If symptoms don't improve with home treatments, experts advise contacting the doctor for advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors will typically prescribe an anti- fungal cream such as hydrocortisone and/or an oral anti-fungal if the infection gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The medicine, lenacapavir, made by Gilead Sciences, has caused a stir because clinical trial data showed a single set of injections every six months could provide virtually complete protection against infection, a form of prevention known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or (PrEP). The drug, which is under regulatory review, has raised hopes that the deadly infectious disease can be mitigated around the globe. Early data for an even newer formulation suggest it might need to be given only once a year. “This is magical,” UNAIDS chief Winnie Byanyima &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/science-speaks-blog/2024/aids-2024-miracle-long-acting-injectable-provides-100-protection-against-hiv-researchers-find/#/+/0/publishedDate_na_dt/desc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; last year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, has been poised to play the leading role in making lenacapavir available, given its experience distributing HIV prevention drugs around most of the world.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last December, PEPFAR and The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria crafted an arrangement to cover dosing for 2 million people over three years in dozens of low and middle-income countries. This closely followed a voluntary licensing deal that Gilead Sciences reached with six companies to make low-cost, generic versions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The effort is widely seen as a key step in a widely shared goal to eradicate HIV and AIDS by 2030. For this reason, global health advocates warn that, by threatening to pull PEPFAR funding, the U.S. could squander a pivotal moment in a pandemic that still infects 1 million new people every year. For the first time, a vaccine-esque intervention is available, they say, if people can actually get the medication.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“It’s tragic because it’s coming at the worst possible moment,” said Mitchell Warren, who heads the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, or AVAC, a nonprofit that receives backing from PEPFAR and recently filed a &lt;a href="https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/ECF-1-Complaint-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; in hopes of preventing the Trump administration from proceeding with global funding cuts. “In 44 years of this epidemic, we’ve never had an opportunity like lenacapavir.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Indeed, PEPFAR plays a crucial role in combating HIV around the world. The U.S. agency is responsible for providing approximately 90% of the HIV prevention efforts globally, including services, according to Jirair Ratevosian, an associate research scientist at Yale, who is a former acting chief of staff at PEPFAR and also a former executive director of corporate social responsibility at Gilead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Trump Administration, however, recently halted much of PEPFAR’s funding as part of a wider — and highly controversial — move to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID. After public outcry, though, Secretary of State Marco Rubio signed a waiver in January to keep parts of PEPFAR funded for 90 days. The State Department operates PEPFAR.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last week, meanwhile, a one-year congressional authorization for PEPFAR expired, making its future uncertain, even though Congress appropriated funding through the end of September by way of a continuing resolution that recently passed. For the moment, nothing is likely to get decided about PEPFAR’s future until the Trump administration completes its review by April 20.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Right now, no prevention is happening. I’m hoping prevention isn’t seen as optional, but as a historic opportunity to create prevention tools people want and need,” said Ratevosian. “But if PEPFAR’s posture is curtailed and its budget is cut in any significant way after the foreign aid review, I don’t see how PEPFAR could prioritize executing on distributing lenacapavir.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;STAT asked the State Department for comment. A Gilead spokesperson said: “We are monitoring current developments, and support efforts to continue to prioritize access to vital tools such as HIV prevention medications so together, we can achieve the global goal of ending the HIV epidemic.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To be sure, lenacapavir is not the only worry among advocates and health policy experts. PEPFAR disburses $6 billion to $7 billion each year for antiretroviral drugs, outreach workers, educational and other services. Overall, the program is estimated to have saved 26 million lives since its inception in 2003, but its sudden and chaotic defunding&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;jeopardizes millions of lives across Africa and the Caribbean.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is not surprising that the Gilead drug is garnering considerable attention. Unlike pills for preventing HIV, a highly effective, long-acting injectable offers the promise of broader protection by easing compliance. To date, the only other such injectable is sold by ViiV Healthcare, although it must be administered every two months, compared with twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After Gilead released its trial data last year, Francois Venter, who runs an infectious disease research clinic at University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, said the results became the center of instant conversation. In some sub-Saharan countries, the drug may have a slower impact, because health infrastructure is weaker. But in South Africa, he said, it could “break the back of the epidemic.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Nombeko Mpongo, a patient advocate and community liaison in Cape Town who helped design the study, agreed. She contracted HIV after she was raped in 1997, when the virus was still a death sentence spreading widely through South Africa, and saw lenacapavir as the kind of tool that could protect her children and grandchildren. She spent months educating schools and NGOs about it. Now, though, “we don’t even know when and how we’re going to get it,” she said. “It’s a disaster.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anticipation grew still higher last month when Gilead Sciences released fresh data showing that a new formulation of its drug could provide virtually complete protection against infection with just a single administration every year — and make an even greater contribution to ending the HIV epidemic. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The collaboration between PEPFAR and the Global Fund — which would also involve the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation and the Gates Foundation — was seen as a way to fulfill such promise. The stated goal is to get doses distributed as widely as possible and show generic manufacturers a significant market exists so they are encouraged to scale quickly and thus lower costs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It stirred excitement among global health advocates. Oral PrEP and ViiV’s medicine were slow to reach much of the world, in part because resources weren’t deployed to scale and broadly distribute them, and PrEP usage remains well below UN targets.  The agreement’s goal was to “ensure that the world doesn’t squander this opportunity as it did each of the last PrEP launches over the last 15 years,” said Warren, whose group consulted on the deal. Meanwhile, there is confusion about how widely work has been able to resume, given the sudden lack of resources. And the Rubio waiver specifically called for PEPFAR to only fund prevention for pregnant and breastfeeding women, leaving out vulnerable populations such as adolescent girls and young men who have sex with men. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A PEPFAR official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the situation, said they assume the administration will adopt a similar policy going forward. That could permit access to the drug in wealthy nations, but “you essentially have no ability to implement lenacapavir” where the bulk of infections occur, according to Chris Beyrer, Director of the Duke Global Health Institute.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, The Global Fund is hoping to find a way to proceed. Peter Sands, who heads the public-private partnership last month told Bhekisisa Centre for Health Journalism, a nonprofit media group based in South Africa, that “we are still maintaining our ambition on lenacapavir” even if the rollout is on a smaller scale. “We cannot afford to miss such a game-changing opportunity,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To what extent The Global Fund can make good on its ambition is unclear. The organization is in the midst of trying to raise $18 billion to continue its mission for the next three years. A big unknown, at least for the moment, is whether donors will provide enough money to compensate for the PEPFAR cuts. Other countries have also cut their foreign assistance budgets, adding to the uncertainty. A spokeswoman for The Global Fund declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In hope of moving HIV prevention forward, UNAIDS’ Byanyima late last month argued that ensuring lenacapavir is available is a “deal not to be missed.” How so? She noted the drug is an American innovation that could yield profits for Gilead if it licenses the medicine as planned. In doing so, this would not only create jobs for Americans, but save millions of lives in poor countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She maintained that this could only happen, though, if the Trump administration sees that this is, in effect, a good deal. “It is an amazing deal. President Trump likes to cut deals,” Byanyima said at a media briefing in Geneva. “It could be President Trump, another Republican president, who leads the prevention revolution towards the end of AIDS.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Byanyima did note U.S. funding accounted for about 45% of the core UNAIDS budget last year and it was unlikely other donors could fill that vacuum, especially since European donors have already indicated they would cut back on their support as they redirect funds toward defense. She warned that, unless HIV efforts are restored, another 6.3 million deaths could occur as 2,000 people a day become infected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People now have to make unpopular choices, and everyone needs to reassess priorities, such as whether the Gilead drug is still a priority,” said Alan Whiteside, an AIDS researcher and a professor emeritus at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, who is now a fellow at the Balsillie School of International Affairs in Canada. “But if PEPFAR is gutted, PEPFAR cannot make good on its mission.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;John Nkengasong, who led PEPFAR from 2022 until Trump’s inauguration and had been the first director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, put it this way: lenacapavir is “a unique opportunity, a &lt;em&gt;unique &lt;/em&gt;opportunity to turn the tide in the fight against HIV/AIDS… The science has given us the tools to fight HIV, which we cannot relent. We cannot give up at the last mile.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lower back pain is a global epidemic with 619 million people suffering from this condition worldwide, according to an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanrhe/article/PIIS2665-9913(23)00133-9/fulltext" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanrhe/article/PIIS2665-9913(23)00133-9/fulltext" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet Rheumatology&lt;/em&gt; journal. And by 2050, this number is set to reach 843 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If spending prolonged periods in one position has left you feeling stiff and achy, yoga instructor &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/nicolewood.yoga/" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/nicolewood.yoga/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Nicole Wood&lt;/a&gt;, a master trainer at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.yogasix.com/" data-url="https://www.yogasix.com/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;YogaSix&lt;/a&gt;, says one move can help: standing forward fold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are many poses that offer relief for low back pain," Wood explains. "Personally, I prefer a standing forward fold because that is what feels best in my body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel that a forward fold offers a complete reset of my spine, and also helps to relax my neck and shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After a long day of sitting, and working at my desk, when I enter a forward fold, I feel relief through my backside body. I can feel the space between my vertebrae become more open."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-the-movement"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do the movement &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wood recommends completing three to five repetitions of standing forward fold and holding the stretch for 30 seconds. The instructor advises doing the move when you wake up, after you’ve finished work, and before bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can do this every day of the week," Wood explains. "There is no rule limiting how many forward folds one does, just be mindful with movement and breath."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-58XJRzaVDUXDpMv3LRscG5" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-58XJRzaVDUXDpMv3LRscG5 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repetitions:&lt;/strong&gt; 3-5 &lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 30 seconds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand in a mountain pose with your feet hip-width apart, arms by your side and your &lt;a href="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/how-to-engage-your-core" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/how-to-engage-your-core"&gt;core engaged&lt;/a&gt;. Ground down through your feet to lengthen your spine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inhale and raise your arms overhead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exhale, fold forward by hinging at the hips. Maintain a small bend your knees and lead the movement with your chest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relax your hands and head towards the ground.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Draw your navel in and up and engage your quads (front thigh muscles) and hip flexors (at the top of your legs).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Move deeper into the stretch with every breath. Inhale, find length in your spine, exhale and fold deeper.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modifications: &lt;/strong&gt;If your hands don’t reach the ground, place your hands on yoga blocks, or on your shins or hips. You may wish to bend your knees and bring your hands to your thighs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-benefits-of-doing-standing-forward-fold"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The benefits of doing standing forward fold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standing forward fold, or Uttanasana as it’s known in Sanskrit, is one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/yoga-stretches-for-beginners" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/yoga-stretches-for-beginners"&gt;best yoga poses for beginners&lt;/a&gt; for flexibility. But that’s not the only benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anytime you are folding forward in a yoga pose, there is a calming effect on the nervous system," Wood explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A standing forward fold also strengthens the thighs and knees, while stretching the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;hamstrings, calves, hips, glutes, shoulders, and soles of feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Folding forward also helps improve digestion. When the belly is folding over the thighs there&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;is gentle stimulation to the digestive system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wood says forward fold can also help the spine stay strong and supple, supporting better posture.&lt;/p&gt;
