In 2023, a US study found that cancers of all types were on the rise for younger women—but curiously not men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While for women they increased overall by more than four per cent, for young men there was a dip of almost five per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study published that year in the British Medical Journal Oncology, found that globally early-onset cancers rocketed by 79.1 per cent between 1990 and 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Breast cancer made up not just the largest number of these cases, but the largest portion of deaths from any form of cancer in under-50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 13:22:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPVFBOTWNyTlJVZGF4a3VYeHl6TGI5cGk5WXRua3FYcE1YbTJwS2UzbVpOaDUwZ01XN3p2R19SRTl1TUhRVXRnNGJXS1Zyd0dOMHZmcWZIdFdndjVnOFpMa1RDZUs1bjVqMl8wYXpsaWVic0FKSXdjZ1lRQ2NFQU5fWmU0VWs1NTN5REJaS3lpZFZ6N3MzbHN0dmxBOUhVaDdW0gGmAUFVX3lxTE5XU0FjdjFhbUIzckF6MnAxZ1FRNXBmNWJKTW9uQmc1aDRVTWFOZnY0X3h5enAyQzdpQ2IzVFhpWng1UG16UllJTmJDTzlaWkpjd0thdVBwR0RPWGxoV21RM3pQLXFha0IwOWo1WVl5R2NWX0Qwak9tRFpPNm1zR1BpcFRLNm9yb0VSZ1RwZHJ3YVZramZuT3A5S1BrcGJxUEFvQVoxT3c</guid></item><item><title>一次性电子烟比传统香烟毒性更大-每日邮报 | Disposable e-cigarettes are MORE toxic than traditional cigarettes - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxOZ0RFcWZOXzJXaE5QaTJjTkRtQzdvZ3k4eE9sM1ZrNTJyajNCRkZKcVRkWmpNU0tCa1RldmtidE9JQWZEa1RGVk5GZkQzdVdzRmo1OUY0al8wWmxCVFJOZ05NY281Rk83eUxISVZ1ZzdYQlF3SV9ENHRESWZnTFpZS1NBS3l0Vi0tQ3BWWm5hSkVxNTBlUVhyYTExdDc4QU5rczN6a0xUcFRfbmMzWmNJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vaping, long touted as 'healthier' alternatives to smoking, may actually be more toxic than traditional cigarettes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-cc523ab0-512b-11f0-b8db-d54750c05e00" class=""&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, Davis tested seven flavored e-cigarettes from three of the most popular brands and found the disposable vapes release more cancer-causing toxic metals than cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the disposable e-cigarettes studied released more lead during a day’s use than nearly 20 packs of traditional cigarettes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study's main author, Mark Salazar, a PhD candidate, said the levels were so high he 'thought our instrument was broken.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists analyzed the metals inside seven types of disposable devices from ELF Bar, Flum Pebble and Esco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using an instrument to activate the disposable e-cigarettes and heat the internal liquid, they created between 500 and 1,500 puffs for each device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After using a device to simulate the equivalent of up to a week's use, the team found they &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13361625/vaping-teens-uranium-lead-toxic-metals-brain.html"&gt;contained the heavy metals&lt;/a&gt; nickel, lead and antimony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The metals are used to make the devices' heating coils, which turns liquid in e-cigarettes into vapors that get inhaled. The metals then leach from the vapes into the liquid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A new study from the University of California - Davis found vaping may release more cancer-causing chemicals than 20 cigarettes (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows nickel, antimony and lead levels in tested vapes. The green dotted line shows the cancer risk level for lead. The purple dotted line shows this risk level for antimony, and the red dotted line represents the risk value for non-cancer diseases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vapor from three of the tested devices contained levels of lead and nickel above &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-431f3050-51c5-11f0-be71-2132733ea7a8"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; safety limits, and two had elevated levels of antimony - an element used in batteries and as a flame retardant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Esco Bars in particular were found to release four to 13 times more lead in their first 200 puffs than a pack of 20 cigarettes. This is the same amount of lead exposure as smoking 19 cigarettes in a single day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And four devices sold by Esco had levels of lead and nickel linked to respiratory and lung diseases like asthma and lung scarring.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said while they only tested three out of 100 popular vape brands, the findings show concerning health risks for teens and young adults, who are most likely to use them.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All three heavy metals tested are considered potential carcinogens, meaning they could cause cancer. And all have been associated with lung cancer, while lead has been shown to increase the risk of lung, kidney and brain cancers. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nickel has also been associated with nasal and sinus cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though vapes are higher in these heavy metals than cigarettes, decades of research suggests cigarettes are still more dangerous because they contain about 7,000 carcinogens compared to 2,000 in vapes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cigarettes have also long been proven to cause lung cancer, while research has not yet proven direct causation between vaping and the disease.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brett Poulin, senior study author and assistant professor in the UC Davis Department of Environmental Toxicology, said: 'Our study highlights the hidden risk of these new and popular disposable electronic cigarettes - with hazardous levels of neurotoxic lead and carcinogenic nickel and antimony - which stresses the need for urgency in enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These risks are not just worse than other e-cigarettes but worse in some cases than traditional cigarettes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published Wednesday in &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.5c00641"&gt;ACS Central Science&lt;/a&gt;, analyzed metal and metalloids - elements that have properties intermediate between metals and non-metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using a device to heat and activate the e-cigarettes, they made each one generate between 500 and 1,500 puffs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average vape user does about 100 to 200 puffs in a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;ELF Bar, which is also sold as EB Design (pictured here), was the most popular disposable vape of 2023 and 2024&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found vapors from three of the devices - ELF Bar Flavored, ELF Bar Clear and Esco Bar Flavored - exceeded cancer risk limits for nickel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Flum Pebble Flavored and Esco Bar Flavored exceeded these levels for antimony. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Esco Bar Flavored and Esco Bar Clear had lead emissions&lt;span&gt; that surpassed health-risk thresholds for 'non-cancer disorders.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;These include asthma and lung scarring fibrosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mark Salazar, first study author and PhD candidate in Poulin's lab, said: 'We found that these disposable devices have toxins already present in the e-liquid, or they’re leaching quite extensively from their components into e-liquids and ultimately transferred to the smoke.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graphic shows the heavy metals in different parts of the tested disposable vapes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-cc476540-512b-11f0-b8db-d54750c05e00" class=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; identified ELF as the most popular vape brand among teens and young adults in 2023 and 2024. And Esco Bars sold about $82million worth of products in the US in 2022, the latest data available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No flavored e-cigarettes are legal for sale in the US, though the FDA has authorized a limited number of unflavored ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, both varieties remain pervasive at convenience stores and through online retailers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sales data &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/illegal-us-vape-sales-worth-least-24-billion-2024-data-shows-2025-02-24/"&gt;reported by Reuters&lt;/a&gt; estimated $2.4billion worth of illegal vapes were sold in the US last year, which experts say is particularly concerning because they are not regulated or tested by any oversight agency so it's unclear what's in them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About six percent of US adults - about 17million - vape, according to the latest CDC data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And roughly six percent of middle school students and eight percent of high school students report vaping at least once in the last 30 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While they have generally been considered a safer alternative to smoking tobacco and promoted as a smoking cessation aid, recent research suggests e-cigarettes may increase the risk of heart and lung damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a case study published this month, a New Jersey man died of what's thought to be the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14821431/New-Jersey-man-worlds-documented-cancer-case-tied-habit-affects-13million.html"&gt;first documented case of lung cancer caused by e-cigarettes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It’s going to replace &lt;a href="https://www.treatmyocd.com/blog/the-three-rs-research-rumination-and-reassurance"&gt;Googling as a compulsion&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s going to be even more reinforcing than Googling, because you can ask such specific questions. And I think also people assume that ChatGPT is always correct.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;People turn to ChatGPT with all sorts of worries, from the stereotypical “How do I know if I’ve washed my hands enough?” (&lt;a href="https://www.treatmyocd.com/blog/contamination-ocd-fear-of-germs"&gt;contamination OCD&lt;/a&gt;) to the lesser-known “What if I did something immoral?” (&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-many-obsessions-that-can-haunt-a-person-with-ocd/"&gt;scrupulosity OCD&lt;/a&gt;) or “Is my fiance the love of my life or am I making a huge mistake?” (&lt;a href="https://www.treatmyocd.com/blog/relationship-ocd"&gt;relationship OCD&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Once, I was worried about my partner dying on a plane,” a writer in New York, who was diagnosed with OCD in her thirties and who asked to remain anonymous, told me. “At first, I was asking ChatGPT fairly generically, ‘What are the chances?’ And of course it said it’s very unlikely. But then I kept thinking: Okay, but is it more likely if it’s this kind of plane? What if it’s flying this kind of route?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For two hours, she pummeled ChatPGT with questions. She knew that this wasn’t actually helping her — but she kept going. “ChatGPT comes up with these answers that make you feel like you’re digging to somewhere,” she said, “even if you’re actually just stuck in the mud.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="how-chatgpt-reinforces-reassurance-seeking" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;How ChatGPT reinforces reassurance seeking &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A classic hallmark of OCD is what psychologists call “reassurance seeking.” While everyone will occasionally ask friends or loved ones for reassurance, &lt;a href="https://iocdf.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/18-Information-seekers-vs-reassurance-seekers.pdf"&gt;it’s different for people with OCD&lt;/a&gt;, who tend to ask the same question repeatedly in a quest to get uncertainty down to zero. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The goal of that behavior is to relieve anxiety or distress. After getting an answer, the distress does sometimes decrease — but it’s only temporary. Soon enough, new doubts arise and the cycle starts again, with the creeping sense that more questions must be asked in order to reach greater certainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If you ask your friend for reassurance on the same topic 50 times, they’ll probably realize that something is going on and that it might not actually be helpful for you to stay in this conversational loop. But an AI chatbot is happy to keep answering all your questions, and then the doubts you have about its answers, and then the doubts you have about its answers to your doubts, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In other words, ChatGPT will naively play along with reassurance-seeking behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“That actually just makes the OCD worse. It becomes that much harder to resist doing it again,” Levine said. Instead of continuing to compulsively seek definitive answers, the clinical consensus is that people with OCD need to accept that sometimes we can’t get rid of uncertainty — we just have to sit with it and learn to tolerate it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The “gold standard” treatment for OCD is exposure and response prevention (ERP), in which people are exposed to the troubling questions that obsess them and then resist the urge to engage in a compulsion like reassurance-seeking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Levine, who pioneered the use of &lt;a href="https://iocdf.org/expert-opinions/how-do-i-stop-thinking-about-this-what-to-do-when-youre-stuck-playing-mental-ping-pong/"&gt;non-engagement responses&lt;/a&gt; — statements that affirm the presence of anxiety rather than trying to escape it through compulsions — noted that there’s another way in which an AI chatbot is more tempting than Googling for answers, as many OCD sufferers do. Whereas the search engine just links you to a variety of websites, state-of-the-art AI systems promise to help you analyze and &lt;a href="/future-perfect/400531/ai-reasoning-models-openai-deepseek"&gt;reason through a complex problem&lt;/a&gt;. That is extremely enticing — “OCD loves that!” Levine said — but for someone suffering from the disorder, it can too easily become a lengthy exercise in co-rumination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="reasoning-machine-or-rumination-machine" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Reasoning machine or rumination machine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;According to one evidence-based approach to treating OCD, called &lt;a href="https://iocdf.org/ocd-treatment-guide/i-cbt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;inference-based cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; (I-CBT), people with OCD are prone to a faulty reasoning pattern that draws on a mix of personal experiences, rules, hearsay, facts, and possibilities. That gives rise to obsessive doubts and tricks them into feeling like they need to listen to those doubts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Joseph Harwerth, an OCD and anxiety specialist, offers an illustration of how trying to reason with the help of an AI chatbot can actually further confuse the “obsessional reasoning” of people with OCD. Considering what you might do if you have a cut on your finger and struggle with contamination OCD — where people fear becoming sullied or sullying others with germs, dirt, or other contaminants — &lt;a href="https://wetreatocd.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-ocd"&gt;he writes&lt;/a&gt;, “You wonder: Can I get tetanus from touching a doorknob? You may go to ChatGPT to investigate the validity of that doubt.” Here’s how he imagines the conversation going: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="duet--article--blockquote _1c7w9tz0 xkp0cg9"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1c7w9tz8 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q1:&lt;/strong&gt; Should you wash your hands if they feel dirty?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1c7w9tz8 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A1:&lt;/strong&gt; “Yes, you should wash your hands if they feel dirty. That sensation usually means there is something on your skin, like dirt, oil, sweat, or germs, that you will want to remove.” (When asked for its reasoning, ChatGPT said it based its answer on sources from the CDC and WHO.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1c7w9tz8 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q2:&lt;/strong&gt; Can I get tetanus from a doorknob?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1c7w9tz8 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A2:&lt;/strong&gt; “It is extremely unlikely to get tetanus from a doorknob, unless you have an open wound and somehow rubbed soil or contaminated material into it via the doorknob.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1c7w9tz8 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q3:&lt;/strong&gt; Can people have tetanus without realizing it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1c7w9tz8 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A3:&lt;/strong&gt; “It is rare, but in the very early stages, some people might not immediately realize they have tetanus, especially if the wound seemed minor or was overlooked.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="duet--article--blockquote _1c7w9tz0 xkp0cg9"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1c7w9tz8 xkp0cg1"&gt;Then, your OCD creates this story: &lt;em&gt;I feel dirty when I touch doorknobs (personal experience). It is&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;recommended by the CDC to wash your hands if you feel dirty (rules). I read online that people can get tetanus from touching a doorknob (hearsay). Germs can spread through contact (general facts). It is possible that someone touched my door without knowing they had tetanus and then spread it on my doorknob (possibility).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In this scenario, the chatbot enables the user to construct a narrative that justifies their obsessional fear. It doesn’t guide the user away from obsessional reasoning — it just provides fodder for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Part of the problem, Harwerth says, is that a chatbot doesn’t have enough context about each user, unless the user thinks to provide it, so it doesn’t know when someone has OCD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“ChatGPT can fall into the same trap that non-OCD specialists fall into,” Harwerth told me. “The trap is: Oh, let’s have a conversation about your thoughts. What could have led you to have these thoughts? What does this mean about you?” While that might be a helpful approach for a client who doesn’t have OCD, it can backfire when a psychologist engages in that kind of therapy with someone suffering from OCD, because it encourages them to keep ruminating on the topic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What’s more, because chatbots can be sycophants, they may just validate whatever the user says instead of challenging it. A chatbot that’s overly flattering and supportive of a user’s thoughts — &lt;a href="/future-perfect/411318/openai-chatgpt-4o-artificial-intelligence-sam-altman-chatbot-personality"&gt;like ChatGPT was for a time&lt;/a&gt; — can be dangerous for people with mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="whose-job-is-it-to-prevent-the-compulsive-use-of-chatgpt" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Whose job is it to prevent the compulsive use of ChatGPT?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If using a chatbot can exacerbate OCD symptoms, is it the responsibility of the company behind the chatbot to protect vulnerable users? Or is it the users’ responsibility to learn how not to use ChatGPT, just as they’ve had to learn not to use Google or WebMD for reassurance-seeking?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“I think it’s on both,” Harwerth told me. “We cannot perfectly curate the world to people with OCD — they have to understand their own condition and how that leaves them vulnerable to misusing applications. In the same breath, I would say that when people explicitly ask the AI model to behave as a trained therapist” — which some users with mental health conditions do — “I do think it’s important for the model to say, ‘I’m pulling this from these sources. However, I’m not a trained therapist.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Levine, for her part, agreed that the burden can’t rest solely on the companies. “It wouldn’t be fair to make it their responsibility, just like it wouldn’t be fair to make Google responsible for all the compulsive Googling. But it would be great if even just a warning could come up, like, ‘This seems perhaps compulsive.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, acknowledged in &lt;a href="https://cdn.openai.com/papers/15987609-5f71-433c-9972-e91131f399a1/openai-affective-use-study.pdf"&gt;a recent paper&lt;/a&gt; that the chatbot can foster problematic behavior patterns. “We observe a trend that longer usage is associated with lower socialization, more emotional dependence and more problematic use,” the study finds, defining the latter as “indicators of addiction to ChatGPT usage, including preoccupation, withdrawal symptoms, loss of control, and mood modification” as well as “indicators of potentially compulsive or unhealthy interaction patterns.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“We know that ChatGPT can feel more responsive and personal than prior technologies, especially for vulnerable individuals, and that means the stakes are higher,” an OpenAI spokesperson told me in an email. “We’re working to better understand and reduce ways ChatGPT might unintentionally reinforce or amplify existing, negative behavior…We’re doing this so we can continue refining how our models identify and respond appropriately in sensitive conversations, and we’ll continue updating the behavior of our models based on what we learn.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;(Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that have signed partnership agreements with OpenAI.

But if a chatbot is essentially diagnosing a user, that raises serious privacy concerns. Chatbots aren’t bound by the same rules as professional therapists when it comes to safeguarding people’s sensitive health information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The writer in New York who has OCD told me she would find it helpful if the chatbot would challenge the frame of the conversation. “It could say, ‘I notice that you’ve asked many detailed iterations of this question, but sometimes more detailed information doesn’t bring you closer. Would you like to take a walk?’” she said. “Maybe wording it like that can interrupt the loop, without insinuating that someone has a mental illness, whether they do or not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While there’s some &lt;a href="https://medicine.stanford.edu/news/current-news/standard-news/AI-ocd-diagnosis.html"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that AI could correctly identify OCD, it’s not clear how it could pick up on compulsive behaviors without covertly or overtly classifying the user as having OCD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“This is not me saying that OpenAI is responsible for making sure I don’t do this,” the writer added. “But I do think there are ways to make it easier for me to help myself.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxORW9zN2RzQU1MbHRoaVg1VkJKX2FRWjRVU041RFNVTEY4T3dwZTZtTFpiNXZSNXJRMnlDRDVVcUNhcE56Q0pialVjTnVkdDJSVnE5RHgyWGZHaWxJaXJrdTdyZEZHR1FtaWh0aTZ5MGJ3VWNkc3V3Rmg3VEFBWGRTQnpiRlJrckM4czZFNXE0MXlrRDNObV9YaWJsQQ</guid></item><item><title>一次性电子烟比传统香烟更有毒-加州大学戴维斯分校 | Disposable E-Cigarettes More Toxic Than Traditional Cigarettes - UC Davis</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxNcEdvU084S0dDNENJUW1tTFp4aXdqNHU2d1YwSm5PZFg3bmJlUzZoRlhYaUJtdzhGVlllaEhvdWR1bTdTZU5zV3hydTNZUThnWEt1emtxQ2tvQS0wNDJ0Qlgwai1qaUVTVk5qZlZuMExITDRLdXNPN1RxX1RwMXcxb3ctQ3JRMVZZbVkzRVExWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dropcap clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They may look like travel shampoo bottles and smell like bubblegum, but after a few hundred puffs, some disposable, electronic cigarettes and vape pods release higher amounts of toxic metals than older e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes, according to a study from the University of California, Davis. For example, one of the disposable e-cigarettes studied released more lead during a day’s use than nearly 20 packs of traditional cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.5c00641"&gt;The study, published today&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;ACS Central Science&lt;/em&gt;, noted that although most disposable e-cigarettes are illegal in the United States, they remain widely available. Most consumers of disposable e-cigarettes are teens or young adults, who are also highly susceptible to lead exposure. &lt;span&gt;Inhaling certain metals can increase a person’s risk of cancer, respiratory disease and nerve damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Our study highlights the hidden risk of these new and popular disposable electronic cigarettes — with hazardous levels of neurotoxic lead and carcinogenic nickel and antimony — which stresses the need for urgency in enforcement,” said senior author Brett Poulin, an assistant professor in the UC Davis Department of Environmental Toxicology. “T&lt;/span&gt;hese risks are not just worse than other e-cigarettes but worse in some cases than traditional cigarettes.”&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="caption caption-drupal-media"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘What are you smoking?’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First author Mark Salazar, a Ph.D. candidate in Poulin’s lab, first saw a disposable vape pod when he was visiting a friend. The pods are self-contained cartridges that hold a battery, e-liquid and heating coil. Salazar was curious: What, exactly, was his friend smoking? He brought the pod back to the lab at UC Davis and tested its vapor for metal concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I first saw the lead concentrations, they were so high I thought our instrument was broken,” Salazar said. “That sparked us into looking further into these disposables.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When I first saw the lead concentrations, they were so high I thought our instrument was broken.” —Mark Salazar, UC Davis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The scientists analyzed the metal and metalloids inside seven types of disposable devices from three of the most popular brands. Using an instrument to activate the disposable e-cigarettes and heat the internal liquid, they created between 500 and 1,500 puffs for each device. They found:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list--arrow"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some devices emitted surprisingly high concentrations of elements in the vapor, including antimony and lead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Levels of chromium, nickel and antimony increased as the number of puffs increased.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most of the disposable e-cigarettes tested released markedly higher amounts of metals and metalloids into vapors than earlier, refillable vapes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists then took apart the devices to trace the sources of the metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that these disposable devices have toxins already present in the e-liquid, or they’re leaching quite extensively from their components into e-liquids and ultimately transferred to the smoke,” Salazar said.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaded bronze alloy components in some devices leached nickel and lead to the e-liquid. Nickel was also released from heating coils, and antimony was present in unused e-liquids at high levels, both of which increase the risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="caption caption-drupal-media"&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understudied health risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers also assessed the health risk for daily users. Vapors from three of the devices had nickel levels and two devices had antimony levels that exceeded cancer risk limits. Vapors from four of the devices had nickel and lead emissions that surpassed health-risk thresholds for illnesses besides cancer, such as neurological damage and respiratory diseases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the researchers tested only three of the nearly 100 disposable e-cigarette brands on the market, they say this initial work prompts concern given the popularity of disposable e-cigarettes, especially among adolescents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The market is also outpacing science. Few studies of the relatively new devices are available, leaving consumers and regulators largely uninformed. The work underscores the need to enforce regulations around illegal e-cigarettes while continuing research to reveal the extent of the problem and its public health implications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s co-authors include Lalima Saini, Tran Nguyen, Kent Pinkerton, Amy Madi and Austin Cole of UC Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was supported with funding from &lt;span&gt;the UC Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences T32 training program, and the University of California Agricultural Experiment Station.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt; is a 200-year-old peer-reviewed weekly medical journal from the United Kingdom. Since its launch, the journal has expanded into a family of more than 20 speciality journals and has set up several global Lancet Commissions on various important issues in medicine and healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a press release issued a day ago, the journal said that since its inception in 1974, the World Health Organisation’s Essential Programme on Immunisation (EPI) achieved “unprecedented progress”, averting the deaths of an estimated 154 million children worldwide through routine childhood vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it said that as per a major new analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study Vaccine Coverage Collaborators, “Despite the progress of the past 50 years, the last two decades have also been marked by stagnating childhood vaccination rates and wide variation in vaccine coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These challenges have been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving millions of children vulnerable to preventable diseases and death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the study, titled: “Global, regional, and national trends in routine childhood vaccination coverage from 1980 to 2023 with forecasts to 2030: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023”, said that the latest estimates should be taken as a “clear warning” that global immunisation targets for 2030 would not be achieved without “transformational improvements in equity”, according to the press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, the WHO set ambitious goals for improving vaccine coverage globally through the &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1668378"&gt;Immunisation Agenda 2030&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to data from 2023, which the analysis is based upon, more than half of the world’s 15.7 million unvaccinated children were living in just eight countries, with 53 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa and 13pc in South Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Despite the monumental efforts of the past 50 years, progress has been far from universal. Large numbers of children remain under and un-vaccinated,” senior study author Dr Jonathan Mosser from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journal pointed out that the Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated challenges with global coverage rates of the original EPI-recommended vaccines declining sharply beginning in 2020, resulting in an estimated 15.6m children missing the full three doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine or a measles vaccine between 2020 and 2023, as well as 15.9m children not receiving any polio vaccine and 9.18m missing out on the tuberculosis vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Covid-19 pandemic also reversed previous gains in reducing the number of unvaccinated zero-dose children globally, which peaked at 18.6m before falling to 15.7m by 2023. The study estimates that disruptions to immunisation services during the Covid pandemic resulted in around 12.8m additional unvaccinated zero-dose children globally during the four pandemic years (2020-2023).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It stressed that “accelerated progress” would be necessary to achieve the 2030 target of halving the number of zero-dose children compared to 2019 levels, with only 18 of 204 countries and territories estimated to have already met this target as of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It added that population pressures would also add a “double burden to already overstretched healthcare systems that are ill-equipped to handle the substantial growth in vaccine target populations”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors called for more concerted efforts to tackle vaccine misinformation and hesitancy to increase vaccine acceptance and uptake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="pakistans-situation" href="#pakistans-situation" class="heading-permalink" aria-hidden="true" title="Permalink"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Pakistan’s situation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also found that Pakistan had the highest number of children with zero doses of vaccines after India in South Asia, with 419,000 children falling into that category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Increasing numbers of wild-type polio cases have been reported in Pakistan and Afghanistan,” the press release stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the Pakistan Polio Programme &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1913239"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; the third drive of the year against the crippling disease at the National Emergency Operations Centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wayne County Health Department announced Monday that Illinois’ first human case of West Nile Virus (WNV) in 2025 has been confirmed in a Wayne County resident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the individual was hospitalized due to complications from the virus but has since been discharged and is recovering at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected Culex mosquito, which contracts the virus by feeding on infected birds. Most individuals show no symptoms, but those who do may experience fever, nausea, headaches, and muscle aches lasting days or weeks. In rare instances, WNV can cause severe neurological conditions such as meningitis, encephalitis, paralysis, or even death. The elderly and individuals with weakened immune systems are at highest risk for serious illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far in 2025, 19 counties in Illinois have reported WNV activity through positive mosquito, horse, or human cases. These include: Bureau, Christian, Clinton, Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Fulton, Grundy, Hancock, Henry, Marshall, McDonough, McHenry, Peoria, Scott, Stark, Tazewell, Wayne, and Winnebago. In 2024, the state recorded 69 human cases of WNV, including 13 deaths, the most since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that we are seeing the first human case of West Nile virus so early in the season serves as a timely reminder—especially for seniors and those with weakened immune systems—to protect yourself from illnesses caused by mosquito bites,” said IDPH Director Dr. Sameer Vohra. “I encourage all Illinoisans to ‘Fight the Bite’ and take precautions to protect themselves and their loved ones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDPH Offers the Public Three Key Prevention Steps: Reduce, Repel, and Report&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REDUCE exposure by avoiding the outdoors during peak mosquito activity (dusk to dawn), fixing damaged screens, and eliminating standing water around homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REPEL mosquitoes using EPA-registered insect repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535. Wear long sleeves and pants when outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REPORT potential mosquito breeding sites such as stagnant water in ditches, containers, or flooded yards to local municipal authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) is providing $2.8 million in funding to local health departments across the state to support mosquito control efforts, including larvicide application, vector surveillance, and public education campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information about West Nile virus, visit the Illinois Department of Public Health’s website at:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;📍 www.idph.state.il.us/envhealth/wnv.htm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The Romans &lt;a href="https://historyandarchaeologyonline.com/how-did-the-romans-manage-pregnancy/"&gt;hypothesized&lt;/a&gt; (wrongly) that boys caused more nausea in their mothers and advised women to fast for one day and take a hot wine bath to combat symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;By the 1960s, doctors were prescribing seemingly more effective drugs to combat the barfing. When one such drug, thalidomide, &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/newsroom/news-releases/2018/after-60-years-scientists-uncover-how-thalidomide-produced-birth-defects"&gt;turned out&lt;/a&gt; to cause birth defects in the children born to parents who’d taken it, however, the scandal caused a chilling effect on the study of pregnancy nausea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But the story of how we finally got a scientific answer to why some pregnant people get sicker than others starts with a woman in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;After geneticist Marlena Fejzo experienced a debilitating form of pregnancy nausea, called &lt;a href="https://americanpregnancy.org/healthy-pregnancy/pregnancy-complications/hyperemesis-gravidarum"&gt;hyperemesis gravidarum&lt;/a&gt;, she found very little in the scientific literature attempting to explain why. Then an early career post-doc, Fejzo decided she would set out to find the answer herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Pregnancy nausea was not Fejzo’s professional focus at the time she set out to study it, and she didn’t have funding to embark on any formal research, so she embarked on a bit of a DIY inquiry. She posted a survey online in the early days of the internet and received hundreds of replies via fax from people who’d experienced hyperemesis. Those gave her the first clues that the mechanism at play might be genetic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;On the latest episode of the &lt;em&gt;Unexplainable&lt;/em&gt; podcast, I talk to Dr. Fejzo about her pregnancy and her path to finding a biological &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06921-9"&gt;cause&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40173258/"&gt;cure&lt;/a&gt; to pregnancy nausea.

However, overall heart disease death rates over the past five decades dropped by 66% in American adults age 25 and older, according to a new study. Even better, deaths from heart attacks dropped by nearly 90%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Over the past 50 years, our understanding of heart disease, what causes it and how we treat it has evolved considerably,” said lead study author Dr. Sara King, a second-year internal medicine resident at Stanford University School of Medicine in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There have been great strides made in helping people survive initial acute cardiac events that were once considered a death sentence,” King said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unfortunately, that positive news has a flip side. Deaths from all other types of heart disease, including &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:arrhythmia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;arrhythmia&lt;/a&gt;, heart failure and hypertensive heart disease increased by 81% in the United States, according to the study &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.038644" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:published Wednesday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;published Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s important to put both sets of numbers into perspective, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“These days, the likelihood of dying from a heart attack is relatively low compared to where it’s been, but the likelihood of significant disability from the heart attack is still high,” said Freeman, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“You might develop heart failure — where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs and you’re always short of breath,” he said. “Or maybe you’re on a number of medications for blood pressure, fluid retention and cholesterol, or you never feel your best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s one thing to be alive, it’s another to be alive and well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Cardiovascular risks on the rise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study analyzed government data on deaths from heart disease between 1970 and 2022. Back in 1970, heart attacks were responsible for 54% of all deaths from heart issues. By 2022 that number had dropped to 29%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Deaths from atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias, which happen when electrical impulses to the heart go awry and cause an irregular heartbeat or “flutter” in the chest, were rare in the 1970s. By 2022, the number had risen to 450% — about 4% of all heart disease deaths, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Deaths from heart failure increased 146% over the same time period, while death due to persistent high blood pressure rose by 106%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Changes in cardiovascular risk factors are contributing to the rise in certain types of heart disease, the study said. Obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, poor food choices and physical inactivity have skyrocketed over the past 50 years. Obesity prevalence rose from 15% in 1970 to 40% in 2022, the study found. Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes now impacts nearly half of all adults in the United States. High blood pressure increased from 30% in 1978 to nearly 50% in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another potential contributor — the aging Baby Boomer population now reaching a time when they are most likely to develop heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“All of these risk factors contribute to an ongoing burden of heart disease, especially as related to heart failure, hypertensive heart disease and arrhythmias,” said senior study author Dr. Latha Palaniappan, professor of cardiovascular medicine and associate dean for research at Stanford University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Heart disease hasn’t gone away,” Palaniappan said in a statement. “The focus now must be on helping people age with strong, healthy hearts by preventing events, and prevention can start as early as childhood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The US was the biggest funder of global HIV initiatives until the start of Donald Trump's second term as president&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Experts told DW cuts to domestic health institutions and foreign aid are likely to jeopardize efforts to stop an increase in HIV infections&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;They said the risk was real despite lencapavir, a highly promising, preventative drug that's now approved in the US for HIV prevention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battle against HIV has been dealt repeated blows in 2025 with cuts to funding for &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/us-officially-cancelling-83-of-usaid-programs-rubio-says/a-71879861"&gt;major global aid programs&lt;/a&gt; by the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have also been budget cuts closer to home. And experts have told DW the cuts risk undermining efforts to end the HIV epidemic in the US by 2030, even now, with the approval of lenacapavir — what UNAIDS officials have described as a "miracle" drug — in HIV prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lencapavir provides six months of protection against &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/hiv-aids/t-18932088"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; infection. The renowned journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; named it 2024's scientific "breakthrough of the year."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some experts are asking whether the promise of the drug could be undone by the defunding of US public health agencies that are vital for getting lencapavir to those who need it most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Are we going to squander this, probably the greatest opportunity in 44 years of HIV prevention both in the US and globally?" asked Mitchell Warren, executive director of the nonpartisan HIV organization AVAC, in an interview with DW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What makes lenacapavir a 'miracle' drug?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAIDS, the United Nations agency that addresses HIV and AIDS around the world, dubbed lenacapavir a "miracle product" in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it was hype, it was well-founded hype. In late-stage clinical trials, lenacapavir had a near-perfect record of suppressing HIV infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having already approved it as a treatment to reduce viral load in patients with the disease, the US Food and Drug Administration has now confirmed lenacapavir as a &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/5-things-to-know-about-the-hiv-prevention-drug-prep/a-47384491"&gt;pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) drug&lt;/a&gt;. PrEP drugs are taken before having &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/sexually-transmitted-infections-stis/t-64645822"&gt;unprotected sex&lt;/a&gt; or injecting drugs to protect against HIV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike other PrEP drugs, which aim to disrupt the virus at one stage of its life cycle, lencapavir has been shown to attack HIV at several stages, increasing its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 400,000 US patients use some form of PrEP, usually a daily pill. But a twice-a-year injection with lenacapavir would provide people with the longest-lasting protection yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;'Knock-on effects are huge'&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his first term, US President &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/donald-trump/t-19434433"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; started an "Ending the HIV Epidemic" (EHE) initiative, an effort to stop the transmission of the disease within the US by the end of this decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the current Trump administration's cost-cutting drive has downsized the federal health budget, affecting key public health agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and programs including Medicare and Medicaid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America's global aid initiatives, including USAID and PEPFAR (the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief), have also been substantially wound back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Whether it's the NIH research infrastructure [or] USAID for foreign assistance, these are big programs and none of them are HIV specific," Warren said. "But each one of them is diminished now in [its ability] to deliver the comprehensive and integrated programs that have been really at the forefront [of HIV response]."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of this lost funding, Warren said, is that especially vulnerable groups, such as those from low-income backgrounds, gay and bisexual men and sex workers, may not benefit from the new PrEP drug, lenacapavir, which could provide them with unprecedented protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Crowley, director of the Center for HIV and Infectious Disease Policy at the O'Neill Institute in Washington, said services like expanded Medicaid coverage have meant better access to HIV programs for those with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is an incredible accomplishment, and it's helped drive a lot of the progress we've seen," Crowley told DW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also said the cuts will mean people lose access to HIV services, which other programs can't cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I think the American people can be proud of how we responded to the HIV crisis domestically and globally, but this is all at risk. We've come so far, after so much death, why would we take a step backward?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Global impact to be felt soon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year, more than a million new HIV cases are reported globally and, until recently, US support through programs like USAID and PEPFAR was essential in helping regions most affected by the disease, &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/south-africa-usaid-cuts-could-prompt-over-500000-hiv-deaths/a-71777420"&gt;especially countries in Africa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the Trump administration's aid withdrawal has already had an impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data from UNAIDS suggests there will be 2,300 more HIV cases per year because of the cuts to PEPFAR alone. Annual infections to date were already at about 3,500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Less funding means we will get more and more off track," said Byanyima in mid-June. "We don't know what the total impact [of the US cuts] will be, but impact there will be. Already, you see in several countries a drop in the number of people going to clinics."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US government continues to support pregnant women and new mothers via PEPFAR, but the changes have stopped access to PrEP for gay and bisexual men, sex workers and drug users — groups that are disproportionately affected by HIV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warren said it was akin to "throwing out a whole generation" of progress.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;1. Keep a pain diary&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thoughts that trigger or increase back pain vary by person, as do the emotions they provoke. Research suggests that ruminating on your back pain – thinking about it over and over again – can make it feel &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10069845/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;both more intense and more life-limiting&lt;/a&gt;. Writing them down can help process that and put an end to rumination.“Try jotting down the negative thoughts you have and getting into a conversation with them, about what you can do to better look after yourself in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;2. Work on accepting that back pain is part of your life for now&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the worst elements of back pain is its continuous presence in our lives, no matter what we do. It’s normal to feel anxious, down or angry because of it. &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/stress/what-stress-does-body-how-avoid-sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Depression and anxiety can both cause a predisposition to and worsen back pain&lt;/a&gt;. “Research shows that in men, anger is closely related to back pain. Struggling to manage anger can both cause and worsen pain because it leads to increased muscle tension, but of course, the pain makes many men angrier too,” says Martinelli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to reduce the pain you suffer, it’s important to accept the position you’re in, says Martinelli, however bad it may be. “Notice the struggle and name it,” says Martinelli. “When you feel yourself fighting the pain, say “this is me struggling”. That small act of awareness can shift how you respond.” It can also be helpful to use metaphors to change the relationship that you have with the pain (see the three specific suggestions from Martinelli below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things may well change for the better in the future, “but in the moment, it’s important to accept how you feel and not try to change it or run away from it. This only makes the pain worse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;3. Getting outside can be a powerful distraction&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Don’t underestimate the power of connecting with nature,” says Martinelli. It might sound woo-woo but there’s science to support the proposition that &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/why-princess-of-wales-using-great-outdoors-to-heal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the great outdoors can boost wellbeing&lt;/a&gt; and bring you into the present, distracting you from worries about the future and reducing pain. &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10538778/#:~:text=The%20literature%20suggests%20that%20the,the%20management%20of%20chronic%20pain." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Multiple studies&lt;/a&gt; have demonstrated that exposure to green space reduces pain and improves quality of life in people suffering with chronic pain conditions, including back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even watching nature scenes on a screen can relieve pain, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://news.exeter.ac.uk/faculty-of-health-and-life-sciences/watching-nature-scenes-can-reduce-pain-new-study-shows/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;research suggests.&lt;/a&gt; A recent neuroimaging study from the University of Vienna and the University of Exeter, showed that nature helps because “the brain is reacting less to information about where the pain is coming from and how intense it feels”, said Max Steininger, who led the study. “So try to make five minutes to get out for a quick walk around the park when you can,” says Martinelli. “Over time, doing this regularly will help to reduce the pain you feel in your everyday life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;4. Pay attention to when you’re worrying about the pain – and stretch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When pain arises, we often respond by turning on a mental “struggle switch” – resisting, fighting or trying to push the pain away. This response tends to make things worse by layering frustration, fear and tension on top of the pain. When we learn to notice this instinct and gently turn the switch off, the pain might still be present, but we’re no longer adding emotional suffering to it. This shift makes space for calm, choice and greater self-compassion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back pain is “a signal from the body that something has gone wrong in how we’re treating it”, says Martinelli. Those of us who work at desks are used to hearing that we should get up and stretch every half an hour, and go for a quick walk every hour or so, but few of us actually do. Part of the work of mindfulness and CBT is to show patients &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/bones-joints/daily-habits-how-to-get-rid-of-back-pain-treat-prevent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;how important it is to take a minute for this kind of self-care&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is best practised when you have negative thoughts about your pain and the future, Martinelli says. Instead of becoming distracted by them, “take that time to stretch, as when you’re having negative thoughts, your body tenses up, and having a quick stretch will relieve that and get your mind back into the present moment”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;5. Schedule deep breathing into your day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s easier than you might think to practice mindfulness and feel the benefits: just five minutes of &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/stress/how-to-breathe-anxiety-technique/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;deep breathing&lt;/a&gt;, practised three times a day, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.ons.org/publications-research/cjon/25/2/mindful-breathing-effects-five-minute-practice-perceived-stress-and" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;can be enough to relieve pain&lt;/a&gt;. Combining this with having your morning coffee or tea can be a great way to build the habit, says Martinelli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Start your day with a hot drink and pay attention to all the things you like about it and how calm you feel before your day starts up,” Martinelli recommends. “This sets a positive intention for the day and gives you space from negative thoughts that might be aggravating your pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How to use CBT to break out of negative thought patterns and relieve pain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mabel Martinelli&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People living with chronic back pain often develop certain beliefs or thought patterns about their pain – for instance, that it will inevitably get worse and continue to limit what they can do. These thoughts can become automatic and powerful, increasing distress and making the pain feel worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s where CBT comes in: it helps people to notice these thoughts, challenge unhelpful patterns, and develop more flexible ways of thinking. There are three metaphors I use often to help people relate to their pain in a new way:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Think about pain as quicksand: the more we struggle against it, the more stuck we feel. But when we stop fighting, we can find ways to float.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Imagine the ocean and the surfer: pain is like the waves – we can’t stop them, but we can learn to surf.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;See pain as a heavy backpack: pain is a burden, but carrying it while still walking toward what matters is possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you regularly experience pain or recurring injuries in the hips or knees, even though you stretch and do strength training, you may feel like throwing in the towel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But according to physical therapist Sanjit Kooner, there’s one set of muscles people with injuries in these areas of the body often neglect. They’re known as the hip stabilizers, which play an important role in proper hip movement and stability. If these muscles aren’t functioning well, it can have a trickle-down effect on your knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kooner has shared his favourite exercise for strengthening these muscles to help prevent hip and knee injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a deceptively simple yet highly effective glute and hip stabilizer drill,” he tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I first learned this drill from a sport physiotherapy specialist, and I was skeptical until I felt how effectively it targeted the stabilizers we often miss in traditional training.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-the-hip-and-knee-stability-drill"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do the hip and knee stability drill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Kooner demonstrates the move with a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=110083&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Ffoam-roller-exercise-roller%2Fb%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D3407871%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dfitandwell-gb-1174522568072241681-20" data-url="https://www.amazon.com/foam-roller-exercise-roller/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=3407871" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=110083&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Ffoam-roller-exercise-roller%2Fb%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D3407871%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id="1471" data-merchant-network="Amazonus" data-merchant-url="amazon.com"&gt;foam roller&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=110083&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Frh%3Dn%253A17388462011%26language%3Den_US%26brr%3D1%26rd%3D1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dfitandwell-gb-9913253755448986805-20" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.amazon.com/s?rh=n%3A17388462011&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;brr=1&amp;amp;rd=1" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=110083&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Frh%3Dn%253A17388462011%26language%3Den_US%26brr%3D1%26rd%3D1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id="1471" data-merchant-network="Amazonus" data-merchant-url="amazon.com"&gt;Pilates ball&lt;/a&gt; or even a small sports ball is preferable. “I recommend doing it with a small ball against the wall rather than a foam roller for better control and feedback,” says Kooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although you may pay more attention to your leg pressing against the foam roller or ball because it’s an unfamiliar position, it’s your standing leg that will be doing most of the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-np7Eo8C85UbXchBhgQH8Bk" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-np7Eo8C85UbXchBhgQH8Bk slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike with traditional single-leg squats, you don’t necessarily need a full range of motion here. “You don’t need to squat deep to get the benefits,” says Kooner. “In fact, partial range squats are often more relevant and functional in athletic settings. The goal is to maintain control, tension and alignment rather than chase depth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kooner recommends completing two sets of 10 to 12 reps on each leg, aiming to do this two to three times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-benefits-of-this-drill"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The benefits of this drill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’ll feel a deep burn through the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Gluteus_Medius" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Gluteus_Medius" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;gluteus medius&lt;/a&gt; and other hip stabilizers, which are crucial for balance, injury prevention and efficient movement in sport,” says Kooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This move will also help you improve balance and coordination, so you can move well in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;

The disease is rare and thought to only affect those with compromised immunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, a combination of Covid infection, poorly-managed diabetes and an over-use of steroids to control lung inflammation from Covid led to a spike in infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In 2021, there was an epidemic in India, with 40,000 cases leading to 3,500 deaths.

			&lt;p&gt;Imagine itching, burning, swelling, or even struggling to breathe just moments after sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a small but growing number of women, that's not an awkward anecdote – it's a medical condition. It's called seminal plasma hypersensitivity (SPH) – an allergy to semen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This rare but underdiagnosed allergy isn't triggered by sperm cells, but by proteins in the seminal plasma – the fluid that carries sperm. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1409127/"&gt;First documented in 1967&lt;/a&gt;, when a woman was hospitalised after a "violent allergic reaction" to sex, SPH is now recognised as a &lt;a href="https://karger.com/books/book/2513/chapter-abstract/5740303/IgE-Mediated-Allergy-against-Human-Seminal-Plasma?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;type 1 hypersensitivity&lt;/a&gt;, the same category as hay  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fever" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73066" data-postid="165723" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt;, peanut allergy, and cat dander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms range from mild to severe. Some women experience local reactions: burning, itching, redness, and swelling of the vulva or vagina. Others develop full-body symptoms: hives, wheezing, dizziness, runny nose and even anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_165730" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165730" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/anaphylaxis_semen_allergy_642.jpg" alt="person struggling to breathe" class="wp-image-165730 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/anaphylaxis_semen_allergy_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/anaphylaxis_semen_allergy_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/anaphylaxis_semen_allergy_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-165730" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Some allergic reactions can involve the whole body. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAD6gcnx9cg/"&gt;Maridav/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until 1997, SPH was thought to affect fewer than 100 women globally. But &lt;a href="https://www.annallergy.org/article/S1081-1206(10)63372-8/abstract"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; led by allergist Jonathan Bernstein found that among women reporting postcoital symptoms, nearly 12% could be classified as having probable SPH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sexual-competition-may-actually-boost-mens-semen-quality?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Sexual Competition May Actually Boost Men's Semen Quality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I conducted a &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2339588/Up-12-women-allergic-semen-claims-leading-expert--wrongly-blaming-symptoms-STDs.html"&gt;small, unpublished survey in 2013&lt;/a&gt; and found a similar 12% rate. The true figure may be higher still. Many cases go unreported, misdiagnosed, or dismissed as STIs, yeast infections, or general "sensitivity". One revealing clue: symptoms disappear when condoms are used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/aji.13865"&gt;A 2024 study&lt;/a&gt; reinforced this finding, suggesting that SPH is both more common and more commonly misdiagnosed than previously believed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The problem isn't the sperm&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main allergen appears to be prostate-specific antigen (PSA): a protein found in all seminal plasma, not just that of a particular partner. In other words, women can develop a reaction to any man's semen, not just their regular partner's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also &lt;a href="https://karger.com/iaa/article-abstract/159/2/143/166337/Involvement-of-Can-f-5-in-a-Case-of-Human-Seminal?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;evidence of cross-reactivity&lt;/a&gt;. For example, Can f 5, a protein found in dog dander, is structurally similar to human PSA. So women allergic to dogs may find themselves reacting to semen too. &lt;a href="https://www.jiaci.org/summary/vol17-issue3-num224"&gt;In one unusual case&lt;/a&gt;, a woman with a Brazil nut allergy broke out in hives after sex, probably due to trace nut proteins in her partner's semen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis begins with a detailed sexual and medical history, often followed by &lt;a href="https://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/630783/1/The%20Andrologist.%208.%202-3.%202012.pdf"&gt;skin prick testing&lt;/a&gt; with the partner's semen or blood tests for PSA-specific  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="165723" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt; (IgE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my own research involving symptomatic women, we demonstrated that &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/14647273.2013.800238"&gt;testing with washed spermatozoa&lt;/a&gt;, free from seminal plasma, can help confirm that the allergic trigger is not the sperm cells themselves, but proteins in the seminal fluid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it's not just women. It's possible some men may be allergic to their own semen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This condition, known as &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41443-024-00860-3.epdf?sharing_token=I2FR3u9BliHMlozsquOtk9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PvbCzZN8pN21oCljinYmTHcw0edw-BJgVxZ4CYw6kdSsbC_wdOVK52rd-ZFl5Mo7Bu8VYZUEQLUCdh6w-Vllg4-YUrnH4eXt6bapdZfMidyc41sh8AT1yZAuNRetaWSw8KN_EIvJBGilbHkIL_GIKI7joQdJcX-XNQDW8Npml9jNBQt-R3iDEVukEN6cLJheM%3D&amp;amp;tracking_referrer=www.bbc.co.uk"&gt;post-orgasmic illness syndrome (POIS)&lt;/a&gt;, causes flu-like symptoms, such as fatigue, brain fog, and muscle aches, immediately after ejaculation. It's believed to be an autoimmune or allergic reaction. Diagnosis is tricky, but skin testing with a man's own semen can yield a positive reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What about fertility?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seminal plasma hypersensitivity doesn't cause infertility directly, but it can complicate conception. Avoiding the allergen – usually the most effective treatment for allergies – isn't feasible for couples trying to conceive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jaci-inpractice.org/article/S2213-2198(20)30468-2/abstract"&gt;Treatments&lt;/a&gt; include prophylactic antihistamines (antihistamine medications taken in advance of anticipated exposure to an allergen, or before allergy symptoms are expected to appear to prevent or reduce the severity of allergic reactions), anti-inflammatories and &lt;a href="https://clinicalmolecularallergy.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-7961-6-13"&gt;desensitisation&lt;/a&gt; using diluted seminal plasma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In more severe cases, couples may choose &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/14647273.2013.800238"&gt;IVF with washed sperm&lt;/a&gt;, bypassing the allergic trigger altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note: SPH is not a form of infertility. Many women with SPH have conceived successfully – some naturally, others with medical support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why don't more people know about this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because sex-related symptoms often go unspoken. Embarrassment, stigma and a lack of awareness among doctors mean that many women suffer in silence.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcb5h42p000p3b6mpocu0zkx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The slides, posted online Tuesday, cite a 2008 study in the journal Neurotoxicology by “Berman RF, et al,” called “Low-level neonatal thimerosal exposure: Long-term consequences in the brain.” The presentation claimed that results from a study in newborn rats suggest long-term “neuroimmune effects” from the vaccine preservative.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcb53sy400073b6mw04746ku@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The citation appears to refer to &lt;a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/neurological-surgery/team/702/robert-berman---brain-injury-medicine---neurodevelopmental-disorders---neuroscience-research" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Robert F. Berman&lt;/a&gt;, a professor emeritus at the University of California Davis, whose research has focused on brain injury and neurodevelopmental disorders.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcb53sy400083b6m5vfcfpn4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, “I don’t have a publication in Neurotoxicology by that title,” Berman told CNN. “The reference in the slide set, as far as I know – at least with me as a coauthor – does not exist.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcb53sy400093b6m5lw9s5mg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Berman did publish a &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2F17977901%2F&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckatherine.dillinger%40cnn.com%7Cd245cbdd15d34b5749a808ddb374535b%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638864034458907421%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=tfut3SRLMS7VX%2Frt57ETWOo6hRpYC1sBRX63jWJG100%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;with a similar title in 2008, but it was in a different journal and involved different animals. It also came to dramatically different conclusions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcb53sy4000a3b6m6x3xtu07@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My study was published in Toxicological Sciences and did not find evidence of thimerosal exposure at vaccine levels in mouse behaviors that we thought were relevant to autism,” Berman said. He was “concerned and displeased” that his research appeared to have been cited in this way in Redwood’s slides.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcb7r8jp00003b6m43pfo8ee@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Redwood’s presentation was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-06-25-26/05-influenza-redwood.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;taken off&lt;/a&gt; the CDC website later Tuesday and replaced with a version that does not include Berman’s citation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The citation was first &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/drboulware.bsky.social/post/3lseub5gsy22z" target="_blank"&gt;flagged &lt;/a&gt;by &lt;a href="https://med.umn.edu/bio/david-boulware" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. David Boulware&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious diseases professor at the University of Minnesota, who told CNN, “The conclusion on that slide seemed really strong and definitive, and thus I wanted to look up the paper to see if the results matched their interpretation of it. … And I couldn’t find the citation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcb535kg00003b6m9ewxq270@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Neither Redwood nor HHS immediately responded to CNN’s request for comment on the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;presentation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcb53sy4000d3b6mbqiry3wu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The presentation already was &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/23/health/cdc-vaccine-meeting-thimerosal-lyn-redwood"&gt;controversial &lt;/a&gt;because thimerosal has been a focus of advocates who claim, against evidence, that it may cause autism because it contains a form of mercury. The preservative was taken out of most vaccines about 25 years ago as a precaution, and no evidence of neurodevelopmental effects has been found in multiple studies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcb53sy4000e3b6mi043xz0y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Redwood, though, said in a &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flive.childrenshealthdefense.org%2Fchd-tv%2Fevents%2Fthe-autism-cover-up-simpsonwood-scandal-25-years-of-fraud-and-corruption%2Fthimerosal-simpsonwood-safeminds-lyn-redwood%2F&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckatherine.dillinger%40cnn.com%7Cd245cbdd15d34b5749a808ddb374535b%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638864034458927842%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=UZKm%2FteTbUGJdGyAsKEJ6YiEzYOEHgSpFCziiFzYTyg%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; posted last month on Children’s Health Defense’s website that she believes thimerosal in pediatric vaccines led to her son’s autism.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcb53sy4000f3b6mko3vy6tr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The topic was a last-minute addition to the vaccine advisers’ agenda this week, sparking concerns among public health experts that it would raise debunked claims about vaccine safety. It was added after Kennedy dismissed all 17 previous experts on the influential vaccine panel, claiming they had conflicts of interest, and replaced them days later with eight new &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/13/health/cdc-new-vaccine-advisers"&gt;members&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcb55sv80000356ma5tol2ow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those members have raised concerns from the public health world and across the political spectrum, with Sen. Bill Cassidy, the Louisiana doctor who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/23/health/cdc-vaccine-advisers-meeting-cassidy"&gt;calling &lt;/a&gt;this week for the meeting to be postponed “until the panel is fully staffed with more robust and balanced representation – as required by law – including those with more direct relevant expertise.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcb53sy4000g3b6mjo87tkdz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s also not the first time a report in Kennedy’s realm has been found to have faulty citations. The initial version of the Trump administration’s Make America Healthy Again report, released last month and focused on children’s health, also &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2025%2F05%2F29%2Fhealth%2Fmaha-report-errors&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Ckatherine.dillinger%40cnn.com%7Cd245cbdd15d34b5749a808ddb374535b%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638864034458944256%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=%2B5t5JpxVxjr5Bcao41weSx16Kao9qT3gnXu9hoNgs0k%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;cited&lt;/a&gt; some studies that don’t exist. An HHS spokesperson called them “minor citation and formatting errors.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcb53sy4000h3b6m6rms8a16@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee on Tuesday, Kennedy was questioned by Rep. Raul Ruiz, a Democrat and doctor from California, about the MAHA report errors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcb5awta0002356mkfeth9e2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Why did the report include a citation to sources that don’t even exist?” Ruiz asked. “How does that happen under your leadership?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcb5r7yr0007356mklq936wk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy insisted that “all of the foundational assertions in that report are accurate” and said the mistaken citations “were corrected within 24 hours.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While metabolism is primarily influenced by genetics, you can boost it by increasing muscle mass. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-gaining-muscle-mass-11750809" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Muscle&lt;/a&gt; is metabolically active, meaning it requires more calories (compared to body fat) to function even at rest. One study found that pairing evening exercise with 45 grams of dietary protein before bed enhanced muscle repair during sleep, potentially boosting metabolism.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "The jury is out on whether our before-bedtime eating patterns significantly affect metabolism,” says &lt;a href="https://essentialnutritionforyou.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Rania Batayneh, M.P.H&lt;/a&gt;. Some studies show that high-calorie nighttime snacking can contribute to weight gain, partly due to unhealthy snack choices and mindless habits like watching TV.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the same time, research suggests that eating certain nutrient-rich foods at night may support better sleep and overall health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Foods high in tryptophan, like chicken, eggs, and beans, promote the production of serotonin and melatonin, improving sleep quality, which indirectly benefits metabolism.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Although metabolism naturally slows during sleep, a small, nutrient-dense snack before bed may aid muscle recovery, especially if paired with evening exercise, and help you feel energized the next day.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Toast isn't just for breakfast," Batayneh says. "Hummus is made with chickpeas, which are rich in B vitamins.

Choose tart cherries as a topping for their sweetness and their sleep-promoting powers. "Melatonin, perhaps the most well-known sleep-inducing hormone, regulates sleep-wake cycles. It's found in many fruits and vegetables, including tart cherries and pomegranates, as well as grains, nuts and seeds," Batayneh says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_84-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A small snack before bedtime may help with muscle recovery, especially when paired with pre-bed exercise.

And while none of these options have magical metabolism powers, they add a nutritional boost to your day.

			&lt;p&gt;The eyes can reveal a lot about the health of our brain. Indeed, problems with the eyes can be one of the earliest signs of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38424122/"&gt;latest study shows&lt;/a&gt; that a loss of visual sensitivity can predict dementia 12 years before it is diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research was based on 8,623 healthy people in Norfolk, England, who were followed up for many years. By the end of the study, 537 participants had developed dementia, so we could see what factors might have preceded this diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of the study, we asked participants to take a visual sensitivity test. For the test, they had to press a button as soon as they saw a triangle forming in a field of moving dots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who would develop dementia were much slower to see this triangle on the screen than people who would remain without dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why might that be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visual issues may be an early indicator of cognitive decline as the toxic amyloid plaques associated with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="165688" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease may first affect areas of the brain associated with vision, with parts of the brain associated with memory becoming damaged as the disease progresses. So vision tests may find deficits before memory tests do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-signal-of-future-alzheimers-could-be-hidden-in-the-way-you-speak?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;A Signal of Future Alzheimer's Could Be Hidden in The Way You Speak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20182034/"&gt;other aspects&lt;/a&gt; of visual processing that are affected in Alzheimer's disease, such as the ability to see outlines of objects (contrast sensitivity) and to discern between certain colours (the ability to see the blue-green spectrum is affected early in dementia), and these can affect people's lives without them being immediately aware it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aging-us.com/article/102118/text"&gt;Another&lt;/a&gt; early sign of Alzheimer's is a deficit in the "inhibitory control" of eye movements, where distracting stimuli seem to hold attention more readily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with Alzheimer's seem to have an issue ignoring distracting stimuli, which may show up as eye-movement-control issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If dementia makes it harder to avoid distracting stimuli, then these problems could increase the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.lboro.ac.uk/news-events/news/2023/october/dementia-driving-project-andrew-morris/"&gt;driving&lt;/a&gt; accidents – something we are currently investigating at Loughborough University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144904" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144904" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/EyeBehindTwoFingers642.jpg" alt="An eye with two fingers in the foreground" class="size-full wp-image-144904" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/EyeBehindTwoFingers642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/EyeBehindTwoFingers642-621x415.jpg 621w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/EyeBehindTwoFingers642-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144904" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Alzheimer's may show up as eye-movement-control issues.

People can sometimes sense when the person they are talking to does not do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, some doctors working with people with dementia will recognise that someone has dementia when they meet them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with dementia can sometimes seem lost, because they do not purposefully move their eyes to scan the environment, including that of the face of the people they have just met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would follow that you would then later be less able to recognise people as you have not imprinted their features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this early issue in not recognising people you have just met could be related to ineffective eye movement for new faces, rather than being a pure memory disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144903" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144903" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/SeniorLadyLookingConfused642.jpg" alt="An older lady in a black jacket sitting outdoors" class="size-full wp-image-144903" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/SeniorLadyLookingConfused642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/SeniorLadyLookingConfused642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/SeniorLadyLookingConfused642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144903" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;People with dementia can sometimes seem lost.

Perhaps that explains why we found that people who &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8391311/"&gt;watch more TV and read more&lt;/a&gt; have better memory and less dementia risk than those who do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While watching TV or reading, our eyes flick back and forth over the page and TV screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, people who read often also tend to have been in education longer. Having had good education provides brain reserve capacity so that when connections in the brain are damaged, the negative result is less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_134632" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-134632" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/GroupOfPeopleWatchingTV642.jpg" alt="A group of adults on a couch watching TV" class="size-full wp-image-134632" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/GroupOfPeopleWatchingTV642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/GroupOfPeopleWatchingTV642-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-134632" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Could watching TV actually be good for your brain?

We are not sure why this is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these exciting findings, treatment for memory problems using deliberate eye movements in older people has not been done that much yet. Also, using deficits in eye movements as a diagnostic is not a regular feature, despite the possibilities in eye movement technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the bottlenecks may be access to eye-tracking technologies, which are expensive and require training to use and analyse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until cheaper and easy-to-use eye trackers are available, using eye movements as a diagnostic tool for early-stage Alzheimer's is not possible outside the laboratory.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/226356/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viruses rely on hosts to survive. But some viruses are more effective at reproducing than others. Now, new research has shown that the herpes virus, more specifically herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), can change human DNA after less than an hour of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60534-6"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communication&lt;/em&gt;, the virus does more than just hijack the host’s cells. Instead, it makes fundamental changes to the human genome, allowing it to completely change the DNA of those infected to help power its reproduction.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, the researchers say the changes the herpes virus makes to human DNA are not a side effect. Instead, this reshaping is an intentional change. And once set up, the changes allow the virus to create the perfect space to multiply. While herpes can have more drastic effects, most of the time it usually only shows up as cold sores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is so prevalent, though, that it is estimated that more than two-thirds of people under the age of 50 carry the virus. However, it doesn’t always exhibit itself in everyone that is infected. When it does, it typically only does so during times of stress, illness, or immune suppression. But, as noted above, it can spread beyond that to cause encephalitis, which is inflammation of the brain, and even genital-based infections.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="bgr-newsletter-signup-form newsletter-signup-form black-bg"&gt;	&lt;h4&gt;Tech. Entertainment. Science.

However, once the herpes virus takes control of it, the RNA starts copying its own genes and making new copies of itself instead. This &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/mind-altering-parasite-takes-control-of-host-spiders-before-killing-them/"&gt;allows the virus to replicate&lt;/a&gt; at an unprecedented rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of control isn’t unseen in other viruses. Some virus-like parasites react in similar ways, taking over the cells of hosts to replicate their own. It’s one reason &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/up-to-50-of-all-people-are-infected-with-this-scary-parasite-study-says/"&gt;viruses are so difficult to combat&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily, the researchers found that one enzyme can block the virus from taking control like this. That makes this new enzyme, called TOP1, a viable contender for fighting the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research will hopefully provide some additional targets for new therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

two decades - and even gone backwards in some countries - a new global study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The situation has been made worse by the Covid pandemic, leaving millions of children unprotected from diseases such as measles, tuberculosis and polio. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The researchers are calling for a concerted effort to provide better and more equal access to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Child health experts warn that cuts to international aid budgets that fund vaccination programmes, combined with vaccine scepticism, are creating a "perfect storm".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The global childhood vaccination programme has been a huge success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Since 1974, more than four billion children have been vaccinated, preventing an estimated 150 million deaths worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In nearly half a century until 2023, researchers say vaccine coverage doubled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But since 2010 progress has stagnated, to the extent that there are now wide variations in vaccine coverage around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A study, published in the medical journal &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01037-2/fulltext" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;, says measles vaccinations have declined in nearly 100 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The Covid-19 pandemic made things even worse, because of disruption to vaccine programmes during lockdowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;By 2023, there were nearly 16 million children who had not had any childhood vaccinations – most of them in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Study author Dr Jonathan Mosser, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, in the United States, says large numbers of children remain under-vaccinated and un-vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Routine childhood vaccinations are among the most powerful and cost-effective public health interventions available, but persistent global inequalities, challenges from the Covid pandemic, and the growth of vaccine misinformation and hesitancy have all contributed to faltering immunisation progress," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Mosser said there was now increased the risk of outbreaks of diseases such as measles, polio and diphtheria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;All children should benefit from life-saving immunisations, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Wide discrepancies remain between vaccination rates in wealthier and lower-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But the report's authors warn that vaccination rates have fallen in Europe, the US and other wealthy countries too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Professor Sir Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, says the findings present a concerning picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"More children will be hospitalised, permanently damaged and die from fully preventable diseases if the trend is not reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Alas, the cuts in global health funding mean that this situation is set to deteriorate," Prof Pollard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr David Elliman, from University College London, says many factors have contributed to the current situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Around the world, the increasing number of countries torn apart by civil unrest and wars, combined with the drastic cuts in foreign aid from rich nations, such as USA and UK, makes it difficult to get vaccines to many populations," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Where it appears that policy is being made on the basis of ill-informed opinion, rather than science, we have a perfect storm," Dr Elliman added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The researchers recommend that all countries try to strengthen primary healthcare systems and combat misinformation around vaccines to prevent parents being hesitant about getting their children vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They also call for a concerted effort to provide better and more equal access to vaccines around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 23:09:02

class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p data-start="103" data-end="167"&gt;Some people call it aging gracefully. Others call it vitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="169" data-end="280"&gt;I call it showing up for your body like it’s a long-term partner—not just something to fix when it breaks down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="282" data-end="450"&gt;And here’s the thing: Staying youthful isn’t about reversing time. It’s about creating the conditions that keep your energy, clarity, and strength intact—on your terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="452" data-end="711"&gt;This post isn’t about ten-step skincare routines or expensive supplements. It’s about the small, daily rituals that quietly support your biology, emotional well-being, and resilience. Backed by research, tested in real life, and doable even on a busy Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="713" data-end="840"&gt;Let’s walk through seven self-care practices that don’t just feel good—they work like compound interest for your body and mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="847" data-end="896"&gt;1. Stretch your fascia, not just your muscles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="898" data-end="1103"&gt;Most of us treat stretching like the side salad of fitness: optional, forgettable, and kind of boring. But if you want to stay limber and pain-free into your sixties and beyond, it’s worth rethinking that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1105" data-end="1319"&gt;Here’s why: stretching doesn’t just loosen muscles—it hydrates your fascia. That’s the connective tissue webbing that wraps around your muscles and organs, and it gets stiff with age unless you move it regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1321" data-end="1592"&gt;According to Harvard Health, &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/dynamic-stretches?.com"&gt;dynamic stretching&lt;/a&gt; (like yoga or gentle mobility work) improves blood flow and flexibility, which directly supports posture, circulation, and even energy levels over time. And posture—yep—is a massive piece of how youthful we &lt;em data-start="1576" data-end="1582"&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; and feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1594" data-end="1778"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1594" data-end="1607"&gt;Try this:&lt;/strong&gt; Ten minutes of stretching in the morning or before bed. Focus on full-body movements like cat-cow, forward folds, or spinal twists. No need for headstands or fancy flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1785" data-end="1833"&gt;2. Eat like you’re feeding your future cells&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1835" data-end="1936"&gt;There’s a quiet revolution happening in nutrition—and it’s not about eating less, but eating smarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1938" data-end="2222"&gt;The science of aging is increasingly pointing to something called &lt;em data-start="2004" data-end="2027"&gt;cellular inflammation&lt;/em&gt; (aka “inflammaging”) as a key driver of everything from wrinkles to heart disease. And one of the best ways to fight it? Whole, plant-forward foods high in antioxidants, fiber, and healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2224" data-end="2437"&gt;In fact, a study found that participants who adopted a high-fiber, low-saturated-fat diet experienced better energy, reduced inflammation, and&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1542356520306856?.com"&gt; improved metabolic function&lt;/a&gt; within just two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2439" data-end="2608"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2439" data-end="2452"&gt;Try this:&lt;/strong&gt; Build meals around veggies, legumes, whole grains, and omega-3-rich foods like flaxseed or walnuts. Your body doesn’t need perfection—it needs consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2615" data-end="2675"&gt;3. Make friends with your parasympathetic nervous system&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2677" data-end="2740"&gt;Stress doesn’t just make you feel older—it actually &lt;em data-start="2729" data-end="2735"&gt;ages&lt;/em&gt; you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2742" data-end="2951"&gt;Chronic stress increases cortisol, a hormone that messes with your sleep, skin, and memory. But here’s the cool part: You can shift your nervous system into “rest and repair” mode with a few deliberate habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2953" data-end="3119"&gt;Simple breathwork practices like box breathing, humming, or even long exhales stimulate the vagus nerve, which tells your body it’s safe. This isn’t woo—it's biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3121" data-end="3318"&gt;A study found that people who practiced breath-based relaxation for just 10 minutes a day had &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1155134/full?.com"&gt;lower inflammation markers&lt;/a&gt; and better cognitive resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3320" data-end="3478"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3320" data-end="3333"&gt;Try this:&lt;/strong&gt; Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold again for 4. Do this while you’re waiting for your tea to steep or before sleep. It adds up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3485" data-end="3533"&gt;4. Prioritize sleep like it’s non-negotiable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3535" data-end="3581"&gt;We treat sleep like it’s negotiable. It’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3583" data-end="3881"&gt;According to neuroscientist &lt;a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Why-We-Sleep/Matthew-Walker/9781501144325"&gt;Dr. Matthew Walker&lt;/a&gt;, sleep is “the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day.” During deep sleep, your body clears waste from your brain, repairs tissues, and regulates hormones—processes that slow down aging and sharpen cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3883" data-end="4026"&gt;What’s more, lack of sleep disrupts your metabolism and makes your skin more prone to dullness and fine lines. It’s not vanity—it’s physiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4028" data-end="4216"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4028" data-end="4041"&gt;Try this:&lt;/strong&gt; Create a consistent wind-down routine. Dim the lights, ditch the screens an hour before bed, and keep your room cool and dark. Bonus points for reading something non-digital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4223" data-end="4262"&gt;5. Tend to your close relationships&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4264" data-end="4369"&gt;Here’s one of the biggest surprises from aging research: Relationships matter more than exercise or diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4371" data-end="4573"&gt;The Harvard Study of Adult Development—an 80+ year longitudinal study—found that close, supportive relationships were the &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/?.com"&gt;strongest predictor of long-term happiness&lt;/a&gt;, health, and even cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4575" data-end="4711"&gt;It’s not about having a million friends. It’s about having people you can be honest with. People who know your story, and still show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4713" data-end="4887"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4713" data-end="4726"&gt;Try this:&lt;/strong&gt; Reach out to one friend a week just to check in. Send a voice note. Share a funny memory. The older we get, the more intentional we need to be about connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4894" data-end="4940"&gt;6. Protect your attention like it’s sacred&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4942" data-end="5025"&gt;If your brain feels foggy, anxious, or constantly overstimulated—it’s not just you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5027" data-end="5274"&gt;Our attention is being pulled in a thousand directions every day. And the mental clutter adds up. Studies in &lt;em data-start="5136" data-end="5156"&gt;Cognitive Research&lt;/em&gt; show that multitasking and digital distraction&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280585944_Media_multitasking_and_memory_Differences_in_working_memory_and_long-term_memory?.com"&gt; erode memory&lt;/a&gt;, processing speed, and long-term concentration over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5276" data-end="5344"&gt;Think of your attention as a precious resource—not an unlimited tap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5346" data-end="5595"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5346" data-end="5359"&gt;Try this:&lt;/strong&gt; Set one or two “focus blocks” a day where your phone is on airplane mode. Use that time to think, read, journal, or just be with your own thoughts. You’d be amazed at how young your brain feels when it’s not juggling five tabs at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5602" data-end="5643"&gt;7. Move joyfully—not just efficiently&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5645" data-end="5757"&gt;There’s a psychological shift that happens when we start seeing movement as a tool for vitality, not punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5759" data-end="5924"&gt;Instead of counting reps or burning calories, try asking: &lt;em data-start="5817" data-end="5857"&gt;What kind of movement brings me alive?&lt;/em&gt; Dance classes? Walking in nature? Rebounding on a mini-trampoline?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5926" data-end="6132"&gt;Physical activity increases circulation, lubricates joints, and releases endorphins that protect against depression and cognitive decline. But when we do what we &lt;em data-start="6088" data-end="6095"&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt;, we’re more likely to stick with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6134" data-end="6271"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6134" data-end="6147"&gt;Try this:&lt;/strong&gt; Find one form of joyful movement you look forward to—not dread. That’s the stuff that sustains your health in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6278" data-end="6339"&gt;Aging is biological. How we age is personal.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6341" data-end="6494"&gt;You don’t need to overhaul your life to feel more vibrant. You just need to make quiet, consistent choices that support your body’s natural intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6496" data-end="6646"&gt;And remember: vitality isn’t about staying young forever. It’s about staying &lt;em data-start="6573" data-end="6578"&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;—with energy, clarity, and grounded confidence—as the years roll on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6648" data-end="6792"&gt;So stretch your body. Nourish your cells. Tend to your nervous system. Love your people. And protect your attention like the sacred thing it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6794" data-end="6869"&gt;Because how you treat yourself today… is how future you will feel tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

As Sebastian told the BBC, “Paloma's strategy was to appease, to be sweet, to try and win the love that she hadn't been granted earlier.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When Paloma was diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://people.com/dave-coulier-non-hodgkin-lymphoma-exclusive-8743523" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:non-Hodgkin lymphoma;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;non-Hodgkin lymphoma&lt;/a&gt; in late 2023, she was given a positive prognosis — 80% chance of survival — with &lt;a href="https://people.com/jeff-bridges-recalls-struggle-with-non-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-the-old-man-exclusive-8733924" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chemotherapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;chemotherapy&lt;/a&gt;; without it, the BBC reports, the cancer could be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, BBC reported that once Kate visited her daughter in the hospital, Paloma decided against chemotherapy, opting to treat her cancer with &lt;a href="https://people.com/apple-cider-vinegar-true-story-8786382" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gerson therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Gerson therapy&lt;/a&gt;, which involves juices, supplements, and enemas, and is not an approved treatment for cancer, the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/gerson-pdq" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Cancer Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt; notes.

A few days later, Paloma had died at 23 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kate responded to Paloma’s death by proclaiming in posts on &lt;a href="https://x.com/search?q=from%3AKateShemirani%20paloma&amp;amp;src=typed_query" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:X;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;X&lt;/a&gt; that she had been murdered and that her death had been covered up. “Medicine is a lie and what we once believed to be healthcare is now a homicide service,” she wrote, later calling her daughter’s death &lt;a href="https://x.com/KateShemirani/status/1898327179009647041" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:“one big massive manslaughter case;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;“one big massive manslaughter case&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sebastian placed the blame for his sister's death squarely on his mother, and told the BBC&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;“My sister has passed away as a direct consequence of my mum’s actions and beliefs.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOLEDO, Ohio — A new COVID-19 variant known as NB.1.8.1 — nicknamed “Nimbus” and ominously referred to as “&lt;a href="/article/news/nation-world/covid-variant-razor-blade-sore-throats/507-eb4fc5f8-9260-421c-b1fe-a4cee7204107" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;razor-blade throat&lt;/a&gt;” — is raising alarms among health experts overseas.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variant, which has been identified in several Asian countries, is drawing attention for its unusually severe throat symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With this virus, it tends to produce a very sore throat,” said Dr. Brian Kaminski, vice president of Medical Affairs at ProMedica. “You could get one with previous variants, but this one seems to be particularly bad.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the painful symptoms and high transmissibility, Kaminski emphasized that the variant does not appear to cause more severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The good news is, it doesn’t seem to cause more severe illness,” he said. “And it does respond to the current vaccines. That means even if you get sick, you're much less likely to have life-threatening symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaminski said Tuesday no confirmed cases of the variant have been reported in the U.S., but he believes it’s only a matter of time before it makes its way stateside.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toledoans are taking notice, with many expressing concerns and a desire for more information.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s already here, we just aren’t really aware of it and not a lot of people know about it,” said one resident, Jona BanDelaria. “I think they need to investigate more about it and see if it’s really here, so we can avoid spreading it.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Toledo resident, Claudio Escandell, stressed the importance of staying informed.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The more information you can have about this thing, the more protected you’ll be,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials recommend keeping up with vaccine boosters and monitoring public health updates as more data emerges.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

Researchers found that low ApoM impairs cholesterol metabolism in the retina, contributing to inflammation and vision loss—especially in advanced forms like geographic atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mouse models, boosting ApoM improved retinal health and reduced cholesterol buildup by activating a protective signaling pathway with sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). The findings suggest a potential therapy that could not only preserve vision but also benefit patients with heart failure, which shares similar cholesterol-processing dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ApoM Deficiency:&lt;/strong&gt; Low ApoM disrupts cholesterol metabolism in the eye and heart, triggering inflammation and cell damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Raising ApoM levels improved retinal health and reduced lipid buildup in mouse models of AMD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Benefit:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may lead to new treatments for both macular degeneration and heart failure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;WUSTL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis identifies a possible way to slow or block progression of age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in people over age 50. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WashU Medicine researchers and their international collaborators implicated problems with cholesterol metabolism in this type of vision loss, perhaps helping to explain the links between macular degeneration and cardiovascular disease, which both worsen with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111144"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AMD-protein-neuroscicne.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AMD-protein-neuroscicne-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AMD-protein-neuroscicne-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AMD-protein-neuroscicne-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AMD-protein-neuroscicne-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AMD-protein-neuroscicne-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AMD-protein-neuroscicne-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AMD-protein-neuroscicne.jpg" alt="This shows an eye." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AMD-protein-neuroscicne.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AMD-protein-neuroscicne-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AMD-protein-neuroscicne-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AMD-protein-neuroscicne-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AMD-protein-neuroscicne-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AMD-protein-neuroscicne-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/AMD-protein-neuroscicne-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In macular degeneration, doctors can see cholesterol-rich deposits under the retina during an eye exam, according to Apte. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings — identified using human plasma samples and mouse models of macular degeneration — suggest that increasing the amount of a molecule called apolipoprotein M (ApoM) in the blood fixes problems in cholesterol processing that lead to cellular damage in the eyes and other organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various methods of dialing up ApoM could serve as new treatment strategies for age-related macular degeneration and perhaps some forms of heart failure triggered by similar dysfunctional cholesterol processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study appears June 24 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study points to a possible way to address a major unmet clinical need,” said senior author Rajendra S. Apte, MD, PhD, the Paul A. Cibis Distinguished Professor of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences at WashU Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Current therapies that reduce the chance of further vision loss are limited to only the most advanced stages of macular degeneration and do not reverse the disease. Our findings suggest that developing treatments that increase ApoM levels could treat or even prevent the disease and therefore preserve people’s vision as they age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In macular degeneration, doctors can see cholesterol-rich deposits under the retina during an eye exam, according to Apte. In early stages, vision might still be normal, but the deposits increase inflammation and other damaging processes the lead to the gradual loss of central vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the most common type, “dry” macular degeneration, the cells in the central part of the retina can be damaged, causing a type of neurodegeneration called geographic atrophy, which is similar to what happens in the brain in conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease. Dry macular degeneration can turn into “wet” macular degeneration, in which abnormal blood vessel growth damages vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geographic atrophy and wet macular degeneration are advanced forms of the disease that are accompanied by vision loss. Although some approved therapies for advanced disease are available, the disease process itself is not reversible at that stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A common culprit in eye disease and heart failure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, evidence has emerged that ApoM can serve as a protective molecule with known anti-inflammatory effects and roles in maintaining healthy cholesterol metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, Apte and co-senior author Ali Javaheri, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of medicine, were interested assessing whether reduced ApoM levels, which fall with age, could be involved in the dysfunctional cholesterol metabolism that is at the root of multiple diseases of aging, including macular degeneration and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They showed that patients with macular degeneration have reduced levels of ApoM circulating in the blood compared with healthy controls. And past work by Javaheri, a WashU Medicine cardiologist, showed that patients with various forms of heart failure also had reduced levels of ApoM in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study revealed that ApoM is a key component in the “good cholesterol” pathways that mop up excess cholesterol — the bad kind that tends to drive inflammation — and clear it from the body through the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apte and Javaheri’s research suggests that when ApoM is low, cells in the retina and heart muscle can’t correctly metabolize cholesterol deposits and have a hard time getting rid of these accumulating lipids. When these lipids build up, it leads to inflammation and cellular damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see if they could reverse the harmful effects of low ApoM, the researchers increased ApoM levels in mouse models of macular degeneration, using genetic modification or plasma transfer from other mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice showed evidence of improved retinal health, improved function of light-sensing cells in the retina and reduced accumulation of cholesterol deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers further found evidence that ApoM triggers a signaling pathway that breaks down the cholesterol in cellular compartments called lysosomes, which are known for playing important roles in disposing of cellular waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that ApoM must be bound to a molecule called sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) to get the beneficial effects of ApoM treatment in the mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apte and Javaheri are working with Mobius Scientific, a WashU startup company that is working to harness this knowledge of the role of ApoM in macular degeneration to develop new approaches to treating or preventing the disease. Apte and Javaheri worked with WashU’s Office of Technology Management (OTM) to launch Mobius Scientific in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings also could have implications for future interventions that raise ApoM in patients with heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the exciting things about this collaboration is realizing the links between retinal pigment epithelial cells and heart muscle cell, which are both vulnerable to low ApoM,” Javeheri said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is possible that the interaction between ApoM and S1P is regulating cholesterol metabolism in both cell types. We look forward to exploring strategies to increase ApoM in ways that could help the eye and the heart maintain healthy cholesterol metabolism over time and stave off two major diseases of aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH), grant numbers R01 EY019287, P30 EY02687, 1T32GM1397740-1, K08HL138262, 1R01HL155344, P30DK020579 and P30DK056341; the Jeffrey T.

AMD and cardiovascular disease share risk factors including age, impaired lipid metabolism, and extracellular lipid deposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of its importance in age-related diseases, we hypothesize that apolipoprotein M (ApoM), a lipocalin that binds sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), might restore lipid homeostasis and retinal function in AMD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In support, we find that human patients with AMD demonstrate significantly reduced ApoM compared to controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice with impaired retinal cholesterol efflux, ApoM improves retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) function and lipotoxicity in an S1P- and S1P receptor 3-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultrastructural evidence of enhanced melanosome-lipid droplet interactions led us to hypothesize and demonstrate that ApoM-S1P signaling drives RPE-specific lysosomal lipid catabolism. RPE-specific knockout of lysosomal acid lipase recapitulates features of AMD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study defines a novel role for ApoM/S1P signaling in AMD driven by RPE lipotoxicity, mediated by cell-autonomous lysosomal lipid catabolism.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 21:19:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiY0FVX3lxTE5HMVBqRHF5bHpsUEVtV1J0U3ZLSmxlb01ZY0U1S2dYY1g5a2w2ZUwtNG1wdkxOM0VHUlhXXzkzSFVDRjNyUFRRUDIyLTc0QVhyN25ZMlBWRFJTSWpsUERRVWhmNA</guid></item><item><title>犹他州卫生部门表示，又有2名成年人被诊断出患有麻疹- KSL.com | 2 more adults diagnosed with measles, Utah health department says - KSL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxNUjNzY2dtRnd2eE9zQkxjdjNsY2JiVnlaX0ZZMmh3SXM0SnNYUGhycHlRbC1KREJCcGdKSU5XbzlGQ1o0R3R3VzZFUk5CeWo4UTZacFk0V1QwS2RCc3Zod2lXWEhiOUljRDJZNkh6N0d2Wm91bjlJMEhiXzg5YzA5WHZnVEViOFRjNC1aVVZPcjZyZ1Ewb0xFTkgyeG1DekZmN1NteQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY —  Two more adults in Utah have been diagnosed with the measles, bringing the total cases to three, state health officials announced Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the new cases is a Utah County resident and the other is from the southwest health district, according to a news release from the &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Utah Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51333214/utahs-first-measles-case-in-years-reported-in-utah-county" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;Last week's diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; was the first case of measles to originate in Utah in at least two years, the department said. That person was also an adult in Utah County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three individuals are unvaccinated, and they are not connected to one another, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Public health investigations are ongoing to identify any locations where possible exposures may have occurred," the news release stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said during the first person's "infectious period but prior to diagnosis," the person visited "several" public places. This included the Timpanogos Regional Emergency Room on June 14 between 2:14 p.m. and 7:02 p.m., and the Parkway Health Center in Orem on June 13, though no specific time was given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Leisha Nolen, Utah's state epidemiologist, said the individual visited health care providers due to symptoms of the measles and was advised to stay home to quarantine, which they reportedly did following their diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People who were at these sites at the same time, or two hours after this person, could have been exposed to measles," the department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials urged those who may have crossed paths with the infected Utah County resident, especially those who are unvaccinated, to watch for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do have to suspect there are additional measles cases in Utah," Nolen said, noting the affected individual had not traveled outside of the state, pointing to the disease originating from Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early stages of measles symptoms — high fever, cough, runny nose or red eyes — usually appear seven to 14 days after exposure. A rash typically appears after four days of fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has been exposed to measles or is showing symptoms should call a health care provider first before visiting a clinic to prevent spreading the disease to others, the department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A large majority of Utahns (more than 90%) have been vaccinated against measles and are highly protected against infection," the health department said. "Measles is a highly contagious disease that can cause serious illness, especially in young children, pregnant women and people who have weakened immune systems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

That’s because someone with measles can be contagious from four days before their rash appears until four days afterward, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NDU4LNNH7NCCHMMII7G52OXVRY"&gt;“After exposure, it can take up to three weeks before you show the characteristic measles rash. So, someone could not even know they have measles and be transmitting it for several days,” Cieslak said. “That’s why it’s extremely important that all adults and children in their household be up to date on vaccinations.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MTOCNHNNAZE55EUXKNCZBEZ7PM"&gt;Cieslak said that anyone who develops measles-like symptoms or may have been exposed to the virus should call their health care provider before going to a clinic or hospital to avoid spreading the virus to others in waiting rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SXTN3NVWMNCO5NO5ANJYOPHHCI"&gt;Measles is notoriously contagious — it spreads through the air via coughing or sneezing, and the virus can linger in a room for up to two hours after an infected person has left.

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;A study has linked drinking alcohol to health issues later in life such as cognitive decline and dementia-related diseases, including Alzheimer’s. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They found that moderate and heavy and former heavy alcohol users did have pathologic changes in the brain,” said Dr. Lisa Shulman, a professor of neurology at the University of Maryland, and director of the school’s movement and memory disorder division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically two types of changes: neurofibrillary tangles, which are associated with Alzheimer’s disease, and hyaline arteriolosclerosis, which essentially is a hardening of the small blood vessels called arterioles. These impair blood supply to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavy drinkers were described as having eight drinks per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000213555" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The study published&lt;/a&gt; in the “Neurology” journal in May examined around 1,700 autopsies and gathered family history, including alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alcohol has broad negative effects on many systems of the body,” Shulman said. “Most people know that it can affect the liver, but it can cause cancer, it can affect heart function. As a matter of fact, we are very accustomed in neurology to seeing people who are very heavy alcohol users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issues with the brain were not the only findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The heavy drinkers died much younger, on average, actually about 64 as compared to between 74 and 78 between the other groups,” Shulman said.&lt;/p&gt;

The chemical engineer said that by March 2024, she was bedridden and had lost 20 lbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Why was my body failing me? I’ve always lived a healthy lifestyle, this didn’t make any sense. It quickly became clear that this wasn’t something I could fix with a balanced diet or exercise,” Palen recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said doctors initially thought she might have an autoimmune disease, “but the truth was far from that.” Palen said that tiny organisms called Babesia had entered her bloodstream via a tick bite, targeting her red blood cells and leaving her “trapped in unbearable pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24809-babesiosis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, there are fewer than 3,000 annual cases of Babesiosis reported in the United States, but the illness can be life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Palen's case, the illness “completely shattered my immune system,” she recalled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy News &amp;amp; Media&lt;/p&gt; Maria Palen doing occupational therapy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It became so bad that something as simple as locking my phone or turning my car’s wheel became moments of agony,” Palen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a follow-up &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fp%2FDEQ1l1YP1X0%2F%3Fhl%3Den&amp;amp;is_from_rle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; shared in December 2024, Palen said that she was paralyzed after an October incident during which her tailbone began to ache and she felt feverish. Days later, her symptoms made it difficult to sit through a work meeting, leaving her feeling so weak she could hardly stand. Palen was taken to the hospital, where her health continued to deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once the pain meds kicked in at the hospital, my legs started going numb. First the left, then the right, until it crept all the way up to my belly button,” Palen said in the video. “Turns out my spinal fluid was loaded with white blood cells. Something was definitely attacking my spinal cord and even now, doctors can’t pinpoint exactly what it was.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy News &amp;amp; Media&lt;/p&gt; Maria Palen.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palen said she’s convinced the issues are related to Lyme Disease. Doctors gave her antibiotics, which she said cleared the infection, “but by then, the damage was done.” Palen said in the video that she was trying to be "patient" as she waited for her nerves to heal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/xzbuy-support-marias-journey-to-healing" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoFundMe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; set up in January to support Palen has since raised more than $12,000.

&lt;p&gt;RALEIGH, N.C. — A measles case was confirmed in North Carolina in a child traveling from another country who visited Forsyth and Guilford Counties, according to the North Carolina Department of Human Services (NCDHHS).&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials said this is the first case found in North Carolina in 2025. The NCDHHS recommends anyone who visited the locations listed below last week to call their doctor to review immunization records and make sure they are up to date on the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NCDHHS said 90% of unvaccinated individuals will become infected, with babies, young children and pregnant people most at risk of complications.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the locations and times impacted.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Measles Symptoms:&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High fever, rash, cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes. Sometimes, small, white bumps or spots can appear in the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, a rash appears on the head or face and then spreads to other parts of the body. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Babies, young children and pregnant people are at higher risk for measles complications like ear infections, diarrhea, pneumonia, immune amnesia (when your body forgets how to fight off other serious diseases), brain inflammation and death.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;When Symptoms Develop:&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms can develop between 7 to 21 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How Measles Spreads:&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus is very contagious and can be spread before a rash appears. It lives in the nose and throat, so when a carrier talks, sneezes or coughs, tiny droplets with the virus spray into the air. They can stay in the air and contaminate surfaces for up to two hours.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What To Do If You Were Exposed:&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locate your vaccination records or other evidence of immunity, you're not very likely to get measles if you have the MMR vaccine or other evidence of immunity.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not immune, call your doctor and inform them of your exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, stay home for 21 days after measles exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to Prevent Measles:&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to prevent measles is to get vaccinated with two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

Both were unvaccinated, the department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;According to the department, the new infections are not related to Utah’s first measles case, &lt;a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/06/20/utah-measles-case-reported-utah/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/06/20/utah-measles-case-reported-utah/"&gt;reported last Friday&lt;/a&gt;. In that case, an unvaccinated Utah County resident was reported infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The person whose case was reported Friday spent hours in Orem’s Timpanogos Regional ER on Saturday, June 14, the department reported — and an unknown amount of time the day before at the Parkway Health Center in Orem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Public health investigators are working to identify where the two new infected people might have exposed others, the department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;In early June, &lt;a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/06/04/utah-officials-warn-potential/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/06/04/utah-officials-warn-potential/"&gt;DHHS reported&lt;/a&gt; that an infected out-of-state person traveled through Utah’s Washington County, visiting family in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Measles symptoms typically appear seven to 14 days after exposure. They include a high fever — above 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit — and a cough, runny nose, or red eyes. A rash will usually appear within four days of a fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;If you develop symptoms, stay away from other people and call your health care provider, health officials say. Call before going to a clinic or hospital, so staff there can prevent other people from exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;According to DHHS, more than 90% of Utahns have been vaccinated against measles, and are well protected against infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;As of Thursday, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported&lt;/a&gt; a total of 1,214 confirmed measles cases in 34 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a developing story.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Salt Lake Tribune</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 20:29:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE1yQWhXdElBVWxiME9kUFZVM1hQUkNTWmljOURQdjYtanp6TldCQVNMSUFha1JPbFdhM3RNQ18wV0tzR0E5d3hGb2Y3bUVUTEVLN1FGOTVEWF93YVIwejN5aW1rOXBuN1haak5TMEFWclVTU1VybnBQZTg3OF8</guid></item><item><title>科学家刚刚发现了姜黄的惊人益处- EatingWell | Scientists Just Discovered a Surprising Benefit of Turmeric - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTE5mQlk4N1B3aTdBZWUwTFQxa3BoRUVMZVdseFRuWGEwdDhhYkVUejFQQnYzd3ZSOHBCZXNfQkRib3B4SHpYbmhodmNYaHVmbGZkVXcya1ZfRVIxUW1pZ0NqbS0xU1h4NG5SQW9V?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new review of studies found that turmeric may help improve blood pressure, cholesterol and more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Older people without dementia experienced better cognitive health while taking turmeric.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can also get more turmeric by using it in your cooking or by taking turmeric shots.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Turmeric, the bright golden spice often found in kitchens around the world, has grown into much more than a culinary staple. Over the past few decades, its reputation as a natural remedy has skyrocketed, thanks largely to curcumin, which is a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-spice-for-metabolic-syndrome-11678783" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;powerful compound within turmeric&lt;/a&gt; that’s believed to drive its many health benefits. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; From teas and smoothies to capsules and gummies, turmeric has appeared in countless forms, establishing itself as the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-turmeric-supplements-8602203" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;best-selling botanical dietary supplement&lt;/a&gt; in the United States.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Its rise hasn’t just been fueled by traditional remedies—science has also taken a keen interest, with researchers digging into turmeric’s potential to support everything from joint health to brain function. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But even with all of this enthusiasm, it’s important to note that not all claims about turmeric’s powers are created equal. While clinical studies from around the globe have explored its medicinal and therapeutic benefits, questions remain about which effects are backed by the strongest evidence. This is where large-scale, carefully designed studies come into play; they help distinguish proven health effects from those that need more investigation. And for everyone from curious consumers to health professionals, understanding the full scientific picture of turmeric can help ensure people get the most benefit from this golden spice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Though many studies have shown the health benefits of curcumin in turmeric, there’s still a need for stronger research to determine which benefits are backed by reliable evidence. To bridge this gap, researchers looked at how safe and effective curcumin is for improving human health and wellness when taken orally, comparing it to other treatments to better understand its therapeutic potential, and the results were published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Pharmacology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To better understand the health benefits of turmeric, researchers conducted an extensive review of existing studies, referred to as an umbrella review. This type of review combines evidence from multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses to assess the links between turmeric (and its active compound, curcumin) and various health outcomes. Essentially, it helps paint a clear picture of the overall impact of turmeric on health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The review included studies that met specific criteria to ensure quality and relevance. These studies came from six different regions, with most being from Iran (16) and China (6), while the rest came from Australia, Singapore and India. Interestingly, the studies also had a wide range in how turmeric, specifically curcumin, was tested. Doses ranged from just 50 mg to as high as 6,000 mg, and treatment durations varied from just a day to an entire year. Some studies compared turmeric to a placebo, while others compared it to regular care or medication.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To conduct this analysis, researchers started by looking through 1,628 records from various sources that focused on turmeric health benefits. After using specific criteria for inclusion, the researchers selected 25 key studies for the review. These articles provided the best evidence on the topic and formed the basis of our findings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This research highlighted that, indeed, curcumin supplementation may &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/80991/10-ways-to-reduce-inflammation/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower markers of inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). These benefits have been observed in adults with conditions like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mediterranean-diet-arthritis-study-11740419" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt; and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), where it also improved certain antioxidant levels in the body. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This data also showed that curcumin, the active compound in turmeric, might play a significant role in supporting people with conditions like type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/pcos-symptoms-8641812" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;polycystic ovarian syndrome&lt;/a&gt; (PCOS). While this data confirmed some benefits that many are already familiar with, it also suggested some less-known potential benefits, including:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Blood Pressure:&lt;/strong&gt; Turmeric supplements may help lower systolic blood pressure by about 2 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by less than 1 mmHg in adults. But evidence also suggests it doesn’t significantly lower blood pressure for people with certain liver conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Cholesterol and Triglycerides:&lt;/strong&gt; Curcumin may help in reducing total cholesterol, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol, while slightly increasing "good" HDL cholesterol. Among people with type 2 diabetes, its effects on LDL and HDL cholesterol were not significant. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Health Support:&lt;/strong&gt; Curcumin may help reduce anxiety and depression symptoms in some individuals. It may also help improve levels of a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is important for brain health. For older adults, curcumin has been linked to better cognitive function, although it doesn’t appear to significantly improve depression in this group. However, findings are mixed; people with Alzheimer’s disease didn’t see benefits and, in some cases, performed worse in cognitive tests when taking curcumin. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less Menstrual Cramp Pain: &lt;/strong&gt;Curcumin may help reduce the severity of menstrual cramps and premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms. For women with PMS, taking curcumin significantly alleviated physical discomfort, mood-related issues and behavioral symptoms when compared to a placebo. Similarly, for women experiencing primary dysmenorrhea, curcumin has been effective in decreasing the intensity of cramps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It is important to note that several studies have reported some &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/turmeric-benefits-8785974" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;side effects when taking a turmeric supplement&lt;/a&gt;, which included stomach-related issues like bloating, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea and constipation. Thankfully, no serious side effects were found in these studies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study does have some limitations that should be considered. First, while the researchers aimed to collect comprehensive information, most of the studies the researchers analyzed did not register their research protocols. This lack of registration can reduce the transparency and reliability of the findings. Additionally, the review was limited to studies available in English databases, which means the researchers might have missed relevant research published in other languages.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another issue is that the evidence they examined was drawn from existing reviews, which may have left out specific details from the original studies or included overlapping studies. There were also differences among the studies in terms of participants, interventions, and how outcomes were measured, which could impact the consistency and accuracy of the results. Lastly, not all the studies we evaluated were of high quality, meaning that some of the evidence may carry potential biases. These factors highlight the need for continued research to strengthen the foundation of knowledge in this area.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Integrating turmeric into your daily routine doesn’t just have to be for a flavor boost or a pop of sunny color. As this overview of research observes, turmeric offers &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-anti-inflammatory-benefits-11754770" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory benefits&lt;/a&gt;, and it may also be able to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/choline-dementia-study-8779484" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;improve cholesterol, blood pressure and cognition&lt;/a&gt;. And enjoying turmeric—either out of the spice cabinet or as a supplement—doesn’t have to be difficult.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re someone who deals with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-for-arthritis-8611187" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stiff joints&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, adding a turmeric supplement into your smoothies might offer some relief, thanks to its anti-inflammatory properties. Similarly, for those managing conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or even looking to improve mental health, the evidence suggests turmeric may provide additional support when combined with other treatments and healthy lifestyle choices.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On a broader level, turmeric’s growing popularity has made it accessible in countless everyday products, from teas and lattes to capsules and snack bars. This means people don’t have to overhaul their routines entirely to tap into its potential. Whether you’re drinking a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/258547/turmeric-latte/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;golden latte&lt;/a&gt; to start your day, adding a pinch of turmeric to your dinner recipes or exploring supplements after consulting a healthcare professional, there are many ways to incorporate this golden spice into your life.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just remember, while turmeric shows promise, moderation and evidence-based choices are key, especially when navigating the many claims surrounding its benefits.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new review in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers of Pharmacology &lt;/em&gt;suggests that turmeric has several potential benefits, including &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7908639/the-fastest-way-to-reduce-inflammation/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lowering chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, supporting mental health and managing conditions like type 2 diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Additionally, the curcumin in turmeric has shown promise in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/spices-to-relieve-pms-symptoms-8384644" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;easing symptoms of PMS&lt;/a&gt; and menstrual cramps and even &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/polyphenols-reduce-cognitive-decline-11680121" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;supporting cognitive function&lt;/a&gt; in certain cases.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, the evidence also reveals some limitations and variability in turmeric’s effects. Mixed results have been observed in specific populations, such as older adults and individuals with Alzheimer’s disease, particularly concerning its impact on mental health outcomes. Additionally, it’s important to recognize that turmeric is not a universal solution, as individual responses can differ significantly—and you may experience uncomfortable side effects.&lt;br&gt;

The child became ill while traveling to NC from another country where measles outbreaks have recently been reported. To protect the individual and their family’s privacy, no additional information about this individual will be released. This is the first confirmed case of measles in the state in 2025. NCDHHS is recommending all unvaccinated individuals ages one year and older receive measles vaccination to protect themselves and those around them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NCDHHS is working closely with the Forsyth County Department of Public Health and Guilford County Health Department to identify locations and times where people might have been exposed to measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you visited a listed location during the dates and times below, review your immunization records or contact your health care provider to make sure you are up to date on the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laboratory testing is not recommended for people who were exposed unless they develop symptoms of measles, including fever and rash. Symptoms of measles can start seven to 21 days after being exposed. If symptoms develop, please call ahead before visiting the doctor or emergency room so steps can be taken to prevent exposure to others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some situations, people who have been exposed to measles may be eligible to receive post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to reduce their risk of becoming ill. The timeframe for PEP has passed for most people who were potentially exposed to this case, but those who are at higher risk — including infants too young to receive MMR vaccination, immunocompromised individuals or pregnant women — should contact their doctor or local health department to see if PEP is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Getting vaccinated against measles continues to be the most important step we can take to protect ourselves and our loved ones,” said NC Health and Human Services Secretary Dev Sangvai. “It is important to check with your health care provider to ensure you are current with all your vaccines.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Carolina residents can contact their health care provider or visit their local health department for additional information on ways to obtain the vaccine and schedule an appointment. Children eligible for the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/about/index.html"&gt;Vaccines for Children&lt;/a&gt; program may receive the vaccine from a provider enrolled in that program.

Credentialed media should RSVP for the link by emailing &lt;a href="mailto:news@dhhs.nc.gov"&gt;news@dhhs.nc.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious, vaccine-preventable disease that is spread by direct person-to-person contact and through the air. The virus can live for up to two hours in the air where the infected person was present. Symptoms of measles usually begin 7-14 days after exposure, but can appear up to 21 days after exposure and may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever (may spike to more than 104 degrees)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tiny white spots on the inner cheeks, gums and roof of the mouth (Koplik Spots) two to three days after symptoms begin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rash that is red, raised, blotchy; usually starts on face, spreads to trunk, arms and legs three to five days after symptoms begin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the risk for community spread, parents are encouraged to make sure their children are up to date on all their childhood immunizations, including the measles vaccine. 90% percent of unvaccinated individuals who are exposed to measles will become infected. About one in five people who get measles will be hospitalized. In addition to North Carolina’s case, 1,214 measles cases have been reported in 2025 in 36 other jurisdictions as of June 19, 2025.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

(KATU) — &lt;/span&gt; The Oregon Health Authority (OHA) and county public health officials are investigating the state's first confirmed measles case of 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The individual, an unvaccinated adult, recently returned to Oregon following international travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case was confirmed on June 23. The individual began experiencing symptoms, including a sore throat, weakness, fatigue, headache, and fever, on June 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were hospitalized in the Portland metro area with a rash and conjunctivitis on June 19 and discharged on June 21. Officials believe no patients were exposed during the hospitalization, and the individual is currently recovering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials suspect the disease was contracted during the individual's recent international travel, which spanned four to five weeks. This case is not linked to any measles outbreaks in other U.S. states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're here to tell you that measles is now in Oregon, and if you’re not vaccinated, you are susceptible," said Paul R. Cieslak, M.D., medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations at OHA’s Public Health Division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ ALSO:&lt;a href="https://katu.com/news/nation-world/cdc-provides-new-measles-vaccine-guidance-with-summer-travel-season-underway" target="_blank" title="https://katu.com/news/nation-world/cdc-provides-new-measles-vaccine-guidance-with-summer-travel-season-underway" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt; CDC provides new measles vaccine guidance with summer travel season underway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You could get measles if you're exposed to someone who is contagious, which can be from four days before their rash starts until four days after. After exposure, it can take up to three weeks before you show the characteristic measles rash. So, someone could not even know they have measles and be transmitting it for several days. That’s why it’s extremely important that all adults and children in their household be up to date on vaccinations," Cieslak added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potential exposure locations include Flight UA1832/SN8869 (Brussels Air operated by United Airlines) on June 17, Portland International Airport arrivals and baggage claim on the same day, and a Safeway in Lake Oswego on June 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nonmedical vaccine exemptions for kindergartners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, the OHA reported that Oregon had a record-high nonmedical vaccine exemption for kindergartners, but most families continued to vaccinate their kids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A record 9.7% of kindergartners in the state have claimed nonmedical exemptions from school vaccination requirements for the 2024-2025 school year, marking the highest rate ever recorded in the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This increase continues an upward trend from 8.8% in 2024, when Oregon had the fourth-highest nonmedical exemption rate in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the rise in exemptions, &lt;a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oregon.immunization.program/viz/OregonMeaslesImmunizationData/StateRates" target="_blank" title="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oregon.immunization.program/viz/OregonMeaslesImmunizationData/StateRates" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;data from the Oregon Immunization Program &lt;/a&gt;at OHA’s Public Health Division indicates that 86.3% of kindergartners were fully vaccinated with all required immunizations for the current school year, a slight decrease from 86.4% last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stacy de Assis Matthews, school immunization coordinator at the Oregon Immunization Program, emphasized the importance of high vaccination rates in protecting public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "An immunized community is our most effective defense against diseases such as measles," Matthews said. "Robust vaccination coverage not only protects individual children but also safeguards those who cannot be vaccinated due to age, medical conditions, or other vulnerabilities, helping protect our communities in Oregon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For students across all grades, from kindergarten through 12th grade, 90.4% were fully vaccinated in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="https://katu.com/news/local/senators-urge-hhs-to-launch-national-measles-vaccination-campaign-merkley-wyden-oregon" target="_blank" title="https://katu.com/news/local/senators-urge-hhs-to-launch-national-measles-vaccination-campaign-merkley-wyden-oregon" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Senators urge HHS to launch national measles vaccination campaign amid outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Oregon senators pushed for vaccinations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, U.S. Senators of Oregon Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley called on Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to take immediate action to curb the spread of measles in the United States. The plea followed the first measles-related deaths in the country in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter to Secretary Kennedy, the senators highlighted the urgency of the situation. Although Secretary Kennedy chaired the anti-vaccine nonprofit Children's Health Defense from 2015 to 2023, he wrote an op-ed on March 2 this year for &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" target="_blank" title="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; in which he calls MMR vaccines "crucial" to avoiding deadly disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Measles outbreak is call to action for all of us," the op-ed is titled. "Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is imperative that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) act immediately and robustly to stop the spread of this preventable infection and save American lives," the senators wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawmakers emphasized the need to increase vaccination rates to protect vulnerable populations. "More must be done to increase vaccination rates against measles. Clear communication that vaccines work is imperative to build trust and increase uptake of vaccinations, ultimately saving lives," they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter, led by Senator Ben Ray Luján and signed by several other senators, also stressed the importance of reinstating public health workers who were indiscriminately fired by the previous administration. "We urgently request that you reinstate all fired federal health workers and protect those remaining from termination to help stop the spread of measles and other infectious diseases," the senators concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms and immune amnesia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles spreads through the air after an infected person coughs or sneezes, with the virus lingering for up to two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms typically start with a fever, cough, runny nose, and red eyes, followed by &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/photos.html?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/photos.html?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;a rash&lt;/a&gt;. Complications can include ear infections, lung infections, and, rarely, brain swelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious diseases, and is known to cause a dangerous and unique phenomenon called &lt;a href="https://asm.org/articles/2019/may/measles-and-immune-amnesia" target="_blank" title="https://asm.org/articles/2019/may/measles-and-immune-amnesia" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;"immune amnesia,&lt;/a&gt;" in which the infected patient's immune system goes through a reset, effectively "forgetting" any immunity it had towards other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to studies, in a room full of people exposed to measles,&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/02/14/measles-infection-virus-spread/https://www.statnews.com/2019/02/14/measles-infection-virus-spread/" target="_blank" title="https://www.statnews.com/2019/02/14/measles-infection-virus-spread/https://www.statnews.com/2019/02/14/measles-infection-virus-spread/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt; 90% who are unvaccinated &lt;/a&gt;will develop the disease. In addition, it can linger in the air for up to 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in healthy people, measles can cause the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 out of every 1,000 measles cases will develop acute encephalitis, which often results in permanent brain damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 to 3 out of every 1,000 children who become infected with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a rare but fatal degenerative disease of the central nervous system characterized by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Behavioral and intellectual deterioration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seizures that generally develop 7 to 10 years after measles infection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Oregonians have been vaccinated, significantly reducing their risk. However, unvaccinated individuals, especially pregnant people, infants under 1 year old, and those with weakened immune systems, are at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;three confirmed deaths from measles &lt;/a&gt;this year across the U.S. as of June 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials advise those experiencing symptoms not to visit medical offices unannounced. Instead, they should call ahead to arrange a safe entry plan to prevent exposing others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more&lt;a href="https://oregonhealthnews.oregon.gov/measles-what-you-should-know/?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank" title="https://oregonhealthnews.oregon.gov/measles-what-you-should-know/?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt; information on measles&lt;/a&gt;, visit the &lt;a href="https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/DISEASESCONDITIONS/DISEASESAZ/Pages/measles.aspx?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank" title="https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/DISEASESCONDITIONS/DISEASESAZ/Pages/measles.aspx?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Oregon Health Authority's website and blog.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KCBY</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 19:56:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogJBVV95cUxNZ0JtV2p5N2hFdkdTenJrNGd1NFV1UUFXSk1mVkdHNVVsY3JqTFh1Nkc3T3hrZ3h2MUswMHh1YkRObHJfSEJFd3V1cXRPWnVtTDNQSDV3TGdaOEJtYXV2QklOYkVnU1c4T2xEMC1hVWluWkVuakw3UlJDcHA5QlcyNDZNcXVNVXlQQ005cWU1d1NwSmxDNlNIREZnY1AxelFxWnI1YTRWWERfZFo0dHBLNGhfejVueG1rTTJVTnZjQnlIRExkSzN4bFB2Sm50eFFFVGljTzlxazN6d3BpdEJVN1hMLVo0Ti03SmpvNlRjRkNJVFd4dVp6blI1U21VU3dKVS1pSEpwVmwzOUowQ2V4cjNBMjlEWFI3dGRzNkVLbTc1dw</guid></item></channel></rss>
