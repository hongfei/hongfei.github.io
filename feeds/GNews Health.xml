&lt;p&gt;There’s a difference between a one-time boring assignment and a worrisome pattern of apathy. Notice changes about how you feel regarding work that you used to take satisfaction in doing, Garcia said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You might notice yourself just staring at your screen, pretending to be busy, or doing anything but tackling the big stuff,” Garcia said. “That loss of interest that depression can cause may have you thinking ‘I just don’t care’ about your work.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you can do next if you suspect you have depression.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these signs are resonating with your experience at work, know that you do not have to deal with depression on your own. There are steps you can take immediately to address how you are feeling and get better: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to what your body is telling you about your health. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your depression shows up as you hyper-functioning at work, it helps to check in with your body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can be easy to miss depressive symptoms when work is tricking you into feeling competent and self-efficacious,” Velez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why Velez suggests asking yourself questions that can help you notice changes in your physical health like: Are you feeling more tired than usual? What’s your relationship with alcohol or marijuana? Are you getting too little or too much sleep? How is your relationship with exercise and movement? Are there points of nagging tension anywhere in your body? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Physical signs and signals can alert you that it may be time to acknowledge those uncomfortable feelings,” Velez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk to loved ones and trusted peers about how you’re feeling. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you are depressed, you might not want anyone to know and may feel unworthy of your friends’ support. But in fact, talking to a few trusted peers and loved ones can be just what you need to help you against withdrawing and isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The best way to start managing depression is to talk with someone about it,” Howes said. He said you could open up to a friend or loved one, and let them know what you’re experiencing and how it’s impacting you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Velez said it can also help for employees experiencing depression to ask trusted colleagues to stop by their desk for a quick coffee chat a couple times a week or to check in with them via text. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek professional help. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Know that depression is very common and often responds well to treatment,” Howes said. “If it seems like this is depression, talking with a physician or a mental health professional is crucial. They will be able to assess your symptoms and recommend a course of treatment that may include therapy, medication or both.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With written documentation of your depression by a medical professional, you may also qualify for reasonable accommodations at your job under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act. Examples of these accommodations can include permission to work from home or an altered schedule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/depression-boss-work_l_64a5846ae4b0dcb22c48cb1a" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879795"&gt;you choose to share your condition with HR or your manager&lt;/a&gt;, they may be able to help you get company-sponsored resources and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many workplaces offer EAPs [Employee Assistance Programs] which have counselors on staff to provide short-term therapy or can also give the employee referrals for other services that may be needed such as child care, food and housing assistance, and therapists in the community,” Velez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assess whether your job is making your depression worse. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing psychiatrist Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9667129/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879795" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Aaron T. Beck&lt;/a&gt;’s research on cognitive behavioral therapy, Velez said it is also important to learn if your job is providing you with the ability to feel pleasure, or a sense of enjoyment, and mastery, or a sense of achievement, because those are factors people need in order to combat depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To monitor if your job is exacerbating symptoms or is the source of them, Velez said an employee can keep track of work activities for one or two weeks in a spreadsheet, with one column for “pleasure” and another column for “mastery.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having visual evidence can be a great way to confirm or deny our feelings,” Velez said. “Taking an inventory can let you know if you are getting pleasure and mastery from your job or if it’s time to start looking for a new job.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand that tiny wins do make a difference. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Depression often pushes you to isolate, do nothing, and be unkind to yourself. Doing the opposite, even in tiny ways, can really help,” Garcia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Garcia said that if you’re struggling to get out of bed and are showing up late to work, you can try sitting up when you wake instead of staying horizontal. And if projects feel overwhelming, Garcia recommended breaking them down into smaller steps or committing to just five minutes of focused effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it helps to understand that you are more than your depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“See depression as something separate from who you are and practice resisting its urges,” Garcia recommended. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point is to remember that depression can be a tough mental health condition that affects &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7224a1.htm" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879795" data-affiliate="true"&gt;millions of people every day&lt;/a&gt;, but it is a manageable one. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/depression-job-signs_l_65dcc2cde4b005b858310eac" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879795"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nami.org/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879795" data-affiliate="true"&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Alliance on Mental Illness&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; helpline is 1-888-950-6264 (NAMI) and provides information and referral services; &lt;a href="http://www.goodtherapy.org/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879795" data-affiliate="true"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GoodTherapy.org&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an association of mental health professionals from more than 25 countries who support efforts to reduce harm in therapy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A second case of measles has been confirmed in Virginia this year, health officials said on Friday. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Virginia Department of Health said it was a teenager from the northwest region of the state who had recently traveled outside the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials released the following locations and times of when and where the teen could have exposed others:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charlottesville Albemarle Airport between 2:15 and 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play it Again Sports store on 1885 Seminole Trail in Charlottesville between 2:40 and 5 p.m. on Tuesday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goodwill Store and Donation Center on 440 Gander Drive in Charlottesville between 3:10 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UVA Health Primary Care Riverside clinic on 2335 Seminole Lane, Suite 200 in Charlottesville, from 2 to 7:10 p.m. on Thursday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UVA Health University Medical Center Emergency Department on 1215 Lee Street in Charlottesville between midnight and 6 a.m. on Friday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/virginia/2025/04/virginia-department-of-health-warns-of-potential-measles-exposure-in-woodbridge-fredericksburg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the first measles case was reported in Virginia&lt;/a&gt; — a child under 4 years old who possibly exposed other people in clinics in Fredericksburg and Woodbridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/blog/2025/05/23/virginia-health-officials-confirm-second-2025-measles-case-in-the-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Virginia Department of Health&lt;/a&gt; said, “measles is a highly contagious illness that can spread easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should contact your health care provider immediately if you have symptoms of measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information about how to protect yourself from this disease, go to the &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/measles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;state’s health department website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday that there are 1,046 confirmed measles cases, up 22 from last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c"&gt;Texas, where the nation’s biggest outbreak raged during the late winter and spring, confirmed only 10&lt;/a&gt; more cases this past week for a total of 728.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three other &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-mexico-canada-ontario-0956a30c043b030ae79bc9f67c6ce89c"&gt;major outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; in North America. One in Ontario, Canada, has resulted in &lt;a href="https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/Documents/M/24/measles-ontario-epi-summary.pdf?rev=323859266e21469b8b97a294d6c6f98e&amp;amp;sc_lang=en"&gt;1,795 cases&lt;/a&gt; from mid-October through May 20, an increase of 173 cases in a week. Another in Alberta, Canada, has sickened &lt;a href="https://www.alberta.ca/measles"&gt;538 as of Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.

						Health officials in Provincetown, Massachusetts, issued a warning of potential exposure to hepatitis A on Saturday, after a food service worker was infected with the virus.In a statement, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH), Barnstable County Department of Health and Environment and the Provincetown Board of Health warned anyone who dined at The Red Inn at 15 Commercial St. in Provincetown between April 30 and May 15, that they may have been exposed to hepatitis A and should contact their healthcare provider.According to the DPH statement, the food service worker at the restaurant who worked during those dates has a confirmed infection with the hepatitis A virus.As hepatitis A is highly contagious, the DPH urged customers who may have been exposed to the virus to contact their health care provider immediately to receive appropriate medical treatment.The DPH said preventive measures against the hepatitis A virus include the hepatitis A vaccine and hepatitis A immune globulin.However, the DPH said these are generally only effective at preventing hepatitis A infection if given within two weeks of exposure, prior to symptom onset.The DPH said early signs and symptoms of hepatitis A include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and jaundice (dark urine, yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes). Hepatitis A typically varies in severity, with mild cases lasting two weeks or less and more severe cases lasting four to six weeks or longer.Additionally, the DPH said some people, particularly children, may not develop jaundice and may have an illness so mild that it can go unnoticed.However, the DPH said even mildly sick people can still be highly infectious, and people who become sick with hepatitis-like symptoms should consult a health care provider, even if the symptoms are mild.Hepatitis A can be spread between people through food handling, and the DPH said it can be spread by contaminated food and beverages. The DPH advises customers who dine at The Red Inn between April 30 and May 15 to practice thorough handwashing, especially before preparing food, to avoid any potential further spread of the virus.

Not every man has 75 children across Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She continued: “I analysed the variant using population and patient databases, computer prediction tools and the results of functional trials, and came to the conclusion that the variant was probably cancer-causing and that children born from this donor should receive genetic counselling.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children who have been shown to have the gene are advised to have whole-body and brain MRI scans. They are also recommended to have breast and abdomen ultrasounds as adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie Paulli Budtz, a spokesperson for the European Sperm Bank, told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;: “We are deeply affected by this case.” She said the donor had been thoroughly tested but that “it is scientifically simply not possible to detect disease-causing mutations in a person’s gene pool if you don’t know what you are looking for”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added: “We welcome continued dialogue on setting an internationally mandated family limit, and have advocated for this on several occasions. This is also why we have proactively implemented our own international limit of 75 families per donor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 18:24:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOMS04Ym9BUjJMNDFTcE1NUjFsWGk3UTZBY19HOHZsWEg1eGYyek1JM1lJcnhHaUx4V3JwNTJySXBIbXNNV3hzSXdVUVcwYWR4U1FaaEdmdkFiUzEwYmtXdjk2VVFkcVFrUGE5TW5yZ2RTcW5fblBXcW10ZU1qaWJUVnRaeXcyM2NibWJORVNwdjlLRXM2eGgwd3NhdTQ</guid></item><item><title>Caturday Pootie日记：夏天来了- Daily Kos | Caturday Pootie Diary: Summer is coming - Daily Kos</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQbDFaR3JjQWtZMDgtUzU0Y2pxUW1tblRjZy12ekFSWmF1cnZRZExLeFljek9QM0x0QjFpVzRGaVh6Y2t1d0tvRWdsbVJsLU9BMTE4cEJMSC1wVlo3S0JaaTJPT1p5Mlh3d2lSbjdiNWJOdzNucGdwcUNyZlJGZVNrbU9qVW9ueGI0MERZNno5aTFFMUxM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story__text"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;I shook my head at the cat staring hopefully up at me. “You can’t have any,” I said, taking a bite of my sandwich. “You’re diabetic and your mouth is still healing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Surely I can have one little bite,” he argued. “One little bite won’t hurt.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It might so we aren’t taking the chance,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sighed, and turned his back on me to lie down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A gentle reminder of how we do things:  &lt;/em&gt;🐱🐶🐦&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are some pics we never post:  &lt;/strong&gt;snakes, creepy crawlies, &lt;em&gt;any and all photos that depict or encourage human cruelty toward animals.&lt;/em&gt;  These are considered “out of bounds” and will not be tolerated.  If we alert you to it, please remember that we do have phobic peeps who react strongly to them.  If you keep posting banned pics...well then...the Tigress will have to take matters in hand.  Or, paw.I snatched an apple out of the bowl on the kitchen island and dropped it into the lunch bag, then satisfied that I had enough to eat for the day, I zipped it closed. The microwave signaled that the egg was done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




          &lt;p class="story-intro-divider"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          
&lt;p&gt;He stood and stretched (“Oooh, goooooooood streeeeeeeetch!”) then turned toward me and placed a paw on my lap. “I could lie on the furry blanket?” he said, hopefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s so hot,” I whined. “I’m sorry, I can’t.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You aren’t fun anymore,” he huffed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Spring is not my fault.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m getting fewer treats — “&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They’re crunchy and your mouth is still healing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s no kibble — “&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You can only have soft food for just a few more days.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You keep shooting that terrible stuff down my throat!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I winced at that. The day after his procedure, his cheeks had swelled up a bit and the vet gave us some antibiotics for him just to prevent any infection that might be brewing from taking hold. The liquid was thick, and brown, and decidedly sludge-like. “I’m sorry about that. Only a few more days.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You keep taking me to the vet! You left me there &lt;em&gt;all day&lt;/em&gt;!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That was to help you!” I defended myself. “And as long as your healing keeps going well you won’t have to go back for a while.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You should be nicer to me,” he said, darkly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My credit card is being very nice to you,” I shot back, then immediately regretted it. That wasn’t his fault. “I don’t mean that,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t even know what that means,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sighed, and petted him in attempt to defuse the situation. “It’s been a rough few weeks,” I commiserated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It really has,” he agreed, settling down again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t worry. This will be a good summer. Your mouth is going to feel so much better. No more pain!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That will be pretty good,” he grudgingly agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I frowned down at him. “I wish you would tell me when you were hurting.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I can’t do that!” he said, scandalized. “What about the predators!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I smiled. “You’re an indoor cat,” I reminded him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What do you want to do this summer?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sleep,” he said, immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Of course,” I said. “That’s the best way to beat the heat.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I like to eat, too,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These are all things you do all the time,” I pointed out. “Is there anything you want to do just for summer?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He thought about it. “Keep to myself and not be near any humans.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I laughed. “Yeah, that is your favorite summer activity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"Are you going to spend time in the weird big water dish?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nodded. “Probably a lot of time,” I said. “You could go swimming with me. I bet you can do it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He recoiled a little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Or not!” I said, quickly. “I’d never force you!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Human, the ducks go in there,” he said with exaggerated patience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes, but I’m not afraid of them. And they don’t go in the backyard when I’m out there. I scare them away.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sat in silence for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They poop in there,” he said, quietly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was my turn to recoil.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I was partially asleep when I felt Freddie get up. He wasn’t trying to hard to keep me from waking up, walking over my lap without grace or gentleness. “Ouch,” I murmured, opening my eyes. “Where are you going?” I asked as he jumped to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m going to get a head start on Summer,” he said, over his shoulder as he left the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s time to ignore me?” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s time to ignore you,” he confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Caturday, Peeps! On Sunday night Freddie had some swelling in his cheeks and I called the vet (they are a 24/7 eVet as well as a regular clinic so someone is always there). I really thought it was a normal reaction but I just wanted to make sure. They told me it was not, in fact, a normal reaction and that I should bring him in. Since he was eating and not having trouble breathing, they made me an appointment with his regular vet for the next morning instead of recommending I bring him in that night. The swelling was better in the morning, but I still kept the appointment. His lungs were clear and he didn’t seem to be in any extra pain, so the vet just gave us some antibiotics to take home and instructed me to come back if the problem didn’t improve or got worse. He said that diabetes can sometimes complicate healing. By the next day, the swelling was gone altogether so I don’t think we’ll have to go back. He does seem to be doing pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;

Here’s what you should know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What’s Safe?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;For most adults and children ages 12 years and older, the recommended OTC dose of ibuprofen is one (or two, if needed) 200-milligram tablets, caplets or gel caplets every four to six hours while symptoms persist. You shouldn’t take more than 1,200 mg (or six pills) in a 24-hour period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you haven’t consulted a doctor about how much is safe, or if you aren’t certain about your risk factors, it’s best not to exceed the recommended limit of 1,200 milligrams a day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have chronic pain, or were recently injured or had surgery, your doctor may prescribe ibuprofen for you at a higher dose. Prescription tablets are usually stronger compared to the OTC dose, such as 600 mg and 800 mg. The maximum daily dose for prescription-strength ibuprofen is 3,200 mg in a 24-hour period. But it’s important only to take what your provider has prescribed for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also be aware that ibuprofen is sometimes added to certain cold and flu medications, so always read the ingredient list on medications before using them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Be Cautious!&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ibuprofen belongs to a class of drugs known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, which reduce pain and inflammation by blocking the activity of certain enzymes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But these enzymes also help maintain kidney and liver function and regulate the balance of fluids and electrolytes in your body. So, taking ibuprofen can be dangerous for patients with kidney disease or failure; those with liver damage or cirrhosis; and people with conditions that put strain on their kidneys, like high blood pressure or heart failure. Those at high risk for these conditions – as well as for stomach ulcers, heart attacks, strokes or bleeding problems – should talk with their doctors before taking ibuprofen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People who take medications such as diuretics, anticoagulants, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers) to manage cardiovascular issues should also be careful, because ibuprofen stresses the kidneys and the heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To reduce these health risks, don’t take the maximum recommended dose for more than a week or two at a time. If you are needing it for more than two weeks, or if you’re turning to ibuprofen every day to keep your aches and pains in check, you need to see your doctor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When taken for long periods, ibuprofen can also increase the risk of stomach ulcers. The drug inhibits enzymes that, among other things, aid in the production of mucus that lines and protects the stomach lining, so without these enzymes, the stomach becomes vulnerable to irritation and damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some alternatives to ibuprofen you should talk to your doctor about include acetaminophen (Tylenol), topical NSAIDs (diclofenac gel) that is not absorbed into the blood to the same extent as oral NSAIDs, nonacetylated salicylates, curcumin (an active ingredient in turmeric) and acupuncture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Send your questions or comments to questions@savvysenior.org, or to Savvy Senior, P.O.

Researchers observed that healthy spouses of partners with insomnia, depression, and anxiety developed similar mental health symptoms and microbiota profiles within six months of marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found strong correlations between shared bacterial strains, altered cortisol levels, and increased depression and anxiety scores. While the findings are not yet causal, they highlight a possible microbial route for emotional contagion between intimate partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microbial Convergence:&lt;/strong&gt; Spouses’ oral microbiomes became more similar over time, particularly when one partner had depression and anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mood Correlation:&lt;/strong&gt; Changes in microbiota composition correlated with increased salivary cortisol and worsening mental health in the healthy partner.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Bacteria Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher levels of Clostridia, Veillonella, Bacillus, and Lachnospiraceae were linked to the depression-anxiety phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Xia &amp;amp; He Publishing Inc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oral microbiota dysbiosis and altered salivary cortisol levels have been linked to depression and anxiety. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that bacterial transmission can occur between spouses, this study aimed to investigate whether the transmission of oral microbiota between newlywed couples mediates symptoms of depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Validated Persian versions of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and Beck Anxiety Inventory were administered to 1,740 couples who had been married for six months. The researchers compared 268 healthy control spouses with 268 affected cases in a cross-sectional study. Data were analyzed using appropriate statistical methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After six months, healthy spouses married to an insomniac with the depression-anxiety (DA) phenotype scored significantly higher on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and Beck Anxiety Inventory compared to their baseline scores. This indicates that their sleep quality, depression, and anxiety scores became more similar to those of their affected spouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the composition of their oral microbiota changed significantly, becoming increasingly similar to that of their spouses. Specifically, in couples where one partner had the DA phenotype, the oral microbiota of the healthy spouse mirrored that of the affected partner (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These microbial changes correlated with alterations in salivary cortisol levels as well as depression and anxiety scores. Linear discriminant analysis revealed that the relative abundances of &lt;em&gt;Clostridia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Veillonella&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bacillus&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Lachnospiraceae&lt;/em&gt; were significantly higher in insomniacs with the DA phenotype compared to healthy controls (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transmission of oral microbiota plays a partial role in mediating depression and anxiety among couples. Since this study is associational, further research is needed to establish whether this association is causal. If it is determined that this association is indeed causal, it could have significant implications for contemporary research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We propose that, within the framework of diagnostic, predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine, the practical and theoretical implications of this study may enhance our understanding of various aspects of microbiota-host interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this microbiome and mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#097a6c7b7f606a6c49716068616c797c6b65607a6160676e276a6664" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Shelly Zhang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://xiahepublishing.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Xia &amp;amp; He Publishing Inc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Shelly Zhang – Xia &amp;amp; He Publishing Inc&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.14218/ERHM.2025.00013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Oral Microbiota Transmission Partially Mediates Depression and Anxiety in Newlywed Couples&lt;/a&gt;” by Neil Daghnall et al. &lt;em&gt;Exploratory Research and Hypothesis in Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p id="p21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 14:59:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9XaThDUEtuZGVHVlQ4M2JyWG1Ba0dFRk41bnlhN3lpbVVEZjVldWFHZFlXNWM4RG0yM2dvbUtWQnFKdWVfOHJiRC0tTFVJTklRRHVDbHpKR2VZZGNrV19MLUlQME1fU0Jwd0N6bHpPeFRVUnVkd1VNVk4xQQ</guid></item><item><title>这是您不想忘记清洗的身体部位： “总是捕捉污垢” -《纽约邮报》 | This is the one body part you don’t want to forget to wash: ‘Always traps grime’ - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxPSllFZTJiRC1aVmRrVjl1NzM1eWxkQVFhQ3dyblg5ZlZ3SUFMSlRLQXBuWmwxQUJPQ1hISmoxYnY4d3hyRU9ybFU2YmV4LUZjZWJoRVBYVDhaSGY0U2dRampKdkM3OHIwS3g4VEZ6ZHJEUUdESXE1bThJQ2dPVmVnMy05NjlBZ3AybUp3NnQyUXlhOUZBNEo1YXFQMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;You might be rinsing and repeating — but you’re probably not as clean as you think.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dermatologists say there’s one spot most people overlook in their shower routine where dirt, oil and dead skin cells can accumulate quickly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Left unchecked, that buildup can lead to bacterial infections, painful skin problems and a foul odor that lingers long after you’ve toweled off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Studies show roughly two-thirds of Americans shower daily.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Daria – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/how-to-clean-your-ear"&gt;generally agree&lt;/a&gt; that your ears do a good job of cleaning themselves, so you can probably toss the Q-tips. But the area around them is a different story. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I always recommend people wash the skin behind their ears intentionally and specifically to get into the creases of where the ear meets your skin, as it can always trap grime,” &lt;a href="https://www.beloithealthsystem.org/find-a-provider/roger-kapoor-m-d-m-b-a-f-a-a-d-/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Roger Kapoor&lt;/a&gt;, a dermatologist and senior vice president at Beloit Memorial Hospital, &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/most-people-forget-to-wash-this-body-part" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told Parade&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;That’s especially true in summer, when sweat and sunscreen create a moist breeding ground for bacteria and fungus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For people who wear glasses, the arms resting behind the ears can also easily transfer bacteria to the skin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Ear-itation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Oil, dirt, and dead skin cells piling up behind your ears can clog pores and cause painful pimples and acne.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It can also irritate your skin — and even trigger &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/eczema/what-to-know-about-ear-eczema" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ear eczema&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ear eczema symptoms range from hardly noticeable to extremely uncomfortable.

 &lt;span class="credit"&gt;artem_goncharov – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This inflammatory skin condition causes red, itchy patches that can be dry, flaky or waxy, depending on the type.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Any inflammatory condition of the skin can lead to cracks in the natural skin barrier, allowing bacteria in and causing infections,” Dr. &lt;a href="https://stcharlesdermatologicsurgery.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Stacey Tull&lt;/a&gt;, a dermatologist and micrographic dermatologic surgeon, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-to-wash-dirtiest-body-parts-in-shower-study-8384889"&gt;told Real Simple&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even tiny cuts, piercings or scratches inside the ear can open the door to infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In rare but serious cases, those infections can spread beyond the ear and into the bloodstream — potentially leading to life-threatening sepsis, when the body starts attacking its own organs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What’s that smell?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Infections behind the ears can also give off a foul, cheeselike stench, often thanks to bacteria, yeast and fungi, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/smell-behind-ears#causes"&gt;according to Healthline&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Possible causes of a smell behind the ear include poor hygiene and infections.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Krakenimages.com – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sweat gland behind the ears also secrete perspiration starts to stink once it mixes with bacteria and oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add sebaceous glands, which secrete a waxy mix of oils and fats, and you’ve got a recipe for some serious funk if it builds up. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem can be even worse for people with overactive glands that release extra sweat and oil.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Wash up — and when to get help&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If an infection is painful, you have a fever, swollen lymph nodes or home treatments like over-the-counter antifungal creams don’t work, it’s probably time to see a doctor, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325081#prevention" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt; reports. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some infections need stronger antibiotics to clear up and prevent serious complications. Doctors can also prescribe anti-inflammatory ointments to soothe eczema symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Doctors can help diagnose pain behind the ear and recommend various treatments.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;bnenin – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, the area behind your ears is simple to clean. All you need is gentle soap and warm water.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trickiest part is probably remembering to scrub the area after hitting all the usual spots in the shower.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kapoor says shampoo can help break down oil and bacteria behind your ears, but it rinses off quickly unless you specifically scrub the area.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you wear glasses, he also recommends cleaning the arms regularly to keep bacteria from transferring to your skin.&lt;/p&gt;

Mariya Borisova/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study suggests that vitamin D supplementation may help preserve the lengths of the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes known as telomeres.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers say maintaining the length of telomeres may help slow some aspects of biological aging.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Telomere length is an important component of healthy aging, but the role vitamin D can play isn’t yet certain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study reports that vitamin D supplementation may help slow some of the mechanisms of biological aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That shortening is a natural part of aging, but it has been linked to certain age-related diseases. Among those diseases are cancer of the bladder, lungs, kidneys, and gastrointestinal systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that targeted vitamin D supplementation may be a promising strategy to counter a biological aging process, although further research is warranted,” said &lt;a href="https://www.augusta.edu/institutes/gpi/gpi-faculty/zhu.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Haidong Zhu&lt;/a&gt;, MD, PhD, the first author of the study and a molecular geneticist at the Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University, in a &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/vitamin-d-supplements-show-signs-of-protection-against-biological-aging" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts agree the new research is interesting, but they note it has its limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Telomere length was protected with vitamin D supplementation, but it’s not clear how that translates to real life biological aging,” &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/marilyn-tan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Marilyn Tan&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a clinical associate professor of medicine at Stanford University in California, told Healthline. Tan wasn’t involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The present study involved only a relatively small number of people, looked only at telomeres in white blood cells, and did not look extensively at the health impact of these telomere changes,” added &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/family-medicine/ca/santa-monica/david-cutler-1255368338" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;David Cutler&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, California. “So, the clinical implications one can derive from this study are quite limited.” Cutler was likewise not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers based their findings on the results of the &lt;a href="https://www.vitalstudy.org/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;VITAL&lt;/a&gt; randomized controlled clinical trial, which was overseen by Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their study, the researchers tracked 1,054 participants to see if vitamin D and &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-are-omega-3-fatty-acids" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; can lessen telomere shortening and slow biological aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study group included females ages 55 and older and males ages 50 and older. The researchers followed the participants for five years, measuring telomere length in white blood cells at baseline, year two, and year four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers reported that omega-3 fatty acids had no significant effect on telomere length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, they said vitamin D3 supplements significantly reduced telomere shortening and prevented the equivalent of nearly three years of aging in people who took vitamin D in comparison to people who were given a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say such a slowdown in the aging process has important benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Slowing biological aging may improve life expectancy and quality of life, and it could reduce the risk of various disease states,” Tan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health benefits of vitamin D have been touted over recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/vitamin-d-recommendations-insufficient-heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; has also indicated that a sufficient amount of vitamin D may help improve heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s estimated that &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532266/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;35% of people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; in the United States have a deficiency of vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;hl-trusted-source source="National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements" rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;current recommendation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; for daily vitamin D consumption is 400 to 800 international units for most healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-d-dosage#deficiency" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; is known as the “sunshine vitamin” because the best source for it is sunlight. Your body makes dietary vitamin D3 out of the cholesterol in the skin when it is exposed to the sun’s UV rays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-d-from-sun#time-of-day" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;best time&lt;/a&gt; to get the most of this beneficial sunlight is noon, when the sun is at its peak. However, experts say that too much sunlight can cause sunburns, eye damage, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/heat-stroke" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;heatstroke&lt;/a&gt;, and skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There aren’t a lot of foods that are sufficient sources of vitamin D, but there are a few.

To know exactly how much vitamin D supplementation one needs, you should discuss with your healthcare provider.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutler said people with healthy vitamin D levels probably don’t need supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There have been many studies involving tens of thousands of people seeking to document [the] benefits of vitamin D in healthy adults with normal vitamin D levels, and no benefits have been found,” Cutler told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There has been no documentation of reduced cancer rates, less &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-disease" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, increased longevity, protection from infection, or improved outcomes from &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-d-coronavirus" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;COVID&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The best-supported strategies to preserve telomere length are &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/benefits-of-aerobic-exercise" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;, diet, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/stress-coping-eliminate" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;stress management&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sleep" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;adequate sleep&lt;/a&gt;, and avoiding harmful substances like &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/smoking/effects-on-body" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;tobacco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/alcohol/effects-on-body" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;,” he added. “These lifestyle changes don’t just preserve telomeres — they also broadly support healthy aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Healthline</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 14:23:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOOVktSjE5ZWN5VHRSRkdGYjl2c196ZG1pNWpWclBfcTJNbzF6VUZuc0xRNS1nbmpLT0hLMjl1NVB5bjhJWDRGamoxV2d4NW9meUd3UWRadnFOV3lfNjFFSW05YzU5V1BWTi1zOGdBRlhIdEtER2NpbXpydjBpWmFZSHNyY18weWZfMnVFT2pscw</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，超过十分之一的老年兽医使用大麻-《华盛顿邮报》 | More than 1 in 10 older vets uses cannabis, study finds - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxQSFU4dEhaVmN3amQ0QXJDOWlBeUtQU1lfWXZBeTdseWJxU1hfYVhSNE9WRHZ3TXp1blo1OHpKbWFlYVNqWGsyZGh6cXAwZEVFYlBmVnBvN25QZmtxQVFnSVdEeTlSS0ptQ25zbE5SN09nLTNGanQ0aUtkSXZwdWVWSWFqbmN1ajJZOXJBbA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2DLXIEOHSZG5JGHJTEXTA3WMYE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;More than 1 in 10 veterans ages 65 to 84 used cannabis in the previous month, a new &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.10173" target="_blank"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) data published in JAMA Network Open suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3RMBDDVIMRGDNCZGUWYCYOV63A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To learn more about cannabis use in older adults, researchers turned to the Veterans Affairs Cannabis and Aging Study, which follows a national cohort of veterans and their cannabis use.

However, its effects typically last only a week, and frequent dosing poses risks like dissociation or addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study demonstrates that ketamine’s benefits can be extended up to two months by using a compound that enhances ERK signaling, a pathway essential to ketamine’s long-term action. This breakthrough offers a proof of principle for safer, more sustained depression treatment strategies targeting intracellular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid-Acting Relief:&lt;/strong&gt; Ketamine alleviates depression symptoms within hours, even in resistant patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extended Efficacy:&lt;/strong&gt; A compound called BCI prolonged ketamine’s antidepressant effect up to two months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanism-Based Strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; Enhancing ERK signaling may help sustain antidepressant effects from a single dose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Vanderbilt University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roughly 10 percent of the U.S. population is afflicted with major depressive disorder at any given time, and up to 20 percent will exhibit MDD symptoms over their lifetimes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet despite its prevalence, methods to treat MDD often fall short for a not-insignificant portion of the population. Antidepressants—the standard of treatment—don’t work for 30 percent with MDD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When infused at a low dose ketamine shows remarkable efficacy as a rapidly acting antidepressant, with effects observed within hours even in patients who have been resistant to other antidepressant treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110354"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;By inhibiting the phosphatase, the authors retained ERK’s activity and augmented the synaptic plasticity that drives ketamine’s prolonged antidepressant effects. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, consistent infusions of ketamine are needed to maintain symptoms at bay, which could result in side effects, such as dissociative behaviors and the possibility of addiction, and stopping treatment can result in relapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study published in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, Lisa Monteggia’s and Ege Kavalali’s labs show that it is feasible to substantially extend the efficacy of a single dose of ketamine from its current duration of up to a week to a longer period of up to two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “The premise of this study, which was led by Zhenzhong Ma, a fantastic research assistant professor, was based on a testable mechanistic model that we developed that accounts for ketamine’s rapid antidepressant action,” Monteggia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monteggia holds the Lee E. Limbird Chair in Pharmacology and is the Barlow Family Director of the Vanderbilt Brain Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, researchers in the field had determined that ketamine’s antidepressant effect requires the activation of a key signaling pathway called ERK, but only ketamine’s long-term effects—not its rapid effects—are abolished when ERK is inhibited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a fast-acting antidepressant, ketamine relies on ERK-dependent synaptic plasticity to produce its rapid behavioral effects. Ma and colleagues hypothesized that they could maintain ketamine’s effects for longer periods by enhancing ERK activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the recent paper, Ma discovered that ketamine’s antidepressant effects could be sustained for up to two months by using a drug called BCI, which inhibits a protein phosphatase and results in increased ERK activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By inhibiting the phosphatase, the authors retained ERK’s activity and augmented the synaptic plasticity that drives ketamine’s prolonged antidepressant effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the use of BCI make the application of these results to the clinic difficult, Monteggia said that the results provide a proof of principle that ketamine’s antidepressant action can be sustained by targeting intracellular signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and Kavalali, the William Stokes Professor of Experimental Therapeutics and the chair of the Department of Pharmacology, have worked on the project since its inception and hope that it fosters other studies looking to identify specific molecules that will enhance and sustain the action of a single dose of ketamine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this work will be a steppingstone toward improving MDD patients’ lives by reducing the burden of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopharmacology and depression research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#afc2ceddc6dcdcce81dcc7cedfc6ddc0efd9cec1cbcaddcdc6c3db81cacbda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Marissa Shapiro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://vanderbilt.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Vanderbilt University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Marissa Shapiro – Vanderbilt University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.abb6748" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Enhanced ERK activity extends ketamine’s antidepressant effects by augmenting synaptic plasticity&lt;/a&gt;” by Lisa Monteggia et al. &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced ERK activity extends ketamine’s antidepressant effects by augmenting synaptic plasticity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeated ketamine treatment to maintain a rapid antidepressant effect can lead to side effects over time, highlighting an unmet clinical need for sustaining this drug’s antidepressant action from a single administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ketamine-induced synaptic potentiation at CA3-CA1 synapses has been proposed to be a key synaptic substrate for antidepressant action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we found that ketamine-induced CA3-CA1 synaptic potentiation could be augmented by transiently increasing extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) activity through pharmacological inhibition of dual-specificity phosphatases 6 (DUSP6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antidepressant-like behavioral effects of acute ketamine treatment were extended by DUSP6 inhibition for up to 2 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The selective deletion of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) in excitatory neurons abolished these DUSP6 inhibition–mediated synaptic and behavioral effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These data suggest that ketamine’s rapid antidepressant effects can be sustained by selectively targeting downstream intracellular signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

All true,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“None of that is true,” Murphy responded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Of course it’s true,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Statements like these undermine the public’s confidence in vaccines at a critical time, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Communities that have fallen below the 95% threshold for community immunity (also known as herd immunity) should run vaccination campaigns now, before new outbreaks begin, both Wells and Maresso said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The easiest thing you can do, in this case, is just put out an educational campaign around closing the vaccine gap,” said Maresso. “If we had vaccine coverage above 95%, we would not see these outbreaks. It’s that effective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Wells added that “what we’ve learned here is that there’s a lot of communities across the US that have these lower vaccination rates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Summer tends to be a high season for travel, and travelers may import measles from a state or country experiencing an outbreak into at-risk communities like these, Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;If we had vaccine coverage above 95%, we would not see these outbreaks.

You’re probably not seeing them on the clinical radar, but there are cases in your community, and you should expect that you’re going to start to see cases – and if they’re not vaccinated, it’s going to get worse.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Local leaders should prepare for measles outbreaks now, Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c208955f-49ef-41ba-8036-afb4febc76e4" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":33,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Measles outbreak: how contagious is it and what are the symptoms?","elementId":"c208955f-49ef-41ba-8036-afb4febc76e4","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/02/measles-symptoms-vaccine-outbreak"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Some of it’s education to your physicians, your schools, your daycares, about measles, what the rash looks like, just so that people are paying attention to that,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Public health officials should also understand their testing capabilities and the logistics of, for instance, transporting specimens to laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;That way, “you’re prepared and it’s at the front of your mind – not sitting back in some dusty textbook,” Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But all of that work requires funding. While public health departments have frequently worked on shoestring budgets, the Trump administration has made funding even more precarious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There was a clawback of the Covid funding that was available to local health departments,” Wells said. And with other federal funds for public health, “it’s even harder to follow exactly what’s going on,” Wells noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I’m concerned. It’s so important for us to have local public health departments that can respond to things like measles or whatever the next outbreak is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE4yTEN3Nm1VQ1JWMDdpNFV2WXFHdDVDZlpGemhIQ3lvRmxyQWhrWDhCdVBpdzkyMGZGbmR5M2NKdTJNd3l3RmpKQjBkNUtqQS1vNGZzMUk4TXFsMjF2aUJMcnJUcGVxVnJsSmRTeU5YdVZwT0dxM28yOTF3</guid></item><item><title>根据胃肠病学家的说法，最简单的高纤维交换可以改善肠道健康- EatingWell | The Easiest High-Fiber Swap for Better Gut Health, According to a Gastroenterologist - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE01QWN1Y0c4XzdLeTZrV0dDb05BQU9IZHRGb3h4b3FNeE8zWTFjTG9scjVNdloyTl8teHNZUzJMT2VnSlFEYkZHdEpyNEY0LThxbWtLWERkZnVpNFFtQzBzcEJHSmg5a3h4cThGZVFKaE9oMlhQQ0JhTHZQRHlTaE0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A gastroenterologist suggests swapping white bread for sprouted grain or whole wheat bread.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;White bread is made with refined grains, which can cause blood sugar spikes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sprouted grain and whole wheat bread are gut-healthy options that can support heart health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At &lt;em&gt;EatingWell&lt;/em&gt;, we believe that any food can be enjoyed in a healthy eating pattern. Sometimes this means having less nutritious foods in moderation rather than completely cutting them out of your diet. And it could also mean swapping some of your go-tos with similar, healthier versions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In a recent Instagram video, gastroenterologist &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/fact-or-fiction-gastroenterologist-on-gut-health-myths-8726665" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Will Bulsiewicz, M.D., MSCI&lt;/a&gt;, shared an easy swap that you can make for your breakfast or lunch. If you’re a toast lover or sandwich fan, this is for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It’s time to rethink your bread, because there’s a high probability that your pantry has white bread, which is made from refined grains,” Bulsiewicz says. He then explains why eating refined grains isn’t the best option for your gut health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “When they refine the grains, they’re stripping away the fiber, the vitamins, the minerals, all the good stuff,” he shares. “Throwing that in the trash, and they’re leaving you with the stuff that’s going to spike your blood sugar.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There is recent science that shows a diet high in ultra-processed foods and refined carbs can increase your risk for gut and heart problems.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; On the flip side, research suggests that focusing on whole grains can help reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s why Bulsiewicz recommends swapping out white bread for sprouted grain or whole-wheat bread.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “This type of whole grain bread means more fiber, slower digestion, better blood sugar control plus the whole grains have antioxidants and phytonutrients that are wonderful for you and have anti-inflammatory properties,” Bulsiewicz explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7897382/im-a-dietitian-and-this-is-my-favorite-healthy-bread/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Dietitians agree&lt;/a&gt; that sprouted grain bread is a favorite; it’s a satisfying choice for being rich in fiber and protein. Brands like Food for Life and Dave’s Killer Bread sell delicious sprouted grain bread in the same aisle as your other favorite loaves.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s important to note that if you’re a fan of white bread, it’s totally OK to have it when you’re in the mood for it. But if you’re a daily bread eater, swapping for a more nutrient-rich option is a smart choice. Choose whole-wheat or sprouted grain when making a high-protein &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8046558/best-tuna-salad-recipe/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;tuna salad sandwich&lt;/a&gt;, or when you’re enjoying toast with jam or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-peanut-butter-good-for-you-8638482" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;peanut butter&lt;/a&gt;.

SCPD and other health organizations are working to identify as many people as possible who could have had contact with the patient. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, Idaho’s state epidemiologists will contact the individual’s area of residence to inform them about the case and “collaborate on the investigation since it is possible that people in both areas may have been exposed,” Dillon told the Idaho Statesman in an email. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since the case came from someone who lives out of state, it is technically not considered an Idaho case, but an incidence of measles exposure, Dillon also said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CDC characterizes measles by myriad symptoms that can show up anywhere from one to two weeks after exposure:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;High fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes are the first signs.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Symptoms 2-3 days after onset: Tiny white spots (Koplik spots) may appear inside the mouth.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Symptoms 3-5 days after onset: The measles rash will appear, usually beginning as flat red spots on the face at the hairline, later spreading to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We are focused on working with state and local health organizations in this ongoing investigation,” Tanis Maxwell, SCPHD Family and Children’s Health director, stated in the release. “Our priority is to keep the public informed and to support anyone who may have been exposed. If you are concerned about measles, it’s important to take preventive steps and be aware of any symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those who are experiencing symptoms are encouraged to contact their health care provider but should try not to go to clinics, pharmacies or other settings without calling ahead. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A preliminary investigation revealed that the individual received the measles vaccine in childhood, making the incident a rare breakthrough case. Despite these cases, the measles vaccine is still considered to be the “best protection” against the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two-dose measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is widely available. The first dose is recommended for children between the ages of 12 months to 15 months, and the second dose between the ages of 4-6. Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective and one dose is 93% effective at preventing measles, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Friday’s announcement came after Idaho &lt;a href="https://healthandwelfare.idaho.gov/dhw-voice/thinking-ahead-about-possibility-measles-idaho" data-mrf-link="https://healthandwelfare.idaho.gov/dhw-voice/thinking-ahead-about-possibility-measles-idaho" cmp-ltrk="Story body links" cmp-ltrk-idx="2" mrfobservableid="39a90864-cb27-4416-a98b-e18b13598134"&gt;state epidemiologist Dr. Christine Hahn&lt;/a&gt; expressed concern in an April 28 statement that although Idaho had no cases yet in 2025, that could change as the summer arrives. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyone with questions about measles or the MMR vaccine are encouraged to contact their primary care provider or call SCPHD at (208) 737-1138.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>East Idaho News</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNbVhoOHJnQXpIa3Q3MjVyc3RLS0Jtal9nX3NIRmNnMUlSRnBqaDB5TWxkN3hKb3hjWURQUzQ0YUl6YjV5QzhrM1RLRGp6OUkzUlFkV28wVkNqRGdvV293b2Z1TC1UQmFGY2lQbWN1bjRoVEQySTVDV21OYTJld01iNnMybzZTOWM5RDgzWTNyVmlqS2lRaFFXUGJ3M0p4OHpORzZoUldNT0ZEaTJ6SGlF</guid></item><item><title>智能牙线测量压力荷尔蒙，便于实时监测-神经科学新闻 | Smart Floss Measures Stress Hormone for Easy, Real-Time Monitoring - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTE0xYURWQ0lTMXpfVTVXNzFtRW1YaGtFanRZS2V3b2xNZUFzZ25vRDJOaVNpbVBWME13WFFlcENYakR2X3VPTGFENHpJUG5NMEg2RmVncEVWa0ZFZGFKMmV6RFA3QW5jUkZudHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Engineers have developed a novel dental floss device that can detect cortisol, a hormone linked to stress, through saliva, offering a painless, real-time method for stress monitoring.&lt;/span&gt; The device uses electropolymerized molecularly imprinted polymers (eMIPs), which act like custom molds to recognize specific molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With accuracy comparable to current biosensors, this floss-based tech could make stress tracking part of daily routines. Researchers aim to adapt the system for other saliva-based health markers, potentially transforming personal health monitoring across conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress Detection:&lt;/strong&gt; The floss-based sensor measures cortisol from saliva using advanced polymer molds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-Marker Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Can be adapted to detect other biomarkers, like glucose or estrogen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home Use:&lt;/strong&gt; Designed for untrained individuals, making daily stress tracking simple and noninvasive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Tufts University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chronic stress can lead to increased blood pressure and cardiovascular disease, decreased immune function, depression, and anxiety. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the tools we use to monitor stress are often imprecise or expensive, relying on self-reporting questionnaires and psychiatric evaluations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110350"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a person with a swab in their mouth." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The saliva is picked up by capillary action through a very narrow channel in the floss. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now a Tufts interdisciplinary engineer and his team have devised a simple device using specially designed floss that can easily and accurately measure cortisol, a stress hormone, in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It started in a collaboration with several departments across Tufts, examining how stress and other cognitive states affect problem solving and learning,” said Sameer Sonkusale, professor of electrical and computer engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t want measurement to create an additional source of stress, so we thought, can we make a sensing device that becomes part of your day-to-day routine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cortisol is a stress marker found in saliva, so flossing seemed like a natural fit to take a daily sample.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their design of a saliva-sensing dental floss looks just like a common floss pick, with the string stretched across two prongs extending from a flat plastic handle, all about the size of your index finger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The saliva is picked up by capillary action through a very narrow channel in the floss. The fluid is drawn into the pick handle and an attached tab, where it spreads across electrodes that detect the cortisol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortisol recognition on the electrodes is accomplished with a remarkable technology developed almost 30 years ago called electropolymerized molecularly imprinted polymers (eMIPs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They work similarly to the way you might make a plaster cast of your hand. A polymer is formed around a template molecule, in this case cortisol, which is later removed to leave behind binding sites. These sites have a physical and chemical shape “memory” of the target molecule so they can bind free-floating molecules that are coming in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eMIP molds are versatile, so one can create dental floss sensors that detect other molecules that can be found in saliva, such as estrogen for fertility tracking, glucose for diabetes monitoring, or markers for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also potential for detecting multiple biomarkers in saliva at the same time, for more accurate monitoring of stress, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The eMIP approach is a game changer,” said Sonkusale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Biosensors have typically been developed using antibodies or other receptors that pick up the molecule of interest. Once a marker is found, a lot of work has to go into bioengineering the receiving molecule attached to the sensor. eMIP does not rely on a lot of investment in making antibodies or receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you discover a new marker for stress or any other disease or condition, you can just create a polymer cast in a very short period of time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accuracy of the cortisol sensors is comparable to the best-performing sensors on the market or in development. Bringing this device into the home and in the hands of individuals without need for training will make it possible to fold stress monitoring into many aspects of health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently Sonkusale and his colleagues are creating a startup to try and bring the product to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He points out that while the dental floss sensor is quantitatively highly accurate, the practice of tracking markers in saliva is best for monitoring, not for the initial diagnosis of a condition. That’s in part because saliva markers can still have variations between individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For diagnostics, blood is still the gold standard, but once you are diagnosed and put on medication, if you need to track, say, a cardiovascular condition over time to see if your heart health is improving, then monitoring with the sensor can be easy and allows for timely interventions when needed,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces&lt;/em&gt;, adds to a number of  thread-based sensor innovations by Sonkusale and his research team including sensors that can detect gases, metabolites in sweat, or movement when embedded in clothing and transistors that can be woven into flexible electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this mental health and neurotech research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#234e4a48460d504a4f5546516357564557500d464756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mike Silver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://tufts.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tufts University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Mike Silver – Tufts University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5c02988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Saliva-Sensing Dental Floss: An Innovative Tool for Assessing Stress via On-Demand Salivary Cortisol Measurement with Molecularly Imprinted Polymer and Thread Microfluidics Integration&lt;/a&gt;” by Sameer Sonkusale et al. &lt;em&gt;ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saliva-Sensing Dental Floss: An Innovative Tool for Assessing Stress via On-Demand Salivary Cortisol Measurement with Molecularly Imprinted Polymer and Thread Microfluidics Integration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On-demand dental-floss-based point-of-care platform is developed for the noninvasive and real-time quantification of salivary cortisol utilizing redox-molecule embedded molecularly imprinted polymer structures and thread microfluidics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herein, we explore the high-surface-area graphene-based electrode substrate for electrochemically synthesizing selective cortisol MIPs and integrate it with thread microfluidics to build a highly sensitive cortisol-sensing platform for stress monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This platform uses flossing to collect and transport saliva to a flexible electrochemical sensor via capillary microfluidics, where cortisol, a stress biomarker, is measured. This strategy allowed us to detect cortisol as low as 0.048 pg mL&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; in real-time with a detection range of 0.10–10,000 pg mL&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.9916).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The saliva-sensing dental floss provides results within 11–12 min. The thread-based microfluidic design minimizes interference and ensures consistent repeatability when testing both artificial and actual human saliva samples, yielding 98.64–102.4% recoveries with a relative standard deviation of 5.01%, demonstrating high accuracy and precision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the human saliva sample (as part of the stress study), the platform showed a high correlation (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.9910) against conventional ELISA assays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined with a wireless readout, this saliva floss offers a convenient way to monitor daily stress levels. It can be extended to detect other critical salivary biomarkers with high sensitivity and selectivity in complex environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 12:59:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE0xYURWQ0lTMXpfVTVXNzFtRW1YaGtFanRZS2V3b2xNZUFzZ25vRDJOaVNpbVBWME13WFFlcENYakR2X3VPTGFENHpJUG5NMEg2RmVncEVWa0ZFZGFKMmV6RFA3QW5jUkZudHc</guid></item><item><title>医生揭示了您需要开始服用的关键维生素组合- AOL.com | Doctors Reveal the Crucial Vitamin Combo You Need to Start Taking - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE1wSEt5Y0VwWVNyS0x6OEp0aEVzcTdoYkFxMnpLYVpXSDB4Y21ETVFqQ0thbVBFckRHT0xuX0wwUnd4WXNnUWRORDhfUEl3ckZCbWk3bWlfbGJweWoyNzhrZGlPTVA2TXZNNGtxNEFwSDViSllaTjZTS19sMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;6 Ideal Vitamin Pairs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Tanja Ivanova - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some things just go better together — and that includes certain vitamins and minerals.

You can call them a power couple: &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11124756/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that &lt;strong&gt;pairing these nutrients in a meal together is more effective than eating them separately.&lt;/strong&gt; This same synergistic effect applies if you’re taking iron supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you consume iron-rich foods or an iron supplement alongside a source of vitamin C — like a glass or orange juice — it helps convert iron into a form that’s easier for your body to absorb,” explains Dr. Church. “This pairing is especially beneficial to vegetarians or anyone looking to naturally improve their iron levels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin A and zinc&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-Consumer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Vitamin A;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Vitamin A&lt;/a&gt; supports your vision, skin health, immune system and more — but it depends on zinc to do its job.&lt;strong&gt; Zinc deficiency &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11756065/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lowers the bioavailability;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lowers the bioavailability&lt;/a&gt; of vitamin A, and because these deficiencies tend to occur at the same time, it’s a smart move to combine these nutrients. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve seen firsthand that vitamin A, whether from foods like carrots or supplements, doesn’t get processed as efficiently when people are low in zinc,” says Dr. Church. “Ensuring you get enough zinc from zinc-rich foods, like beans or shellfish, when you’re also eating vitamin A-rich foods helps these nutrients work together so vitamin A can be effectively absorbed and transported in the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin E and selenium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antioxidants are molecules that protect your cells from damage — and together, they’re even more powerful.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2405457723011968" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Vitamin E and selenium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Vitamin E and selenium&lt;/a&gt; are a prime example of complementary antioxidants that make an excellent team.&lt;/strong&gt; Selenium has the ability to help “recycle” vitamin E in your body, bringing it back to its active form to fight even more free radicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By getting both nutrients — for instance, eating selenium-rich Brazil nuts along with vitamin E-rich almonds or spinach — you enhance the antioxidant impact,” says Dr. Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin D, vitamin K2 and vitamin A&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk about a triple threat: &lt;strong&gt;This fat-soluble vitamin trio works synergistically to support bone health, immune function and proper calcium utilization&lt;/strong&gt;. Together, vitamin D, vitamin K, and vitamin A help ensure that your body functions at its best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vitamin K2 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5613455/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:helps direct calcium to bones;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;helps direct calcium to bones&lt;/a&gt; rather than soft tissues when vitamin D increases calcium absorption, while vitamin A balances the immune-regulating properties of vitamin D,” says Dr. Cole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamins you shouldn't mix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to remember that not all vitamins and minerals get along. Some nutrients actually counteract each other, which means spacing them out is a smarter approach. Some examples of &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a64620677/vitamins-you-shouldnt-mix/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin combinations to avoid;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin combinations to avoid&lt;/a&gt; include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, certain nutrients can supercharge the healthy powers of other nutrients when you take them together. But ultimately, synergy is more than just pairing the right nutrients — timing, balance and individual needs matter, too. Always talk to your healthcare provider before adding potential supplements to your routine to make sure they’re safe and effective for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 12:41:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE1wSEt5Y0VwWVNyS0x6OEp0aEVzcTdoYkFxMnpLYVpXSDB4Y21ETVFqQ0thbVBFckRHT0xuX0wwUnd4WXNnUWRORDhfUEl3ckZCbWk3bWlfbGJweWoyNzhrZGlPTVA2TXZNNGtxNEFwSDViSllaTjZTS19sMA</guid></item><item><title>根据新科学，步行仅需5分钟即可对您的大脑产生影响- AOL.com | Walking For Just 5 Minutes Does This To Your Brain, Per New Science - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE0tdW5MT1hZRVZ0REZrcDJxSHp1eG9KZ253X3RGQVVFY0ZNOC1jTDEzcnNpTVZyVkpuNnpmU1VkOTVlc1RRYmFIMFVkcnJvcU5SOFgzWENQMUY3dUpLS09SSUJyaFVCeGtORlowTlNKSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Walking For Just 5 Minutes Does This To Your Brain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Westend61 - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new study found five minutes of a certain type of exercise can boost your brain health, especially in older adults.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to the elevation in your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g30985585/hiit-workout-at-home/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart rate;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart rate&lt;/a&gt; with "brisk" physical activity, more blood flow goes to your brain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The key is to exercise to the point where you notice heart rate and breathing rate increase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64803574/brain-doctors-neurologists-on-protecting-brain-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Taking care of your brain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Taking care of your brain&lt;/a&gt; requires a 360 approach, and includes simple things like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a42112641/7-day-meal-plan-for-weight-loss/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:eating well;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;eating well&lt;/a&gt;, exercising regularly, and constantly challenging your mind by learning and trying new things. But new research also suggests that logging just five minutes of a particular exercise can help give your brain a big boost, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/54/4/afaf072/8106300?login=false" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Age and Aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Age and Aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, found that doing short bursts of exercise that raise your heart rate can help enhance cognitive performance, especially in older adults. But what kind of exercise are we talking about and why does it help? Here’s the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil,&lt;/a&gt; DO, is a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA; &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev,&lt;/a&gt; MD, is the medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University; &lt;a href="https://www.adventhealth.com/institute/adventhealth-research-institute/team/audrey-collins" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Audrey Collins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Audrey Collins&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, is the lead study author and a post-doctoral research scientist with AdventHealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers analyzed data from 585 older adults between the ages of 65 and 80 who participated in the longitudinal IGNITE trial. The researchers looked at a range of things, including the participants’ &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64853713/sleep-cognitive-performance-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sleep habits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sleep habits&lt;/a&gt;, physical activity, and sedentary behavior over 24 hours, and stacked that against their cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a macro level, the researchers found that people who did more exercise had better brain health. When they did less, it seemed to decline. But when they dug into the specifics, they found that doing just five minutes of exercise that gets your heart rate up—like a brisk walk, water aerobics, or a light jog—was linked with better cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, when people did more moderate-to-vigorous physical activity like brisk walking, they had better processing speed, (how fast your brain thinks), executive function (how well you plan, focus, and multitask) and working memory (your ability to store information for short periods of time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is brisk walking good for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big perk of brisk walking is that it can get your blood pumping, says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil,&lt;/a&gt; DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. “Brisk walking increase blood flow to your legs and gets your heart rate up,” he says. “Any time your heart rate goes up, the flow of blood to your head is increased.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise and movement in general is helpful for brain health, explains &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev,&lt;/a&gt; MD, medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University. “What’s good for the body is usually good for the brain,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want more walking inspo?

The researchers specifically wrote this: “Moving from ~1 minute of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day to ~6 minutes per day had the largest predicted differences in the domains of executive function/attentional control, processing speed, and working memory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is considered “brisk” walking?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brisk walking is basically any walk speed that gets your heart rate up. "Brisk walking involves moving at a pace where you notice an elevation in your heart rate and breathing rate, which reflects an increased intensity of physical activity," says &lt;a href="https://www.adventhealth.com/institute/adventhealth-research-institute/team/audrey-collins" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Audrey Collins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Audrey Collins&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, lead study author and a post-doctoral research scientist with AdventHealth. "For example, walking at a leisurely pace is representative of low-intensity physical activity, while brisk walking at a faster pace moves into a moderate-intensity level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, next time you’re short on time for a full workout, consider at least taking a quick walk around the block. It’ll do your brain health a solid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Clifton 9&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp

    &lt;p&gt;Conductor John Mauceri is no stranger to health struggles. He was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis in 2017, then chronic lymphocytic leukemia and interstitial lung disease in 2019. Medication treated the conditions and sent the cancer into remission, but he has remained on the lookout for recurrence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2024, Mauceri, then 78, contracted COVID-19. He struggled to climb the stairs and developed a "troublesome" cough. He went to the emergency room at NYU Langone, where he has previously received medical care. An X-ray found viral pneumonia and severe lung disease. Doctors removed three liters of liquid from his right lung. The only relief, he said, was that there was no trace of cancer. He left the hospital about a week later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within weeks, new symptoms quickly emerged. First, his left ankle swelled. Then the swelling continued up his leg. As the weeks passed, the swelling entered his abdomen and inched down his right leg. At one point, Mauceri was gaining a pound every day. He was also dealing with fatigue and shortness of breath. He couldn't conduct. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was wearing somebody else's body, at least from my waist down. I couldn't wear normal clothes," Mauceri said. "Putting shoes on was hard. I couldn't walk through my house." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one on his care team could identify what was causing the symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I had an oncologist, I had a pulmonologist, a rheumatologist. I had a lot of doctors, and they all thought it was somebody else's domain," Mauceri said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Searching for a diagnosis &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Adam Skolnick, a cardiologist at NYU Langone and one of Mauceri's doctors, said the team first looked for more common causes for the swelling. Mauceri underwent MRIs and other tests. An exam found his lymph system was working normally. Cardiac catheterization, where a thin tube is guided through the heart, found no signs of heart disease. There were no signs of blood clots, cancer recurrence or other likely conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the swelling was beginning to strain Mauceri's body, putting him at risk of multi-organ failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While studying the images of Mauceri's heart, Skolnick began to form a theory. But "the only definitive way to fully diagnose and treat Mr. Mauceri would be through surgery to open the chest," the doctor said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is pericardial constriction? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skolnick thought Mauceri might have pericardial constriction, which occurs when the sac around the heart, or the pericardium, is thickened by scarring. That prevents the heart from fully opening. It can create pressure, resulting in swelling in the legs and abdomen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a rare condition that is usually acquired because of a prior illness, Skolnick said, including viral infections like COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since there are no tests that look at the pericardium specifically, Mauceri would have to undergo open-heart surgery to confirm the diagnosis. The condition would also be treated in that same surgery. After Mauceri's care team eliminated all other possible options, they decided it was time to go into the operating room in June 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mauceri was nervous about the prospect but it seemed like his only option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was no alternative," he said. "I said, 'Well, let's just do it.'" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A high-risk surgery  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eugene Grossi, a cardiothoracic surgeon and leader of NYU Langone Heart's robotic surgery team, performed Mauceri's surgery. When he opened the conductor's chest, he found that Mauceri's "heart was trapped" inside a thick shell of scarring. Typically, the pericardium is like a paper bag. Mauceri's was like shoe leather, Grossi said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You don't think about it, but your lungs expand with every breath you take. Your chest wall opens. Your lungs expand. The heart does also, because it has to be able to accept the blood that's coming back from your arteries and veins. And his was just trapped," Grossi explained. That entrapment leads to fluid retention, creating swelling, Grossi said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the scarring, Mauceri's heart was functioning well. With the diagnosis made, Grossi and the surgical team had to scrape the pericardium and attached scar tissue carefully off the heart. Removing the pericardium creates no lasting health issues, but the procedure, called a pericardiectomy, is a delicate one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's almost like the heart is a hard-boiled egg, and we're peeling off the shell," Grossi said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mauceri's procedure went smoothly, his doctor said. Once the pericardium was removed, Mauceri's urine output bag began to fill, proving to the surgeons that the pressure was off and blood was pumping smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Every day is a miracle"   &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Mauceri was released from the hospital, he quickly began losing weight. He said he feels like he's in the best shape he's been since college. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is extraordinary because not only did I survive it, but I'm stronger than ever as a result of it," Mauceri said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His health struggles didn't end immediately. Shortly after the heart surgery, he was hospitalized again for a blockage of the small intestine. That was quickly treated, again at NYU Langone, but it slowed his recovery. It wasn't until December 2024, more than a year after he was diagnosed with COVID-19, that Mauceri was able to conduct an orchestra again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mauceri conducted back-to-back performances in London and Paris, getting used to being onstage again. In May, he traveled to Japan to conduct in Tokyo. The 13-hour flight and long performance days felt like the first test of his endurance after his illnesses, he said. The performance was a raging success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mauceri said he has no plans to slow down now that he's back to work. In between spending time with his family in New York City, he plans to travel the country for other concerts, including at the Hollywood Bowl in September, shortly after his 80th birthday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I was conducting as if I wasn't on the cusp of being 80 anymore," he said. "I was allowed to do that because my doctors gave me this added time in my life where I can do that. So every day is a miracle. Every day I'm grateful for what they did." &lt;/p&gt;

Turns out there’s truth to them: The time our body naturally &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/better-sleep-avoid-habits_l_62bef6dfe4b065b10ad3bed0" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="goes to sleep and wakes up" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b432ae4b095274facca2a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="62bef6dfe4b065b10ad3bed0" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;goes to sleep and wakes up&lt;/a&gt; is not only part of our genetics, but part of the natural aging process, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we age, our bodies change both internally and externally, which is a major factor behind the sleep changes that come later in life. “&lt;span&gt;Like most of the things that change with age, there’s not just one reason, and they are all interconnected,” said &lt;a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/people/faculty/clustig.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Cindy Lustig" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b432ae4b095274facca2a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/people/faculty/clustig.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Cindy Lustig&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;We asked Lustig and other experts to break down the main reasons why this occurs, and what you can do to push back if you just want those few extra hours of Zzzs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earlier wake times are part of the natural aging process.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like other aspects of our physical and mental health, the brain becomes less responsive as we age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The wiring of the brain is likely not sensing ... and responding to the inputs as well as it should because it’s an aging brain,” said &lt;a href="https://deptmedicine.arizona.edu/profile/sairam-parthasarathy-md" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Sairam Parthasarathy" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b432ae4b095274facca2a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://deptmedicine.arizona.edu/profile/sairam-parthasarathy-md" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. Sairam Parthasarathy&lt;/a&gt;, the director of the Center for Sleep and Circadian Sciences at the University of Arizona Health Sciences. These inputs include sunset, sunlight, meals, social cues and physical activity that help mark where we are in a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are all what we call time givers, or they give time to the brain,” he said. In other words, they help the brain sense where it is in the 24-hour circadian cycle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, for a younger person, dinner time may help the brain understand that bedtime is in a few hours; for someone older, this connection may not happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nerves that are supposed to give the brain time cues have undergone the same amount of &lt;span&gt;degeneration as the brain, Parthasarathy said. T&lt;/span&gt;his inability to sense time cues is part of the reason why older people tend to get tired before their children or grandchildren. And, as a result, wake up fully rested and earlier than the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The light our eyes take in is part of it, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Interestingly, one of [the reasons] seems to be that the vision changes that come with age reduce the intensity of the degree of light stimulation that our brain receives, which plays an important role in ‘setting’ our circadian clock and keeping it on track,” Lustig said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parthasarathy explained that this is especially true for people with cataracts, a common eye condition that impacts more than 50% of Americans ages 80 and up, &lt;a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/cataracts" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to the National Institutes of Health" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b432ae4b095274facca2a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/cataracts" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;according to the National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;. Cataracts cause blurred vision, double vision and general trouble seeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If&lt;span&gt; there’s cataracts, the evening light doesn’t go into the eyes as much, so, according to the brain, sunset is earlier than when it actually set,” Parthasarathy said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter? Since there is less light getting into the eyes because of the vision issues cataracts cause, the body starts to release &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/melatonin" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="melatonin" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b432ae4b095274facca2a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/topic/melatonin" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;melatonin&lt;/a&gt; (the sleep hormone) earlier than it should. For younger people, melatonin “starts rising after sunset,” Parthasarathy said, which is why you generally feel tired a few hours after. &lt;span&gt;For people with cataracts whose brain thinks sunset was earlier, their perceived sunset is earlier, which makes them tired sooner in the evening. And going to bed sooner means waking up earlier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There is some evidence that cataract removal surgery can help improve sleep quality and duration by helping those light cues get through,” Lustig said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: LWA/Dann Tardif via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;LWA/Dann Tardif via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The amount of light your eyes take in each evening impacts when you're ready to go to sleep.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If this is you, there are a few steps you can take to sleep better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Parthasarathy, if you struggle with this issue, you should ignore the advice to put away the screens and instead expose yourself to bright light in the late evening. This can mean going for a walk outside before the sun sets, reading a book on a bright iPad, getting artificial lights for your home or watching TV on a bright screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;These bright lights will tell the brain that the sun hasn’t set yet, which will hold the melatonin production, he said. To help yourself stay up a little later (and sleep a little later as a result), Parthasarathy said you should try these things 30 to 60 minutes before sunset, which will vary depending on the time of year and where you live in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

            Infection-causing fungi responsible for millions of deaths a year will&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;spread significantly to new regions as the planet heats up, new &lt;a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6545782/v1" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; predicts&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— and the world is not prepared. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000b3b6madevfu4v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fungi are absolutely everywhere. A vast kingdom of organisms, from mold to mushrooms, they grow in environments such as soil, compost and water. They play an important role in ecosystems but can have a devastating impact on human health: Fungal infections kill an &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(23)00692-8/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;estimated 2.5 million people&lt;/a&gt; a year, and a lack of data means that number could be far higher.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000c3b6mjhfcv2ch@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yet we are still very far from understanding them, especially how these incredibly adaptable organisms will respond &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/09/climate/2024-hottest-year-record"&gt;to a warming climate&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000e3b6mxjc9n0a9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A team of scientists from Manchester University used computer simulations and forecasts to map the potential future spread of Aspergillus, a common group of fungi found all over the world that can cause aspergillosis, a life-threatening disease primarily affecting the lungs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000f3b6mpvok5bm4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They found certain Aspergillus species will expand their range as the climate crisis intensifies, pushing into new parts of North America, Europe, China and Russia. The study, published this month, is currently being peer reviewed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000g3b6mzcvtqmyt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Fungi are relatively under-researched compared to viruses and parasites, but these maps show that fungal pathogens will likely impact most areas of the world in the future,” said Norman van Rijn, one of the study’s authors and a climate change and infectious diseases researcher at the University of Manchester.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0wei30002i3b6mghcwbyjf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The field has seen new attention thanks to the popular HBO television drama “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/25/world/zombie-fungus-ophiocordyceps-the-last-of-us-scn"&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/a&gt;,” which follows people trying to survive in a world where an infectious mutant fungus has turned most of the population into violent monsters. (HBO and CNN share the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0wei30002j3b6mds1obbu4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s fiction, van Rijn said, but he hopes it will raise the profile of fungal infections&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that are killing millions in reality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000k3b6mlr03crll@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aspergillus fungi grow like small filaments in soils all over the world.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Like almost all fungi, they release huge numbers of tiny spores that spread through the air.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000l3b6mtpo31ztq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Humans inhale spores every day but most people won’t experience any health issues; their immune system clears them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000m3b6m8qsvu0ds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s a different story for those with lung conditions including asthma, cystic fibrosis and COPD, as well as people with compromised immune systems, such as cancer and organ transplant patients, and those who have had severe flu or Covid-19.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000n3b6mutejajyy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If the body’s immune system fails to clear the spores, the fungus “starts to grow and basically kind of eat you from the inside out, saying it really bluntly,” van Rijn said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000o3b6m8g0c2e0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aspergillosis has very high mortality rates at around 20% to 40%, he said. It’s also very difficult to diagnose, as doctors don’t always have it on their radar and patients often present with fevers and coughs, symptoms common to many illnesses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0w3psi00263b6m31fma28r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fungal pathogens are also becoming increasingly resistant to treatment, van Rijn added. There are only four classes of antifungal medicines available.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe000q3b6m5oea2g0c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This all spells bad news as the climate shifts open up new areas for Aspergillus to colonize.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0v4x2j001i3b6m87ll1lwe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aspergillus flavus, a species that tends to prefer hotter, tropical climates, could increase its spread by 16% if humans continue burning large amounts of fossil fuels, the study found. It’s predicted to push into parts of northern America, northern China and Russia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0w56hf00283b6mrvayn1ax@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This species can cause severe infections in humans and is resistant to many antifungal medications. It also infects a range of food crops, posing a potential threat to food security. The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240060241" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; added Aspergillus flavus to its critical group of fungal pathogens in 2022 because of its public health impact and antifungal resistance risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe000t3b6mihcjfnoo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aspergillus fumigatus, which prefers more temperate climates, is predicted to spread northwards toward the North Pole as global temperatures rise. Its spread could increase by 77.5% by 2100, the study found, potentially exposing 9 million people in Europe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe000v3b6mpwmmxgiv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Conversely, temperatures in some regions, including sub-Saharan Africa, could become so hot they are no longer hospitable to Aspergillus fungi. This could bring its own problems, as fungi play an important role in ecosystems, including healthy soils.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe000w3b6mg33vq8ii@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As well as expanding their growing range, a warming world could also be increasing fungi’s temperature tolerance, allowing them to better survive inside human bodies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe000y3b6miw0w6cms@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Extreme weather events such as drought, floods and heatwaves can affect fungi, too, helping to spread spores over long distances. There have been spikes in fungal disease following natural disasters, such &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3620763/" target="_blank"&gt;as the outbreak&lt;/a&gt; after the 2011 tornado in Joplin, Missouri.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0vacg9001s3b6m7ny7em58@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new Aspergillus&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;study “rightfully shines a light on the threat of fungi that dwell in our natural environment and how under-prepared we are to cope with shifts in their prevalence,” said Elaine Bignell, co-director of the MRC Centre for Medical Mycology at the University of Exeter, who was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Many uncertainties remain, however, and there is still a huge amount of research to be done, she told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe00103b6mhskzz2pj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite the deadly nature of aspergillosis, there is a real lack of data on where the pathogen is in the environment and who gets infected, said Justin Remais, a professor of environmental health sciences at UC Berkeley, who was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe00113b6mkf33h6fj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He is leading a study of more than 100 million patients across the United States, which identified more than 20,000 aspergillosis cases between 2013 and 2023. The number of cases is increasing about 5% each year, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0wexbn002n3b6mivne2o96@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Fungal pathogens are becoming increasingly common and resistant to treatment, and we are only beginning to understand how climate change is contributing,” he told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe00143b6m9j3smscr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People are used to hearing about diseases caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites, but much less so fungal diseases, said Bignell. “There is a desperate need to reverse this trend given the lethality,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe00153b6mgxsiubj5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Any of us in the future might be affected.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

The creator of the so-called “department of government efficiency”, who once boasted he had fed “USAID into the wood chipper”, found himself defending his cuts to humanitarian aid. Just days before, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/bill-gates-give-away-fortune-by-2045-200bn-worlds-poorest-2025-05-08/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt; had accused the world’s richest person of “killing the world’s poorest children”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In one especially fraught exchange with Bloomberg interviewer Mishal Husain, Musk rebuked a question about whether his cuts to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usaid" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;USAID&lt;/a&gt; had imperiled HIV/Aids programs and claimed he would “fix it right now” if any services had, in fact, been defunded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“First of all, the program, the Aids medication program, is continuing. So, your fundamental premise is wrong. It is continuing,” Musk said. “It is false. It’s false. It’s false.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Rather than Musk’s cuts leaving HIV/Aids programs intact, however, global health officials said that Doge’s efforts have in reality hampered their work worldwide and thrown the protection of large swaths of people from disease into disarray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="doges-dismantling-of-usaid-plunges-aids-services-into-chaos" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Doge’s dismantling of USAID plunges Aids services into chaos&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prior to Doge’s cuts and the Trump administration’s freeze on foreign aid, the US was involved in a wide range of HIV/Aids treatment and prevention programs across dozens of countries. The government implemented the majority of its operations through Pepfar, a USAID-funded program that has contributed more than $110bn to preventing and treating the virus since the initiative began in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Since Doge dismantled USAID in January, however, the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/mar/18/global-health-trump-usaid-cuts-hiv-aids-2030-drugs-vaccine-research-africa" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;future of Pepfar is uncertain&lt;/a&gt;, and many of its services are in jeopardy. A temporary waiver from the state department has allowed funding for some HIV/Aids programs to continue, but only those aimed at treating people who are already living with HIV, as well as pregnant or breastfeeding women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As a result, many prevention programs involving pre-exposure prophylaxis drugs, or Prep, ground to a halt without US funding. Even services that were allowed, such as testing and treatment, also stopped due to the disruption and confusion caused by Doge’s shutdown of USAID, according to the &lt;a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/02/1159901#:~:text=Thousands%20of%20individuals%20%2D%20women%2C%20young%20girls%2C,for%20HIV%20prevention%2C%20screenings%20for%20tuberculosis%20or" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;. People who showed up to receive testing or medicine often found that no one was there to give it to them, according to a UN health official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There were thousands of healthcare workers and community health workers, laboratorians and data clerks, for example, that immediately stopped work,” said Dr Angeli Achrekar, deputy executive director of the programme branch at the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and a former Pepfar official. “It’s not like you just turn on the light switch and all of a sudden these services start up again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The effects of the cuts have been almost immediate, according to Achrekar, and could roll back years of advancements in combating HIV infections. In Botswana, the number of people receiving Prep has decreased by half since last year. The 30,000 people in Mozambique who were receiving Prep at the end of last year recently went down to 19,000, according to a UN tally. In Zimbabwe, the number of people receiving Prep declined from 4,000 to 1,800 in the same time frame. In Nigeria, 850,000 condoms distributed in December went down to 300,000 by February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s country after country,” Achrekar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-miracle-drug-cast-into-uncertainty" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;A miracle drug cast into uncertainty&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The cuts to prevention programs have also caused confusion and uncertainty around the rollout of a highly anticipated new drug called Lenacapivir. The drug, which is under review at the US Food and Drug Administration, protects patients against HIV infection through a single shot given every six months. Two &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/breakthrough-2024" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;separate large trials&lt;/a&gt; across different populations have shown that it almost entirely blocks the risk of contracting the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-16" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-16" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;after newsletter promotion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s nearly 100% effective at stopping new infections,” Achrekar said. “It is the closest thing to a vaccine that we have ever had in the HIV response.” Other researchers have called it a “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jul/26/lenacapavir-drug-trial-linda-gail-bekker-treating-hiv-aids-africa-women-pregnancy" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;miracle&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Pepfar announced at the end of last year that it was partnering with The Global Fund, an international organization that finances global health programs, in an effort to roll out Lenacapivir to at least 2 million people within the next three years. Doge’s cuts have thrown a potential wrench in those plans, however, since the drug would fall under the category of preventative services that the tate department’s waiver says should no longer be funded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;At the Qatar Economic Forum this week, Musk insisted that medication programs were continuing, and, when confronted with the example of Lenacapivir, suggested he would restore its funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Which ones aren’t being funded? I’ll fix it right now,” Musk claimed, later adding: “If in fact this is true, which I doubt it is, then we’ll fix it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In response to Musk’s comments, UNAIDS &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/pressreleaseandstatementarchive/2025/may/20250521_PR_Musk_HIV_services" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;released a statement&lt;/a&gt; saying it was encouraged that he would review the crisis caused by halts to US funding. Musk has made similar pledges about restoring health programs that Doge cut in the past, however: in February, Musk said that efforts to prevent the spread of Ebola had been accidentally canceled but were then restored – a claim that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/26/elon-musk-ebola-prevention-usaid-doge/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;USAID officials said was false&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While the Global Fund waits to see what the Trump administration decides to do with Pepfar, it is hoping to carry on with its plans for Lenacapivir whether the US is involved or not. Losing Pepfar’s partnership would mean a huge decrease in funding, however, as well as Pepfar’s extensive connections to organizations that could help in administering the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We’re not backing off the ambition to deliver Lenacapivir to two million people if we can,” said Peter Sands, the executive director of the Global Fund. “The extent to which we can continue to do that in partnership with Pepfar is uncertain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Since the waiver was issued on 1 February there has been no clarity or new policy released on what the Trump administration plans to do with Pepfar. US partners working on prevention services have had their agreements terminated, while UNAIDS projects that if Pepfar’s treatment and prevention services are stopped entirely, it would result in an additional 6.6m HIV infections by 2029.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE10bkhxME1tTzMyWF82b0RNblRPSWMyVjR4SnlLV3RPME01NW1ZZnRvblgyeTd5S1M1LXZPZDF1amxHZnZyRXhmd19WNm5CdG9pbnRYcmhoQ2xGdHNKOFRWOVdVZjhZZ3BLbFo3X2ZWdDIwVVB4</guid></item><item><title>它不在您的脑海中：围绝经期绝对会影响心理健康- MindBodyGreen | It’s Not In Your Head: Perimenopause Definitely Impacts Mental Health - MindBodyGreen</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxPUVh6RU1VTHJCT29ETDZjQ3lBX2o5ZjJLY3JPRjkzcWdFX3l5dkhJdGsxTTRsR005UUh1M3czSklVYThpblBrQU1KUnk0NnJlZV94aXM4UE9JTzM0eUhtVjlfMGJoWlBNbWxLcWRPYnhyRVBIR2plYWotcGRRV3NKcDZFNGdxWHd6bXR5a2pONnZyS29RZEVIOXh3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span id="content"&gt;&lt;div end="false" class="sc-11rlt5o-4 gjIquG"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perimenopause is more than hot flashes and irregular cycles; it’s a powerful neuroendocrine transition that can significantly impact a woman’s mental health.

    &lt;p&gt;The scientists found that one of the most problematic aspects of owner behaviour, which the dogs picked up on the most was taking the mental burden of a job home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ruminating about work problems, meaning going over negative thoughts about work when you’re at home, facilitated the transfer of job stress to the dog,” Dr Mitropoulos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So cutting off work-related thoughts when you’re at home should help prevent transferring your job stress to your dog.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She advised checking work emails as little as possible and not working when at home, as well as making sure work and home were distinctly separated - both mentally and physically - for people who work from home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If possible, try to keep your workspace in a designated and remote area of the home so you’re not seeing reminders of work while you’re supposed to be relaxing,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Practising mindfulness has been shown to reduce rumination, and there are now apps that guide people through mindfulness exercises, which you can do at the end of your workday.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that the best way to relax for both owners and dogs is to play together at home after work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Playing with your dog is a great way to pull your thoughts away from work,” Dr Mitropoulos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Plus, if your dog is stressed due to not receiving enough attention because you’re busy mulling over work issues, playing with your pet is a great way to give him the attention he needs while also pulling your mind away from work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the journal Scientific Reports.&lt;/p&gt;

Subsequent tests revealed masses in his lower esophagus, lymph nodes and liver, &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt; noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outlet reported that Dorsey underwent routine check-ups every six months, and high blood pressure was his only concern before his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/esophageal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20356084" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, "Esophageal cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the esophagus.

The most common factors  such as waning immunity, decreased vaccination rates, increased international travel, and the emergence of new variants contribute to these fluctuations. However, most infections so far remain mild, presenting symptoms such as fever, sore throat, fatigue.There is no immediate cause for alarm but better to be vigilant especially with vulnerable populations such as elderly people, immunocompromised hosts and those having chronic conditions like chronic kidney diseases, Diabetes Mellitus, COPD etc.," Dr. Divya advises. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 04:49:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgJBVV95cUxQRlpIdGJvMVg0bV9URXk1OGx2YlVaU2Y1dFo5Q0ZueHNiNllGMHRyb0JvcTlkR3ZSTU5UWV9FNlVjRGJleGl1ZzA5MGJSQk0yQnZfTlpueDhRUWVUZnpQTjFrUWJhYXdkSjYyNUMyLWotb1dIZGFGY0g5SWdQaFlSZnI1R24xMDREYzlla1BCMU5YU2pna3BId0NlcWZVckhIZGNtallRUW5sbDNOeXZwR29vRVpFY2xQN2lHSnVWRVltTXE4U2lNQTJ0V0w5ZEd0NGp2OWgzNml2S0ZqUDNBYUo0ZzdiMlB5OC1RZXlrUzl3b0FBUlNKWmYxTHpBMDRfQnZuMHlYTjV3dnFSOXVQS2V3</guid></item><item><title>​近期病例激增背后的新型冠状病毒NB.1.8.1 ：与之相关的症状-印度时报 | ​New COVID variant NB.1.8.1 behind surge in cases recently: Symptoms associated with it​ - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The symptoms of NB.1.8.1 are largely consistent with those of previous Omicron variants.

Other reported symptoms include headaches, nausea, loss of appetite, and gastrointestinal issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NB.1.8.1 has demonstrated a higher transmissibility rate compared to some earlier variants. Preliminary data suggest that this variant has an enhanced ability to bind to human cells, potentially leading to increased infection rates. The variant has been detected in travelers arriving at major U.S. airports, including those in California, Washington, Virginia, and New York.

They took standardised mental health tests, provided saliva samples to measure stress hormones, and had their mouth bacteria analysed using advanced DNA sequencing techniques.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the start of the six months, the healthy spouses scored normally on depression, anxiety, and sleep quality tests. However, after living with a partner with mental health issues, their scores were significantly higher. Their mouth bacteria resembled that of their depressed and anxious partners.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bacterial families like Clostridia, Veillonella, Bacillus, and Lachnospiraceae became more abundant in both partners. The bacteria are linked to brain disorders, including depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. Scientists believe that they affect the brain by compromising the blood-brain barrier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Women affected more &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, researchers found that women were more susceptible to this bacterial transmission; female spouses experienced more pronounced changes in both their oral microbiome and mental health scores.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also measured cortisol levels during the study and found that the stress hormone in healthy spouses married to depressed and anxious partners showed a significant increase over six months, indicating their stress response systems were being activated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

That’s because of a phytochemical called sulforaphane found in these veggies, which is known to help prevent numerous types of cancer in addition to prostate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silva adds that tomatoes and watermelon have one compound that has been found to be particularly protective against prostate cancer: lycopene. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332220306521" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research shows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that lycopene can not only slow the progression and growth of prostate cancer cells, but it also could provoke the death of prostate cancer cells. However, Brockton cautions that research is still limited on lycopene, and a strong link has not been established yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silva recommends eating at least five servings of whole fruits and vegetables daily to reap their cancer-protective effects—but the more you can eat, the better, she says. She advises keeping frozen fruits and vegetables—which are just as nutritious as fresh—stocked in your freezer to add into smoothies, oatmeal, or dinners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fill up on fiber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s another nutrient that fruits and vegetables have in common that has protective qualities against cancer: &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/2023/05/27/fiber-health-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber can help prevent cancer in numerous ways, experts say. Eating high-fiber foods—like whole grains, fruits, vegetables, beans, nuts, and seeds—can boost your gut health, which in turn strengthens your immune system, according to Brockton. A stronger immune system will give your body the tools to fight off potentially cancerous cells, he told &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3503404/#abstract1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:One study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; also found that eating high-fiber whole grains was able to lower risk of aggressive prostate cancer via the production of the sex-hormone binding globulin, which helps regulate androgen levels that influence prostate cancer growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Dietary Guidelines recommend that men consume about 28 to 34 grams of fiber per day, but Silva advises shooting for 35 grams. She recommends making easy swaps like brown rice for white rice or whole grain bread for white bread to boost your fiber intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Small changes like that can certainly help to move the needle,” Silva tells &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also reach for high-fiber foods like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oats, barley, quinoa, amaranth, bulgur, and millet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beans and lentils&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuts and seeds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocados&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leafy greens like kale, spinach, bok choy, and arugula&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apples and pears&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweet potatoes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Popcorn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add in omega-3s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some research also indicates that foods rich in &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/2022/10/05/omega-3s-brain-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:omega-3 fatty acids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; could also help slow the progression of prostate cancer.
