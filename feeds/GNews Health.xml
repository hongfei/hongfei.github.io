							&lt;p data-start="417" data-end="592"&gt;A lot of people treat aging like a downhill slope. But the truth is, if you’re over 65 and can still handle certain everyday habits with ease, you’re doing better than most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="594" data-end="782"&gt;It’s not about being able to run marathons or bench-press your body weight. The real markers of strong health are often tucked into the little things we do in the first hours of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="784" data-end="951"&gt;Morning routines reveal a lot. They test your balance, flexibility, cognition, energy, and even emotional health—all before you’ve finished your first cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="953" data-end="1065"&gt;Let’s break down eight simple morning abilities that reveal more about your health than any number on a chart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1072" data-end="1109"&gt;1. Get out of bed without effort&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1111" data-end="1288"&gt;Let’s start simple. If you can swing your legs out of bed and stand up without groaning, holding onto a dresser, or taking forever to find your balance, you’re in great shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1290" data-end="1505"&gt;Mobility and muscle strength naturally decline with age, but being able to rise smoothly from lying down is a powerful indicator of overall fitness. It shows your core, balance, and joints are all working in sync.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1507" data-end="1685"&gt;I remember staying with my grandfather in his late 70s—he never needed to “psych himself up” to get out of bed. He’d just get up, stretch, and move on. That’s health in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1687" data-end="2000"&gt;Physiotherapists often use simple functional tasks—like getting out of bed or rising from the floor—as quick gauges of mobility and independence. Studies show that&lt;a href="https://geriatrictoolkit.missouri.edu/srff/deBrito-Floor-Rise-Mortality-2012..pdf?.com"&gt; difficulty with these movements&lt;/a&gt; correlates with higher mortality risk and functional dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1687" data-end="2000"&gt;As one geriatric physical therapist put it: “The way someone gets out of bed is the way they’ll likely handle the rest of the day.” If it’s smooth and strong, you’re setting a solid tone for your morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2007" data-end="2036"&gt;2. Recall what day it is&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2038" data-end="2213"&gt;Sounds small, right? But it’s actually huge. Waking up and immediately knowing the day, where you are, and what’s on your schedule is a sign your cognitive health is intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2215" data-end="2427"&gt;Neurologists often use orientation—&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/memory-loss-and-forgetfulness/memory-problems-forgetfulness-and-aging?.com"&gt;assessing awareness&lt;/a&gt; of time, place, person, and situation—as a quick check of brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2429" data-end="2612"&gt;As the National Institute on Aging points out, “Cognitive changes are a normal part of aging, but significant memory loss is not.” Waking up clear-minded already gives you an edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2614" data-end="2978"&gt;I once stayed with a family friend in Spain who was in her 80s. Every morning, she would look at the calendar pinned to her fridge and say out loud, “It’s Wednesday, I have market today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2614" data-end="2978"&gt;It wasn’t because she was forgetful—it was because she liked reinforcing clarity. And she never missed a detail. That small act reflected how intact her mental sharpness was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2985" data-end="3025"&gt;3. Get dressed without needing help&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3027" data-end="3182"&gt;Pulling on a pair of pants, fastening buttons, or slipping on shoes doesn’t sound like much—but it actually requires flexibility, dexterity, and balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3184" data-end="3446"&gt;When I was traveling in Japan, I noticed how older adults there often prided themselves on maintaining independence in daily activities. They saw being able to dress themselves as a core part of dignity. And they weren’t wrong—it’s an underrated health marker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3448" data-end="3664"&gt;If you can manage your clothing without getting tangled up or losing your footing, you’re keeping independence alive. It’s also a subtle sign that arthritis or other mobility-limiting conditions haven’t taken over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3666" data-end="3950"&gt;And here’s the thing: small motor skills like buttoning a shirt are actually &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2018.00910/full?.com"&gt;linked to brain health&lt;/a&gt; too. Fine motor control requires coordination between your nervous system and muscles. If you can manage it seamlessly, it’s a two-for-one check of physical and cognitive resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3957" data-end="4015"&gt;4. Walk to the kitchen without aches slowing you down&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4017" data-end="4182"&gt;Can you make it from the bedroom to the kitchen with a steady pace, without joints locking up or pain forcing you to stop? If so, your mobility is in the top tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4184" data-end="4419"&gt;Walking is one of those things most of us take for granted until it’s gone. Morning movement without discomfort means your joints are holding up, your circulation is working, and your heart is strong enough to handle simple exertion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4421" data-end="4663"&gt;Doctors often use the “timed up and go” test to measure mobility in older adults. It’s exactly what it sounds like: stand up, walk a short distance, turn, and sit back down. If you can do that easily in the morning, you’re beating the odds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4665" data-end="4993"&gt;When I spent a summer in Lisbon, I’d often see groups of older locals walking briskly to the café first thing in the morning. No limping, no hesitation—just a steady stride. They weren’t walking for exercise, they were walking for life. That’s what good health really looks like: the freedom to move without thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5000" data-end="5031"&gt;5. Make yourself breakfast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5033" data-end="5153"&gt;Cooking—even something simple like oatmeal or toast—requires a blend of fine motor skills, problem-solving, and focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5155" data-end="5362"&gt;You’re standing, moving, stirring, maybe slicing some fruit. That’s coordination and stability at work. Plus, there’s the decision-making part: choosing what to eat, prepping it, and cleaning up afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5364" data-end="5620"&gt;As geriatric specialists note, “Instrumental activities of daily living” (things like cooking or managing finances) are some of the best measures of functional independence. If breakfast isn’t a challenge, your brain and body are cooperating beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5622" data-end="5840"&gt;There’s also something deeper here: the ritual of making food signals you’re still engaged with life. You’re not just grabbing whatever’s easiest—you’re participating in your own well-being. And that mindset matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5847" data-end="5889"&gt;6. Use technology without frustration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5891" data-end="6027"&gt;Checking your phone, texting a grandchild, or skimming the news on a tablet might not seem like health markers, but they actually are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6029" data-end="6227"&gt;Tech use relies on memory (remembering how apps work), motor skills (swiping, typing), and vision. Being able to handle this fluidly means you’ve kept pace with both cognitive and sensory demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6229" data-end="6452"&gt;I’ve mentioned this before in another piece: adaptability is one of the most overlooked signs of mental resilience. If you’re still adapting to new tools and apps, it’s a very good sign you’re keeping your brain flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6454" data-end="6718"&gt;As psychologist Carol Dweck noted, “Becoming is better than being.” The willingness to learn—even when it’s something as simple as figuring out how to adjust text size on your phone—signals a growth mindset. And that mindset is a powerful buffer against decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6725" data-end="6764"&gt;7. Do light exercise or stretching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6766" data-end="6908"&gt;If your morning includes even a few minutes of stretching, yoga, or a quick walk around the block, you’re investing in your future mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6910" data-end="7120"&gt;Exercise isn’t just about fitness—it keeps bones strong, maintains balance, and lowers the risk of falls. &lt;span class="relative -mx-px my-[-0.2rem] rounded px-px py-[0.2rem] transition-colors duration-100 ease-in-out"&gt;Long-term, moderate-intensity, multicomponent exercise (combining strength, balance, and flexibility) is shown to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2719424?.com"&gt;reduce fall risk by up to 34%&lt;/a&gt; in older adults.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7122" data-end="7414"&gt;I once stayed in a small town in Italy where older folks met in the town square to do stretches together before heading off to errands. Some used canes, some didn’t. But they all showed up daily. The community, the movement, the routine—it all worked together to keep them sharp and strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7416" data-end="7528"&gt;If your morning involves intentional movement, you’re stacking the odds in your favor for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7535" data-end="7569"&gt;8. Feel ready to face the day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7571" data-end="7763"&gt;Here’s one that’s less physical and more about energy and mood. If you wake up with enough mental drive to look forward to the day ahead—rather than dreading it—you’re doing something right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7765" data-end="7900"&gt;Morning vitality reflects both mental and physical well-being. Sleep quality, emotional health, and energy balance all converge here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7902" data-end="8113"&gt;Experts like Dr. Andrew Huberman highlight how early-day light exposure and &lt;a href="https://biologyinsights.com/andrew-huberman-articles-where-to-find-his-content/?.com"&gt;structured morning routines&lt;/a&gt; help regulate the nervous system, setting emotional tone and cognitive clarity for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8115" data-end="8399"&gt;And here’s the kicker: purpose plays into this too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8115" data-end="8399"&gt;A recent study published in the &lt;em data-start="84" data-end="126"&gt;American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; tracked over 13,000 adults aged 45+ for up to 15 years and found that those with a strong sense of purpose were &lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/this-simple-daily-habit-can-protect-the-brain-from-dementia/photostory/123518852.cms?.com"&gt;28% less likely to develop cognitive impairments like dementia&lt;/a&gt;, even after adjusting for education and genetic risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8115" data-end="8399"&gt;So if you’re waking up motivated, it’s not just mood—it’s a real health advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8406" data-end="8426"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8428" data-end="8583"&gt;Health over 65 isn’t about comparing yourself to twenty-year-olds—it’s about sustaining independence, energy, and clarity in the things that matter most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8585" data-end="8770"&gt;If you can get up, get dressed, move around, think clearly, make breakfast, use a bit of tech, stretch, and feel energized—all before noon—you’re not just doing fine. You’re thriving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8772" data-end="8817"&gt;And that, in my book, is the real top tier.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;In July, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dramatically, but quietly, scaled back a food safety surveillance system, cutting active tracking from eight top foodborne infections down to just two, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-quietly-scaled-back-surveillance-program-foodborne-illnesses-rcna227089"&gt;according to a report by NBC News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet)—a network of surveillance sites that spans 10 states and covers about 54 million Americans (16 percent of the US population)—previously included active monitoring for eight infections from pathogens. Those include &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/campylobacter/about/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cyclosporiasis/about/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyclospora&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/about/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Listeria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/general/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/about/"&gt;Shiga toxin-producing &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (STEC), &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shigella/about/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shigella&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vibrio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/yersinia/about/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yersinia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the network is only monitoring for STEC and &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A list of talking points the CDC sent the Connecticut health department (which is part of FoodNet) suggested that a lack of funding is behind the scaleback. "Funding has not kept pace with the resources required to maintain the continuation of FoodNet surveillance for all eight pathogens," the CDC document said, according to NBC. The Trump administration has made brutal cuts to federal agencies, including the CDC, which has lost hundreds of employees this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CDC spokesperson told the outlet that "Although FoodNet will narrow its focus to Salmonella and STEC, it will maintain both its infrastructure and the quality it has come to represent. Narrowing FoodNet’s reporting requirements and associated activities will allow FoodNet staff to prioritize core activities."&lt;/p&gt;

                Jerash mass grave site in the context of the First Pandemic. (A). Regions of aDNA isolated to date prior or at the First Pandemic are marked in dark brown (around First Pandemic). The Jerash site is marked by a star. The Eastern Roman Empire (indicated in dark red) historically documented the plague spreading from North Egypt and the Near East through Mediterranean regions. Yellow dots in dark brown regions denote the current available genetic evidence of Y. pestis recovered from Western European cemeteries. The single Tian Shan Hun Strain (yellow dot) in Central/Western Asia is hypothesized to be one of the early strains present prior to the onset of the Plague of Justinian. (B).

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, researchers have uncovered direct genomic evidence of the bacterium behind the Plague of Justinian—the world's first recorded pandemic—in the Eastern Mediterranean, where the outbreak was first described nearly 1,500 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;The discovery, led by an interdisciplinary team at the University of South Florida and Florida Atlantic University, with collaborators in India and Australia, identified Yersinia pestis, the microbe that causes plague, in a &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/mass+grave/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mass grave&lt;/a&gt; at the ancient city of Jerash, Jordan, near the pandemic's epicenter. The find definitively links the pathogen to the Justinian Plague marking the first pandemic (AD 541–750), resolving one of history's long-standing mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For centuries, historians have deliberated on what caused the devastating outbreak that killed tens of millions, reshaped the Byzantine Empire and altered the course of Western civilization. Despite circumstantial evidence, direct proof of the responsible microbe had remained elusive—a missing link in the story of pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two newly published papers led by USF and FAU provide these long-sought answers, offering new insight into one of the most consequential episodes in human history. The discovery, &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/16/8/926" target="_blank"&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Genes&lt;/i&gt;, also underscores plague's ongoing relevance today: while rare, Y. pestis continues to circulate worldwide. In July, a resident of northern Arizona died from &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/pneumonic+plague/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;pneumonic plague&lt;/a&gt;, the most lethal form of Y. pestis infection, marking the first such fatality in the U.S. since 2007, and just last week another individual in California tested positive for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;"This discovery provides the long-sought definitive proof of Y. pestis at the epicenter of the Plague of Justinian," said Rays H. Y. Jiang, Ph.D., lead PI of the studies and associate professor with the USF College of Public Health. "For centuries, we've relied on written accounts describing a devastating disease, but lacked any hard biological evidence of plague's presence. Our findings provide the missing piece of that puzzle, offering the first direct genetic window into how this pandemic unfolded at the heart of the empire."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Plague of Justinian first appeared in the historical record in Pelusium (present day Tell el-Farama) in Egypt before spreading throughout the Eastern Roman, or Byzantine, Empire. While traces of Y. pestis had previously been recovered thousands of miles away in small western European villages, no evidence had ever been found within the empire itself or near the heart of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Using targeted ancient DNA techniques, we successfully recovered and sequenced &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/genetic+material/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic material&lt;/a&gt; from eight human teeth excavated from burial chambers beneath the former Roman hippodrome in Jerash, a city just 200 miles from ancient Pelusium" said Greg O'Corry-Crowe, Ph.D., co-author and a research professor at FAU Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute and a National Geographic Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arena had been repurposed as a mass grave during the mid-sixth to early seventh century, when written accounts describe a sudden wave of mortality.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Genomic analysis revealed that the plague victims carried nearly identical strains of Y. pestis, confirming for the first time that the bacterium was present within the Byzantine Empire between AD 550-660. That genetic uniformity suggests a rapid, devastating outbreak consistent with historical descriptions of a plague causing mass death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Jerash site offers a rare glimpse of how ancient societies responded to public health disaster," said Jiang. "Jerash was one of the key cities of the Eastern Roman Empire, a documented trade hub with magnificent structures. That a venue once built for entertainment and civic pride became a mass cemetery in a time of emergency shows how urban centers were very likely overwhelmed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A companion study &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/14/8/797" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Pathogens&lt;/i&gt;, also led by USF and FAU, places the Jerash discovery into a wider evolutionary context. By analyzing hundreds of ancient and modern Y. pestis genomes—including those newly recovered from Jerash—the researchers showed that the bacteria had been circulating among human populations for millennia before the Justinian outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also found that later plague pandemics, from the Black Death of the 14th century to cases still appearing today, did not descend from a single ancestral strain. Instead, they arose independently and repeatedly from longstanding animal reservoirs, erupting in multiple waves across different regions and eras. This repeated pattern stands in stark contrast to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (COVID-19), which originated from a single spillover event and evolved primarily through human-to-human transmission.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Together, the findings reshape the understanding of how pandemics emerge, recur and spread, and why they remain a persistent feature of human civilization. The research underscores that pandemics are not singular historical catastrophes, but repeating biological events driven by human congregation, mobility and environmental change—themes that remain relevant today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This research was both scientifically compelling and personally resonant. It offered an extraordinary opportunity to delve into the study of human history through the lens of ancient DNA at a time when we ourselves were living through a global pandemic," said O'Corry-Crowe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Equally profound was the experience of working with ancient human remains—individuals who lived, suffered, and died centuries ago—and using modern science to help recover and share their stories. It's a humbling reminder of our shared humanity across time and a moving testament to the power of science to give voice to those long silent."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While very different from COVID-19, both diseases highlight the enduring link between connectivity and pandemic risk, as well as the reality that some pathogens can never be fully eradicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've been wrestling with plague for a few thousand years and people still die from it today," said Jiang. "Like COVID, it continues to evolve, and containment measures evidently can't get rid of it. We have to be careful, but the threat will never go away."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on the Jerash breakthrough, the team is now expanding its research to Venice, Italy and the Lazaretto Vecchio, a dedicated quarantine island and one the world's most significant plague burial sites. More than 1,200 samples from this Black Death-era mass grave are now housed at USF, offering an unprecedented opportunity to study how early public health measures intersected with pathogen evolution, urban vulnerability and cultural memory.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to boost brain power, from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-boost-linked-to-exercise-can-last-several-years-scientists-find"&gt;exercising more often&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-training-may-not-work-but-there-is-a-way-to-boost-your-cognition"&gt;learning new skills.&lt;/a&gt; But what about boosting the actual size of your brain?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a new study, wearing the right kind of perfume or cologne can enlarge your brain's gray matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Kyoto University and the University of Tsukuba in Japan asked 28 women to wear a specific rose scent oil on their clothing for a month, with another 22 volunteers enlisted &lt;a href="https://bioivt.com/blogs/control-matrices"&gt;as controls&lt;/a&gt; who put on plain water instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="172160" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt; ( &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="172160" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt;) scans showed boosts in the gray matter volume of the rose scent participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While an increase in brain volume doesn't necessarily translate into more thinking power, the findings could have implications for neurodegenerative conditions such as dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprise-link-between-menthol-and-alzheimers-found-in-mice"&gt;Surprise Link Between Menthol And Alzheimer's Found in Mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study is the first to show that continuous scent inhalation changes brain structure," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainresbull.2024.110896"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've seen scents like this &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2023.1200448"&gt;improve memory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-function-dramatically-boosted-by-certain-fragrances-during-sleep"&gt;cognitive performance&lt;/a&gt;, but here the team wanted to try a longer-term experiment to see how triggering our sense of smell might lead to measurable changes in brain structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172164" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172164" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainDiagram.jpg" alt="Brain diagram" class="wp-image-172164 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainDiagram.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainDiagram-593x415.jpg 593w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainDiagram-600x420.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172164" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers compared changes in the amount of gray matter tissue in specific areas of the brain. (Kokubun et al, &lt;em&gt;Brain Res. Bull.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While overall gray matter increased, the difference varied by region. There was little change in the amygdala (where emotions are managed) or in the orbitofrontal cortex (where nice smells are processed). But there was significantly more gray matter in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_cingulate_cortex"&gt;posterior cingulate cortex&lt;/a&gt; or PCC (linked to memory and association).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-83621-2"&gt;Previous studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that in people who have problems with their olfactory system, the amygdala (directly linked to smell) is less active, while the posterior cingulate cortex (indirectly linked to smell) is more active. The brain overcompensates, in a way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest something similar might be happening here. The amygdala doesn't have to keep alerting the brain to the rose scent, because it's always there – but the posterior cingulate cortex has to continually process it and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brains-memory-center-never-stops-making-neurons-study-confirms"&gt;store related memories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The PCC is involved in memory-odor associations, odor memory retrieval, and semantic memory processes," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainresbull.2024.110896"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The PCC, which processes odor memories, was more activated than the amygdala, which is responsible for sensing odors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it's difficult to pin down exactly what's causing this &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/bilingual-brains-have-higher-volume-of-grey-matter-study-suggests"&gt;boost in gray matter&lt;/a&gt;. Another possibility raised by the researchers is that the rose scent is actually labeled as unpleasant by the brain, with the subsequent emotional regulation responsible for the PCC working harder and increasing in size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope that the findings could be useful in the development of aromatherapies that boost mental health and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/some-layers-of-your-brain-actually-get-stronger-as-you-age"&gt;brain plasticity&lt;/a&gt;. Adding a scent to clothing would be just like wearing perfume or aftershave – a cheap, easy to potentially benefit the health of your brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further down the line, with further testing on different types of scents and bigger groups of people, the discoveries here could even be used to reduce the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PCC is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pscychresns.2015.01.018"&gt;known to shrink&lt;/a&gt; in people with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="172160" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease, and keeping it stimulated with fragrances could be a way of keeping this part of the brain active and functioning well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Therefore, the result of the current study suggests that continuous inhalation of rose essential oil may prevent brain atrophy and prevent dementia," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainresbull.2024.110896"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainresbull.2024.110896"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brain Research Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Adherence stayed high throughout the 3 month window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shifts in the gut community did not upend overall diversity. Instead, a few taxa moved in meaningful ways that are biologically plausible for fiber fermenters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prebiotic group scored higher on a combined cognition factor and made fewer errors on the &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-international-neuropsychological-society/article/paired-associate-performance-in-the-early-detection-of-dat/1AFD16E84A939D43AD0A5BF100CDF8AD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PAL test,&lt;/a&gt; a visual paired associated task sensitive to early Alzheimer’s related change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pattern fits with decades of work showing PAL detects subtle episodic memory problems before many standard clinic scales do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are excited to see these changes in just 12 weeks. This holds huge promise for enhancing &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-brain-map-shows-how-rhythms-instantly-reconfigure-your-mind-freq-ness/"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; health and memory in our ageing population,” said Dr. Lochlainn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specific test improvement matters because paired associates learning taps the ability to form new connections between locations and patterns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is a core function that erodes early in Alzheimer’s, so even small gains on this task are notable in people over 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-did-not-change"&gt;What did not change&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The supplement did not improve chair rise time or other muscle strength measures over 12 weeks. That result held even though everyone received protein and was encouraged to perform simple resistance exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short interventions often struggle to move physical outcomes in older adults. The authors acknowledge the window may have been too brief to remodel muscle while still being long enough to nudge &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/recreational-cannabis-use-protects-against-cognitive-decline/"&gt;cognition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These plant fibres, which are cheap and available over the counter, could benefit a wide group of people in these cash strapped times. They are safe and acceptable too,” said Professor Claire Steves, senior author at King’s College London. She added that larger and longer trials are the next step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gut-brain-link-fits-the-data"&gt;Gut-brain link fits the data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gut microbes create short chain fatty acids, neurotransmitter precursors, and other metabolites that signal along nerves and through the immune system. Reviews outline how this axis shapes learning and memory, especially as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aging itself alters microbial communities and the barriers that keep inflammation in check. Those shifts ripple into brain circuits involved in attention, processing speed, and memory consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber fermenters like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4908950/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/a&gt; thrive on inulin and fructooligosaccharides, producing metabolites tied to synaptic plasticity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That biochemical context helps explain why cognition moved while muscle metrics did not in a 3 month trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-read-these-results"&gt;How to read these results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This RCT used a strong within family control, a clear intervention, and validated cognitive outcomes. It also kept participants engaged through a fully remote setup that reduces travel barriers for older volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, the cohort was modest and mostly female, and the findings apply to healthy older adults rather than people with diagnosed dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statistics say cognition moved, but the study was not designed to tell us whether daily functioning changed in a measurable way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet, medications, and baseline microbiomes differ from person to person. That reality suggests responses to the same fiber dose may vary, a point future work should tackle with larger samples and longer follow up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-this-could-go-next"&gt;Where this could go next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A practical next step is to compare different fiber types, doses, and durations head to head in older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also need to test whether early cognitive gains persist at 6 or 12 months and whether they translate into fewer &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-molecules-unexpectedly-store-their-own-memory/"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; slips in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mechanistic work can help map which metabolites rise with supplementation and which brain networks respond. Remote designs, as shown here, make those studies more feasible and inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The safe profile and accessibility of these fibers lower the barrier to rigorous testing in community settings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unanswered question is not whether the gut talks to the brain, it is how best to tune that conversation for lasting cognitive benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46116-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 18:33:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxQU1M2b05Cd3RMay1OOEFXeGtYdjJobFRqZ0ZnR3JmQ25hcTVZemVHWjliRF90UlJabjVMa2dtdEVZWHRCS3VnMXVRZ2RxVzFhRHJIcHc3SGRTUlVPT01VQ2UzaWNjeTBQU0Q5bDBoUGNkSThFLXMxbllWN3o5d2YzZk05dGlfMkd2YmNWbm1KSDhzU3JBdzgyaTg5RkhSZURDOFpodlFwQVRKeWpsX25tWV9tTlFzRXZ1MzNLMjZwVGw0dU9uVGF3</guid></item><item><title>我的姻亲在来访时总是向我们提供具体的优惠。他们从来没有让我们把它们拿上去。-石板</title><link>https://slate.com/advice/2025/08/parenting-advice-uninterested-grandparents-visit.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeuae13t000b3b7af7tor5h6@published"&gt;My in-laws live a four-hour flight away but visit us five to six times a year. They’re both retired and enjoy traveling. My husband and I are parents to their only grandchildren, and they &lt;em&gt;claim&lt;/em&gt; they love spending time with them. But their behavior shows otherwise, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="139" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeuag8p100103b7afqim0la2@published"&gt;Their visits typically revolve around concerts, so they have a number of nights out while they stay with us. This is usually fine, but when they decide to see their favorite bands’ multiple east coast tour stops, we feel like our apartment is a convenient, free Airbnb for them. It seems like seeing their grandchildren is not their actual priority. They also don’t really play with the kids; they just like to observe them. My son is about to turn 5 and he’s now questioning why Grandma and Grandpa “only like to look at him.” We had a second child last summer and they similarly like to watch her play. They offer to babysit, but I think it’s mostly so they can say they offered—when we’ve tried to take them up on it, they say they can’t do it.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="106" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeuae22k000c3b7a8hf9lfia@published"&gt;Their next visit is coming up. I thought they were coming for my son’s birthday, but we just found out they plan to leave early in the morning on his birthday, before any of us are awake. My son knows they’re coming but doesn’t know their departure plans yet, and l know he’ll be upset that they won’t actually be here to celebrate with him. We’re both struggling with how to tell our son his grandparents are sneaking away at dawn on his birthday in a way that doesn’t vilify them. We’re pretty annoyed with their travel plans and have voiced our displeasure to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;

I want to emphasize that you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have the power to put a stop to their frequent stays—your house is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an Airbnb, however they treat it, and you do not actually have to let them stay with you every time.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="231" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeuae22p000g3b7aoxc9hka4@published"&gt;For all the complaining some people do when their hopes of having grandchildren are dashed, there seem to be plenty of people who just don’t seem terribly interested in the role of grandparent. But there are also people who just aren’t very good at it, sometimes because it’s been a long time since they spent much time with young children. I’m not trying to defend your in-laws, because they do seem to be freely using your house as their free vacation lodging, but if their grandparent failings are compounded by their awkwardness with your son, you (or better yet, your husband) can try to facilitate more interaction next time they come to see you. When my kids were small and spent 90 percent of their day reading, playing games, building towers, serving pretend meals, etc. on the living room floor, our relatives learned they probably needed to be on the kids’ level if they wanted to interact with them. You can be ready to point out your kids’ favorite games and books and crafts etc. to ease everyone into playtime. Yes, this is kind of annoying, but if you do it and it still doesn’t work, at least you’ll know you tried everything you could. Ultimately, it’s up to your in-laws to build a relationship with their grandson; you are not and can’t be responsible for it in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeuae243000h3b7avo2k1hpp@published"&gt;As for what to tell your son about this upcoming visit, I don’t see any benefit to sharing your irritation with him or using language like “sneaking away at dawn.” All you need to say is that Grandma and Grandpa have to go home on his birthday. See if your in-laws can celebrate with him in some way a day or two before, maybe with some pre-birthday cake or ice cream. I hope they at least know enough to bring a gift for him to open.&lt;/p&gt;

I confessed to my husband that I was worried she would hate me like I hate my mother. Let me clarify: I love my mother, but she and I are different in ways that keep us apart and similar in ways that drive us crazy. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/12/becoming-own-mother-parenting-daughter-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;I know this is true for most mother-daughter relationships. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;'Alcohol is a very toxic drug, it not only increases the risk of cancer, especially in women, that's breast cancer, but it also increases the risk of heart disease,' Dr. Levine explained (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Try not to listen above 60 percent of volume,' he warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And, finally, the last two habits he recommended that young people stop were drinking alcohol and participating in recreational drug use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cocaine or fentanyl is like playing Russian roulette with a loaded gun, with your life,' he warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it's not only cocaine that has the potential to cause damage.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Levine states that smoking marijuana can 'reduce cognitive ability,' and can be bad for your lungs and heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At number five, alcohol,' he concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Alcohol is a very toxic drug, it not only increases the risk of cancer, especially in women, that's breast cancer, but it also increases the risk of heart disease,' Dr. Levine explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's responsible for lots of accidents.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeu7eme500123b7ai5ao92cq@published"&gt;I’m a 44-year-old man and I’ve been married to a 45-year-old woman for the past 15 years. About six years ago, she told me that she was basically done with sex. While we have had sex maybe 10 times or so since then, her statement has been essentially true. She was never particularly sexual anyway (she never communicated about likes/dislikes, fantasies, masturbation, etc.) and didn’t feel like physical intimacy was important to her.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="203" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeu7emfm00133b7ayrgpz0yk@published"&gt;While I do not feel the same way, I have been, and continue to be, willing to continue our marriage this way. But here is my question: Through recent avid reading of this column, I have learned quite a bit regarding the spectrum of sexuality and have come to strongly believe that my wife is some version of asexual. In retrospect, I think she probably always has been. I don’t think that she spends much time thinking about her own sexuality beyond it being something she can live without. I have started wondering, though, if pushing her to think about it in a bit more self-reflective way and potentially coming to a conclusion/labeling it would be helpful for my own mental health and confidence in the relationship. Even if it is what I already suspect, I can’t help but think that “knowing” it to be true (and to some extent her “admitting” it’s true) would help our relationship.  I am fully aware that this would be entirely for me, as, again, I am nearly positive she does not think about this in any type of self-reflective way. So what do you think? Discuss this with her to ease my own mind, or just maintain the status quo?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeu7emjx00163b7ak6k3giq2@published"&gt;Given the mores of millennials and Gen Z, it may be unfashionable to hold this opinion, but I believe labels can help everyone. They are shortcuts to understanding human complexity. Granted, they should be used with the tacit understanding that they can be imprecise and certainly do not describe everything (even about the qualities they are highlighting), and thus are often limiting. But in terms of conveying a rough understanding of something like a person’s sexuality, they can be quite useful for orienting not only the labelee but the people around them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="155" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeu7emlg00173b7a8250kko5@published"&gt;Let’s take your situation as an example: Your wife describing herself as asexual would help you understand the reasons behind the dearth of sex in your relationship. It could help you refrain from taking said lack of sex personally, help you not see it as an evaluation of your performance or attractiveness. In other words, it would confirm it’s not you, it’s her. However, since you already suspect that your wife is on the ace spectrum, as it would explain so much, you should ask yourself why confirmation is important to you. Is there, for example, lingering doubt about other potential reasons why your wife is done with sex? Are you just big on formal decrees of one’s personhood? Knowing this about yourself will be useful, as any persistence on your part in attempting to coax out a declaration of your wife’s perceived asexuality will likely prompt the question, “Why do you want to know?”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="159" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeu7emmy00183b7au5j2oct1@published"&gt;I don’t think there is anything wrong with having a conversation that begins somewhere around, “Do you think you might be asexual?” Even if it is for you, communication, particularly on something as important as your partner’s sexuality, is a good thing. But you should be prepared to receive her where she is. You can’t &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; her dissect parts of herself that she cannot reach or is otherwise not interested in reaching. That is to say: Don’t push her. Have the conversation and see where it goes. If she denies it and you aren’t convinced, you can tell her that and why. Perhaps follow up by purchasing one of the excellent books on asexuality that have been published in the last few years, like Angela Chen’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ace-Asexuality-Reveals-Identity-Meaning-ebook/dp/B07Y7H1WT9/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2ATH53V9MSN2K&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.kUEjXggB_7ggqNfz6k5l9Ci0fubTz7JypNJkOd07epL0sms16ithw1xQUbZGopKlT3BP7_9S80EiVsbhXyvg-EdTkOgo8lsIoYXN0HxbwRs.4aGk6tzkjd_glgqrbPwJ86MZ_ym1HHMVlAQg9Q6-bH0&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=ace+angela+chen&amp;amp;qid=1756130574&amp;amp;sprefix=ace+angela,aps,183&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ace: What Asexuality Reveals About Desire, Society, and the Meaning of Sex&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and/or Cody Daigle-Orians’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Am-Ace-Advice-Living-Asexual/dp/1839972629/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1IM4OFX5HJOHB&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.dFHyODVV9BOQqahOJZybQOPJFzdw4W94nMCP5Cv-cdW2ogwqsoWhbmUjr8KSzO4PcODiHjX4EIK06uNlzb453dusb7X-bbIdpQunV2Hdwno.Zdk_QtS6469LzkyC6pjR9m8mpY3NXLOnjYl24qaeNt0&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=cody+daigle-orians&amp;amp;qid=1756130601&amp;amp;sprefix=cody+da,aps,890&amp;amp;sr=8-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Am Ace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeu8n6jf002v3b7aryminm8z@published"&gt;My boyfriend has difficulty coming. When it does come out, it doesn’t shoot. It just kind of dribbles for about a minute. He’s only 32 and not experiencing any pain, but I’ve never had any guy I’ve ever been with have this sort of issue. I’ve suggested that he see a urologist, but he waves it off, saying it’s been like this for him for the last three years and he’s fine. Should I insist?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="195" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeu8n6jf002y3b7alk2xa204@published"&gt;There are guys who come a lot and those who don’t, and this is often just a matter of general human variance with no bearing on overall health. But here’s what grabbed me in your letter: Your boyfriend saw a change in his overall output some three years ago. Again, it could be nothing, but it’s always best to make sure that any changes we see in the body aren’t the result of an underlying condition. Weak ejaculation (or perceived ejaculate volume reduction) &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mens-health/weak-ejaculation#ejaculation-conditions"&gt;may indicate nerve damage&lt;/a&gt; caused by conditions like diabetes or multiple sclerosis. It could be the product of medicine or other factors like stress. Similarly, delayed ejaculation could be the result of &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/delayed-ejaculation/symptoms-causes/syc-20371358"&gt;hormonal conditions or neurological diseases&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes changes like those your boyfriend has observed within himself are benign. Sometimes they amount to our bodies sending us messages. My advice is to always keep your line open for when your body calls with something to say. So yes, I think it would be wise for your boyfriend to see a doctor just in case. It’s much better to rule out something more serious than to be unaware that something grave is afoot.&lt;/p&gt;

But it seems that this &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; bothering him, if his laissez-faire response to you about his dick dribble is any indication. How to make him care? Pointing out that an underlying condition may be at the root of this might inspire action on his part. But ultimately, you can’t make him care about anything. That’s on him. Hopefully, inspiration will kick in well before an actual issue presents itself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeu8n6jh00343b7apk9ae6gt@published"&gt;This is a pretty simple case of cause and effect.  Part of what inspired your husband to seek out testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) was his low sex drive. And TRT delivered his sex drive, as it’s &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5649360/"&gt;known&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37589949/"&gt;do&lt;/a&gt;.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="81" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeu8n6jh00353b7alam3cqrg@published"&gt;Unless his sex drive becomes so distracting that it impacts his obligations/daily life, I don’t think this is much of a problem. Swing by when you can, but otherwise, leave him to his own devices, of which he now owns several. It seems like he’s doing what he needs to do with his libido boost. If he is unsatisfied with the results, he should talk to his doctor. But something tells me that he’s currently thrilled enough for both of you.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.inovanewsroom.org/press-release/2025/08/groundbreaking-inova-study-finds-potential-link-between-long-distance-running-and-colon-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; shows a potential link between extreme endurance exercise and increased risk of advanced colon cancer in younger adults, according to research at Inova Schar Cancer Institute, in Fairfax, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tim Cannon, a medical oncologist, told WTOP after examining several young endurance runners under the age of 40 who had advanced colon cancer, he hypothesized that prolonged stress on the gut during long-distance running may trigger cancer-causing mutations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study of 100 adults between the ages of 35 and 50, who had run five or more marathons or two or more ultramarathons, Cannon found 15% of the participants had advanced adenomas, which are precancerous lesions, compared to the expected 1% to 2% in non-runners in this age range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, 41% had at least one adenoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The normal risk in the 35 to 50 population would be one-fifth of those numbers,” Cannon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average age of the participants was 42.5 year old — two and half years before the recommended age of 45, for a first screening colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The reason we all get colonoscopies, or we should all get colonoscopies, when we turn 45, is because if we remove a polyp or adenoma before it becomes cancerous, then we’re likely going to be safe from cancer,” Cannon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An often-ignored warning sign for endurance athletes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannon said long distance runners, and many of their physicians, have downplayed bleeding after a run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s very common among long distance runners, and it’s often been called ‘runner’s colitis,'” Cannon said. “The slang is ‘runners’ trots.'”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People have assumed that ‘runner’s colitis’ is a benign entity, so they’ve been saying ‘It’s normal for runners to bleed.’ And the reason I know this, is because that’s what these runners who have cancer are telling me,” Cannon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannon said blood in the stool, for runners or any person, should be checked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most common presenting symptom for someone with colon cancer is blood in their stool,” Cannon said. “That’s the most common reason we learn someone has polyps or cancer is because they’re bleeding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannon said further research is underway, in examining this possible link. However, there could be other reasons extreme endurance athletes seem at risk of developing colon cancer at younger age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It could be the runners’ diets. It could be other aspects of their lifestyle that they have in common. It could be they drink from bottles with BPA or some other carcinogen more often than regular people,” who don’t engage in similar long-distance activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Cannon hopes that this preliminary study will prompt runners to get screening colonoscopies before the age of 45.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do think that it should raise awareness that any bleeding from a runner is a reason get a colonoscopy,  and not something to be ignored,” Cannon said. “Exercise is good, overall — please don’t use this as an excuse not to exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;

Cottage cheese with fruit is the answer. Cottage cheese is creamy and satisfying all on its own, bu&lt;strong&gt;t pairing it with fruit adds fiber, nutrients and a touch of natural sweetness&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, cottage cheese’s mild, slightly tangy flavor complements all kinds of fruit — from juicy stone-fruits to crisp apples to sweet tropical varieties. With endless options, you can keep it seasonal or simply follow your cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the health benefits of cottage cheese?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/328841/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:USDA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;, just ⅔ cup of 2% cottage cheese serves up 151 mg of calcium (about 15% of the average adult's &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/calcium.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:daily calcium needs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;daily calcium needs&lt;/a&gt; between age 19 and 50) and a solid 16 grams of protein. The result? A nutrient-dense win for both bones and muscles. It’s also rich in &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Phosphorus-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:phosphorus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;phosphorus&lt;/a&gt;, an essential mineral that supports strong, healthy bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Protein is a macronutrient that can be tricky to get enough of since it often requires planning and cooking,” explains &lt;a href="https://amydavisrd.com/recipes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amy Davis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amy Davis&lt;/a&gt;, RDN, a New Orleans-based dietitian. “Cottage cheese is an easy way to add it to your diet.

Try pairing it with kiwi, suggests Davis. “The tiny seeds add a light crunch that balances out the creaminess and for even more texture, you can sprinkle on some granola,” she says. “Kiwi is one of the most underrated fruits. It’s a vitamin C powerhouse — just two give you &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6267416/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:100% of your daily needs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;100% of your daily needs&lt;/a&gt; — and it’s high in fiber.

If the hard nub at the end comes off easily with your fingers, it’s ready; if you need a knife, it’s not quite there yet. For extra fiber, Davis also recommends keeping the skin on — just rinse and scrub well before eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/g64815628/fruits-high-in-magnesium/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:9 Fruits That Are High In Magnesium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;9 Fruits That Are High In Magnesium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Magda Tymczyj - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mango&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mango is another sweet, juicy tropical favorite that pairs well with mild, creamy cottage cheese. &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/2710833/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Loaded with immune-boosting vitamins and minerals;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Loaded with immune-boosting vitamins and minerals&lt;/a&gt; like vitamin A, vitamin C, folate, potassium, copper, and magnesium, it’s as healthy as it is delicious.

Choosing organic helps cut down on exposure to synthetic pesticides and added hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Look for simple ingredients like milk, cream, salt and live cultures, which are great for gut health. Steer clear of additives and artificial flavors, which don’t add any real nutrition and can sometimes upset your stomach,” says Mabashov. “Also, check the protein and aim for at least 12 to 14 grams per half cup.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to fat content, it’s really a personal choice that depends on your dietary requirements and goals. “Full-fat (4%) can be more satiating, contain more fat-soluble vitamins and keep blood sugar stable, whereas low-fat (2%) can be a good balance of creaminess and lighter calories,” explains Mabashov. “Fat-free often tastes chalky and may have extra stabilizers to make up for the texture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing to keep in mind: Cottage cheese is naturally higher in sodium. If you’re watching your heart health or blood pressure, look for lower sodium options — Mabashov recommends aiming for less than 300 milligrams of sodium per half cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Westend61&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 16:32:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE10N1V1UGxBQXlIaE1nbHhDd0ZMN2UwbjV1M2djZVFuZjlkXzZPeDl0ZFZLcTVPejh1NTJtdG4ydFBEMW4wNlVhUWRBZm1uUnFJLVlrUVMtVmJobWt6NFNFSTZ3WE1JWkptOU9CXzhxMnRhdk1VNkNuTVRB</guid></item><item><title>部分心脏移植显示出希望-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/27/well/partial-heart-transplants.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 15:13:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE4zX3ZGVzIyYzJ2Vnh0U0l2ampwVV9fNnVwbVZQeHl6cnp6SXEzQ0JuT0thdlBIcjQ0cmxtV1hlb3J4RnItbGUtbmVpRl83RFNaazdsbkNjN256ZzNEbVVjTHVfM3NVUlBLMWl5SzRxdkVwZ2hEOW54MEZn</guid></item><item><title>新的人工智能模型挑战多发性硬化症的分类方式-今日多发性硬化症新闻</title><link>https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2025/08/20/nat-medicine-ai-driven-reclassification-of-multiple-sclerosis-progression/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new model using artificial intelligence (AI) suggests that &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS) progression is better viewed along a single disease spectrum, rather than as distinct disease types — such as those now used in MS diagnosis and treatment — according to a study led by scientists in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global research team says moving to this view could ultimately lead to better disease management for people with MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our data clearly show that MS cannot be characterized by subtypes such as relapsing or progressive MS, but is instead a continuous disease process with definable state transitions,” Heinz Wiendl, MD, a professor at the University of Freiburg and one of the study’s senior authors, said in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-08-ai-redefines-multiple-sclerosis-continuum.html"&gt;university news story&lt;/a&gt; outlining the study’s findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Instead of categorizing [MS] patients, we should quantify their state and track it dynamically,” said Wiendl, a neurologist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03901-6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;AI-driven reclassification of multiple sclerosis progression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In MS, the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy parts of the brain and spinal cord. The neurodegenerative disease is categorized into three main &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/4-types-ms/"&gt;types&lt;/a&gt; based on its clinical presentation, meaning the symptoms seen among patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-rrms/"&gt;Relapsing-remitting MS&lt;/a&gt; (RRMS) is characterized by &lt;a href="http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-flares/"&gt;relapses&lt;/a&gt;, or periods in which symptoms worsen, interspersed with periods of remission, where symptoms ease or go away entirely. It is thought to be largely driven by inflammatory activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progressive MS is marked by symptoms that steadily worsen over time, with neurodegeneration that happens even without relapses or signs of active inflammation. In &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/primary-progressive-multiple-sclerosis-ppms/"&gt;primary progressive MS&lt;/a&gt; (PPMS), this progression starts right from disease onset, whereas &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/secondary-progressive-multiple-sclerosis-spms/"&gt;secondary progressive MS&lt;/a&gt; (SPMS) follows RRMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Disease type now determines treatment strategies for patients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These classifications are used to determine treatment strategies and predict prognosis. However, evidence suggests that the distinctions may not be so clear-cut — and that they may have limited value for predicting the disease course and treatment responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This raises the important question of whether the current MS categorization into distinct subtypes is justified or whether MS would be better described as a disease continuum from a focal inflammatory to a progressive disease course,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, the scientists used an AI-based approach to develop a new MS classification system that would be independent of the diagnosed disease type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They built the AI model using data from more than 8,000 people with RRMS, SPMS, or PPMS who were included in a large Novartis-sponsored clinical trial database. The data came from nine Phase 2/3 clinical trials, and covered up to 15 years of follow-up, with approximately 120,000 neurological assessments and more than 35,000 &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-mri-preparation/"&gt;MRI scans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;[Emerging evidence] raises the important question of whether the current MS categorization into distinct subtypes is justified or whether MS would be better described as a disease continuum from a focal inflammatory to a progressive disease course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers identified four aspects of MS that best capture its progression: physical disability, brain damage, clinical relapses, and silent inflammatory activity seen on MRI scans.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These variables were used to build a model that gives a probabilistic assessment of how likely people with MS are to transition between eight distinct disease states over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This included states 1-3, which are early phases of clinical stability with minimal disability, and stage 4, or asymptomatic MRI disease activity. State 5 corresponds to a clinical relapse, and states 6-8 are phases of advanced MS in which there’s less inflammation but greater neurodegeneration and disability. States 4 and 5 were both considered intermediate inflammatory stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to this framework, patients don’t have to move linearly through these states. Instead, they can transition in any order or direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the data indicated that it’s nearly impossible for a person to progress directly to advanced stages without first experiencing some type of intermediate inflammatory activity. Further, once patients are in advanced stages, they won’t return to an early clinically stable phase, the data indicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As most people diagnosed with either SPMS or PPMS were considered to be in advanced stages, the data don’t support distinguishing between the two entities, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;AI-based model now must be tested in clinical practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AI approach was then validated using data from a separate clinical trial and real-world databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the model was accurate in predicting a person’s risk of transitioning to advanced MS, according to the researchers. Data also showed that treatment with an MS &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/treatments-that-modify-the-disease-course/"&gt;disease-modifying therapy&lt;/a&gt; increases the odds that a person will stay in early, mild disease stages for longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings support a new way of describing MS, the team noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our … model results are more compatible with the view of MS as a disease continuum than with the traditional view of distinct [types],” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, scientists hope this new framework will help patients access treatment more easily. The currently used classification system limits which patients can access DMTs, as most are indicated for relapsing disease types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the new system were to be adopted, it would allow for treatment to be initiated based on individual risk assessment, regardless of the diagnosed disease type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Patients with active but clinically silent inflammatory activity, in particular, require early treatment decisions, as the model strikingly demonstrates,” the news story noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the model needs to be tested in clinical practice to see how useful it is for making MS treatment decisions in real-world settings, according to the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;AI model could have implications beyond MS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lutz Hein, MD, who is not one of the study’s authors but serves as dean of the faculty of medicine at the University of Freiburg, noted that the idea behind this AI model — to move past rigid disease categorizations — also has implications beyond MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The principle is fundamental and pioneering—and it can also be applied to many other diseases, both within neurology and beyond,” Hein said.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;The old adage “ignorance is bliss” feels especially fitting when it comes to healthcare. In fact, new research reveals that one in three people avoids—or is likely to avoid—medical information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/abm/article/59/1/kaaf058/8229759?login=true"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the Annals of Behavioral Medicine earlier this month, researchers investigated data from 92 studies involving 564,497 participants from 25 countries. Despite the fact that successful treatment often depends on early detection, their results indicate that many people are reluctant to engage in preventive care or checkups. These first-of-their-kind global estimates carry significant implications for health policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Avoidance highest for Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Medical information is more accessible than ever, but many people choose to avoid it,” the researchers wrote in the study. “We found that nearly 1 in 3 people avoided or were likely to avoid medical information.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People were most likely to avoid information about incurable neurodegenerative diseases—41% for Alzheimer’s and 40% for Huntington’s. Avoidance dropped slightly for serious but treatable conditions like HIV (32%) and cancer (29%) and was lowest for chronic, manageable illnesses like diabetes, at 24%.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers described medical information avoidance as “any behavior designed to prevent or delay the acquisition of available but potentially unwanted information,” such as delaying or missing doctor’s appointments and refusing medical tests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While one might suggest that a lack of information or high financial costs are to blame, the study includes Germany. There, health insurance companies communicate appropriate services to their members and usually cover the expenses. Unfortunately, however, the study did not allow for the direct comparisons of information avoidance between countries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“One possibility is that the choice not to know is a deliberate one,” Ralph Hertwig, co-author of the study and director of the Center for Adaptive Rationality at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, said in an institute &lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/25246796/avoidance-of-information-about-own-health"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “We have investigated this phenomenon—which we call deliberate ignorance—in other areas of life and found that there are a wide variety of reasons for it.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Why do people avoid information about their health?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team identified 16 key predictors of this avoidance. Interestingly, these did not include gender, race, or ethnicity. The most significant predictors were feeling overwhelmed, low confidence in managing one’s health, the fear of being judged, and mistrust and lack of confidence in the medical system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Patterns of avoidance varied across world regions, suggesting that differences in healthcare systems may influence behavior,” the researchers explained in the paper, adding that they did not investigate how medical information avoidance impacts patients’ health. “More research is needed to understand the psychological and medical consequences of avoiding medical information.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In fact, the team highlights that their research does not judge if medical information avoidance is positive or negative—it reveals that the behavior is common and not always irrational. Furthermore, the identified avoidance predictors highlight potential areas for policy interventions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, “our findings suggest that lower trust is associated with higher information avoidance,” lead study author Konstantin Offer, a predoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, said in the statement. “Restoring trust in the medical system could therefore lead to greater engagement with medical information.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In other words, if you dread attending checkups or learning your medical test results, you’re far from being the only one, since many people avoid it altogether. But it remains to be seen how this avoidance might impact people’s health.&lt;/p&gt;

Over a whole lifetime, a person’s chromosomes may appear more frayed because the cells have replicated so many times, scientists said. The authors also looked for anti-aging effects of fatty acids, but that part of the study found “no significant effect.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The biggest discovery came when researchers saw that the chromosomes of people who took daily vitamin D3 pills appeared younger than those of the control group, said study author JoAnn Manson. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It was intriguing that we found that vitamin D supplementation did protect against a key pathway of biological aging,” said Manson, a medical professor at Harvard and Brigham and Women’s Hospital.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Specifically, protective caps on the ends of chromosomes — which have long been known to shorten with age — measured longer at the end of the study in the vitamin D3 group, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002916525002552?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002916525002552?via%3Dihub"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The shortening of the protective caps, called telomeres, is an “aging biomarker” that signals someone is more prone to inflammation and disease, Manson said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Shorter telomeres lead the entire X-shaped chromosome to deteriorate with age, “which increases risks for chronic diseases, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and overall mortality,” the study said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Michael Holick, a national expert on vitamin D, said the study’s findings are consistent with other research showing people with insufficient vitamin D3 levels are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, and even infectious diseases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“These data are very supportive of the fact that it definitely improves health outcomes,” said Holick, a professor at the Boston University School of Medicine who was not involved in the study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;On average, study participants who took daily vitamin D3 for four years had telomere lengths consistent with only one year of aging&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;over that period, the study found. The telomeres of participants in the placebo group had average lengths consistent with four years of aging, scientists said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Over four years, there was protection against three years of biological aging through that pathway of telomere shortening, which was an intriguing finding,” Manson said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Importantly, the study findings do not trump what doctors and scientists have long told patients about naturally occurring forms of vitamin D, Manson said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Most importantly, we are recommending that people try to follow a healthy diet that’s high in fruits, vegetables, and whole foods, and really minimize processed and ultra-processed foods,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Vitamin D supplements will never outweigh the positive biological effects of healthy diet and exercise regimens, which provide the human body with sufficient vitamin D, Manson said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We do believe that a healthy diet healthy lifestyle are paramount and will never be replaced by popping any pill,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Still, the study findings are important because they provide some proof that supplementing vitamin D intake in the winter months can have benefits at the cellular level, Manson said. People who have chronic conditions that prevent them from eating certain vitamin D-rich foods can also use vitamin D pills to effectively fill a nutritional gap, she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It’s quite reasonable, as a form of insurance to take 1,000 to 2,000 IUs a day if you have concerns about getting adequate intake from the diet or time spent outdoors,” Manson said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Holick, who is known for discovering the major form of vitamin D that circulates in human blood, said he recommends his patients take at least 2,000 IUs of vitamin D3 daily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The data is very clear — if you are vitamin D deficient, you’re at more increased risk of mortality,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

Without it, our focus softens, our experience of the world blurs, and our identities melt away. But as people age, their memory declines. Many billions of dollars have been spent to understand the biological basis of dementia and to devise a cure. In most cases, they have failed spectacularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if, rather than study the brains of people with advanced memory loss, we instead studied the brains of people with the opposite condition: extraordinary memory and brain health in old age?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past few decades, Sandra Weintraub, a scientist at Northwestern University, has been part of a team studying the brains of “super-agers,” people 80 and older who have the memory ability of people in their 50s. In a new paper published this year to considerable fanfare, she found that super-agers didn’t have much in common. They didn’t share a diet, or an exercise regimen, or a set of maladies or medications. One thing, however, united them: their social relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s guest is Sandra Weintraub. We talk about the science of memory and the brain and the protective benefit of social connection for our minds and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wysiwyg extended-description" data-sentry-component="Wysiwyg" data-sentry-source-file="wysiwyg.tsx"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the following excerpt, Sandra Weintraub explains to Derek how she got into the field of memory and aging research and defines some of the terms essential to that field. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derek Thompson:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Your research spans memory, aging, Alzheimer’s, dementia. What got you into this space?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sandra Weintraub:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; What got me into this? Well, OK, so if you really want to go way back to my undergraduate years at McGill University, McGill was kind of the first place in North America to really be interested in the brain and behavior. How does your brain do all the things that you do: think and talk and behave and sing and all of that? So I was incredibly interested in that, but there was no real field that was a clinical field for people who were interested in brain and behavior unless you wanted to be a neurosurgeon or a neurologist, which I didn’t want to do that. So over the years, this specialty developed of neuropsychology, and I decided that’s what I wanted to do because neuropsychology is the clinical psychology specialty devoted to working with the results of brain injury. Not kind of therapy or your feelings, but really somebody who has been developing normally has a brain injury: What happens, and why does it happen, and what are the different parts of the brain that cause it to happen? That’s where I really started.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My interest in aging, I then went to work at the Boston Aphasia Research Center and was very interested in people who had had strokes, who lost their language. And I worked there for a very long time. And then when I was ready, finished my degree and ready to get a job, I had my first job at a hospital that had a lot of older patients, and a lot of the older patients that I was seeing—and in those days, of course, people just never got the medical attention until things were really advanced. So I was seeing people who were in pretty late stages of dementia, and as I worked more and more in this field, and as we made more progress, we began to realize that you don’t wake up with dementia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It starts 10, 20 years earlier, and we started seeing people earlier and earlier and earlier. So then I became really interested in: What is the earliest sign of a dementia? We always think of memory loss, but in our case, we’ve discovered that you can have an aphasia as the first sign of a progressive dementia, or you can have visuospatial deficits, or you can have behavioral changes. So I really got interested in: What can these neurodegenerative diseases tell me about the human brain and how it works? Then there was this thing called “normal aging,” and I started seeing people who were worried about their memory, but they didn’t have any problems when they were tested. And so I saw people who seemed to be kind of normal for their age, and then I saw people who were incredible that had memories like a 20-year-old, and I got really interested in: Why do those people, well, how can they preserve their memory?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thompson:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Let me just stop you right there before you finish your story. I would love to make sure that we retrace some of the vocabulary here. Tell me what aphasia is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Weintraub:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Sure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thompson: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;And then also, could you slow down and distinguish between what one might call “normal memory loss” and what is diagnosed as dementia or Alzheimer’s?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Weintraub:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Those are very excellent questions. So the first thing you asked was: What is aphasia? Aphasia is a term—I mean, if you want to break it down from the Latin, it means “without language or without speech”—and it is the term that’s applied to a loss of the ability to communicate using words, understanding words, reading words, anything that has to do with your brain making words. Usually, it’s due to a stroke, but it can also be due to neurodegeneration in the part of the brain that controls your language function.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thompson:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; And when we’re defining dementia and Alzheimer’s, what are we talking about here?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Weintraub: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;How long do you have, because … So normal aging is if you take 1,000 people between 65 and 85, and you give them a test, and you get a total score on the test, and then you average the score on that test: That’s what’s considered average for that age range. However, if you look at who’s at the bottom and who’s at the top, you have a huge spread across that average. I don’t know if you know what the standard deviation is, but it’s kind of variation around a mean. So when you take 30-year-olds and you do that test, their standard deviation is much, much smaller. If you take 80-year-olds, it’s huge. So it means that there are people at the top of that standard deviation that are performing like 30-year-olds, and that’s … So I don’t believe in normal aging. For me, there’s no such thing as normal aging.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, how do you tell if somebody is really having problems? And when you use the word &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;dementia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, we don’t talk about dementia; we talk about cognitive impairment, because there are stages. So you can start off with what’s called mild cognitive impairment, and if this is a neurodegenerative, it keeps going over time, and it eventually turns into a dementia, which means that you have cognitive impairment so severe that you can no longer function in your daily life. A lot of people have mild cognitive impairment, and they’re fine daily. They can drive. They can do finances. They’re just a little annoyed by their memory loss. But when it gets to the point where you’re not remembering things, you miss paying bills, you’re forgetting where you’re going when you’re driving, that’s what we call dementia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., more than 38 million Americans have diabetes (about 1 in 10), of which some 90–95 percent have type 2, in which the body either can't use insulin effectively, or does not produce enough of it to regulate blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecnoglutide—which is not yet licensed—and dulaglutide both help manage blood sugar levels by acting on the same receptor in the body, known as the GLP-1 receptor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecnoglutide targets specific pathways in the body that enhance insulin production and lower blood sugar, while avoiding another pathway that can sometimes reduce the receptor's activity, the researchers explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dulaglutide, on the other hand, turns on both pathways the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ecnoglutide demonstrates a better efficacy of weight loss and blood sugar control compared to existing medications in the trials," study author Feifei Jiang told &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 52-week study of more than 600 adults in China with type 2 diabetes, participants who received ecnoglutide saw their average blood sugar drop by about 1.9 percent, compared to a 1.65 percent drop in participants who received dulaglutide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People taking ecnoglutide also lost nearly twice as much weight as those on dulaglutide, experiencing an average body weight reduction of 5.2–5.7 percent compared to an average weight loss of 2.8 percent for those taking dulaglutide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The additional weight loss seen in participants taking ecnoglutide could further help diabetes management and reduce risks of heart disease, according to the authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Based on currently available information (primarily from clinical trials), the types of side effects associated with ecnoglutide are expected to be similar to those of existing GLP-1 receptor agonists (such as semaglutide or dulaglutide), primarily including gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting) and decreased appetite. Most cases were mild to moderate side effects and tended to decrease gradually with prolonged treatment," Jiang explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecnoglutide is also simpler to produce than other GLP-1 receptor agonists, the study highlights. This means it can be manufactured more quickly and at a lower cost than other weight loss medications currently available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This adds to the growing body of evidence that suggests ecnoglutide could be a valuable new treatment option for people with type 2 diabetes, offering effective blood sugar control and weight loss, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;	&lt;figure class="block block-ibtg-article fA" data-gtm-category="Related In-Text A" data-gtm-action="Click"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of how it comparises to Ozempic, the researchers wrote in the paper: "Ecnoglutide, a novel GLP-1 receptor agonist, is composed entirely of natural amino acids with chemical modifications to enhance stability and activity, differing from semaglutide by four amino acids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They explained these modifications not only improve how the drug works but the manufacturing process in this case too. Unlike semaglutide, which requires extra chemical steps to attach additional amino acids, ecnoglutide can be made more directly through genetically engineered cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although this study presents a valuable comparison of ecnoglutide with dulaglutide, comparisons with semaglutide are also of clinical interest due to the structural similarity between ecnoglutide and semaglutide, and the greater glycemic and weight-lowering effects reported with semaglutide versus dulaglutide," they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, at the time of study conduct, limited availability of semaglutide in China made its inclusion as a comparator unfeasible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the researchers said side-by-side consideration with the Phase &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33074557/" target="_blank" title="3 SUSTAIN-China study" class="multivariate"&gt;3 SUSTAIN-China study&lt;/a&gt; of semaglutide might offer some insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although no direct comparison has been conducted, these findings indirectly suggest that their efficacy might be similar. Future head-to-head trials will be required to confirm this," the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jiang explained that SUSTAIN-China showed average blood sugar was reduced by 1.4 percent to 1.7 percent with semaglutide after 30 weeks, whereas with ecnoglutide it dropped by 1.89 percent to 1.91 percent after 32 weeks (shown in the separate study).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, body weight was reduced by 5.2 percent to 5.7 percent with ecnoglutide after 52 weeks, while it was reduced by 3.9 percent to 5.7 percent with semaglutide after 30 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those results suggest that the efficacy of ecnoglutide might be similar or even better than semaglutide in glycemic control," Jiang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further studies are needed to explore ecnoglutide's efficacy across diverse populations and in combination with other antidiabetic agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While ecnoglutide has not yet received formal marketing authorization for any indication in any country or region worldwide, in China, new drug applications (NDAs) are under review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ecnoglutide is expected to achieve optimal efficacy when combined with behavioral and lifestyle support interventions. Lifestyle guidance like dietary planning and exercise recommendations helps patients establish sustainable healthy habits," said Jiang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a tip on a health story that &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; should be covering?

Morten Harket (right) from the Norwegian group A-ha recently announced his diagnosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For too long, Parkinson's has been fundamentally misunderstood,' they said. 'The majority of the public, and even many scientists, still view the disease as an inevitable consequence of aging. In their eyes, the disease reflects increasing longevity and the unfortunate consequence of genetics. They are mistaken.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctors identify the research that has established the more likely cause of the rise in Parkinson's: the pesticides in our food and farms, the industrial toxins in the water we drink and the hidden particles in the air we breathe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Armed with that knowledge, they say, a few simple lifestyle changes - from using water and air filters to rolling up your car windows in traffic - can reduce exposure and actually prevent the onset of Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They believe their recommendations can even be effective with people who have a family history of the disease, and those who have already started to show symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is never too late to get started,' they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We take a lesson from smoking.

Let's apply what we have learned and begin preventing the disease now.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Below are five of their 25 steps to prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Wash your produce (even if it's organic)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pesticides have made their way into our food supply. In 2024, Consumer Reports found that remnants of pesticides posed a significant health risk in 20 percent of common foods that it examined, including blueberries, bell peppers and potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Purchasing organic produce, dairy products and meat can all help reduce exposure. However, even organic produce can have unsafe pesticide residues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So what can you do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regardless of whether you buy organic or conventional fruits and vegetables, wash them. Use water and possibly a vegetable wash, because, like dirt, many pesticides do not dissolve in water. These washes are available in many grocery stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pesticides have made their way into our food supply - foods at particular risk include blueberries, bell peppers and potatoes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Regardless of whether you buy organic or conventional fruits and vegetables, wash them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vinegar and salt solutions are good options too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To determine what levels of pesticides are safe, the US Department of Agriculture measures them after food has been washed with water for 15 to 20 seconds. If that is their practice, yours should be even longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another way to reduce your overall exposure to pesticides without buying entirely organic produce is to consult the reports of the Environmental Working Group, which lists foods with a lot of exposure (the Dirty Dozen) and those with much less (the Clean Fifteen). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another good way to learn what pesticides are being used is to go to a farmer's market or join a community-supported agricultural farm where you can speak to the farmers who grow the crops&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Don't go to a grocery store near a dry cleaners&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Perchloroethylene (PCE), the dry-cleaning chemical, can readily spread beyond the walls of a dry cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PCE dissolves in fat. In Germany, the chemical has been found in dairy products at supermarkets near dry cleaners - the levels at those shops were two to 20 times the levels found in those farther away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Germany now prohibits supermarkets from being located close to dry cleaners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, next time you go shopping at your local market, look around at the neighboring businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Have a cup of coffee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has repeatedly demonstrated that caffeine consumption is associated with a decreased risk of Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caffeine may protect the dopamine-producing nerve cells from the damage that results from exposure to toxicants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The benefits appear to be present regardless of your beverage of choice (coffee or tea) but are not present with decaffeinated drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of course, caffeine has its own health risks, such as spurring on anxiety and headaches. But thanks to the research, you now have another reason to enjoy your morning cup of joe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Exercise is the best tool we have in the neurodegeneration prevention tool kit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Exercise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his best-selling book, Outlive, Dr Peter Attia wrote: 'I now tell patients that exercise is, full stop and hands down, the best tool we have in the neurodegeneration prevention tool kit.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise may improve the function of the mitochondria, the energy-producing parts of cells, that are damaged by toxicants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physical activity also releases growth factors in the brain that protect nerve cells, including the dopamine-producing ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vigorous exercise can lower the risk of developing Parkinson's, and moving every day is also beneficial for those who already have the disease. A recent study found that six months of aerobic exercise (riding a stationary bike at least three times weekly, for example) reduced brain atrophy and slowed disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ask your favorite course or club what pesticides they use and when they spray&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Golf with caution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While no studies, to our knowledge, have examined rates of Parkinson's among avid golfers, one study in 1996 looked at the death certificates of golf course superintendents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that these workers who commonly use pesticides to keep golf courses weed-free had twice the risk of dying due to a nervous system disorder than the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What are the 25 million golfers in the US and 67 million worldwide to do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ask your favorite course or club what pesticides they use and when they spray, encourage them to use less, and have them consider safer alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the interim, avoid playing on courses just after they have been sprayed, and don't lick your golf ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;The full list of 25 actions is published in The Parkinson's Plan: A New Path to Prevention and Treatment by Ray Dorsey MD and Michael S Okun MD, PublicAffairs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But some new research suggests that you might be able to counteract high blood pressure to some degree with a humble veggie: the beet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the major takeaway from a study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891584925008068" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Free Radical Biology and Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Free Radical Biology and Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (and plenty of other research, TBH). But why beets? And how much of the stuff do you need to consume to really reap the health benefits? Here’s what you need to know, with expert insights from a doctor and two nutritionists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/sonya.angelone/?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sonya Angelone, RDN,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sonya Angelone, RDN,&lt;/a&gt; a nutritionist and registered dietitian based in San Francisco; &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cheng-Han Chen, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen, MD&lt;/a&gt;, an interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA; Christy Brissette, MS, RD, owner of &lt;a href="https://80twentynutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:80 Twenty Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;80 Twenty Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers recruited 39 people under the age of 30 as well as 36 people in their 60s and 70s, and had them go through two different two-week phases. In one phase, they consumed nitrate-rich beetroot juice (a.k.a. beet juice) daily. In the second phase, people consumed a placebo version of the drink with nitrates removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you’re not familiar with nitrates, they're compounds of &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/mn/what-nitrate" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nitrogen and oxygen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;nitrogen and oxygen&lt;/a&gt; that occur naturally in the soil, water, vegetables, and processed meats. Nitrates in vegetables are converted to nitric oxide, which has &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006295222004191" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart-health benefits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart-health benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between the two phases, the participants had a two-week “wash out” period to reset their bodies. The researchers also used bacterial gene sequencing to find microbes that were in the participants’ mouths before and after each treatment phase. They took blood pressure readings, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers ultimately found that participants' oral microbiome changed dramatically after they consumed the nitrate-rich beet juice, but there were differences between the older and younger groups. The older group experienced a noticeable drop in the oral bacteria Prevotella after drinking beet juice, as well as an increase in good oral bacteria, like Neisseria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The older group initially had higher average blood pressure readings at the beginning of the study, but their blood pressure dropped after they had the nitrate-rich beetroot juice. (But not after they had the placebo drink.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do beets help lower blood pressure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first study to link beets to lower blood pressure. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8965354/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:scientific analysis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;scientific analysis&lt;/a&gt; published in 2022 found that people saw an improvement in their blood pressure consuming 70 milliliters, 140 milliliters, and 250 milliliters (about a cup) of beet juice a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939475324002369" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:analysis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; published in 2024 found that there was a “significant effect” on systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) up to 90 days after participants had a daily dose of beet juice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But…why? Well, it's a slightly complicated process. “Beets contain nitrates which are converted to nitrites by good bacteria in the mouth,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/sonya.angelone/?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sonya Angelone, RDN,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sonya Angelone, RDN,&lt;/a&gt; a nutritionist and registered dietitian based in San Francisco. “The nitrites-rich saliva is swallowed, where it is converted to nitric oxide in the stomach.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That nitric oxide is then absorbed into the bloodstream, where it helps blood vessels relax and widen, in a process called vasodilation, says &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cheng-Han Chen, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen, MD&lt;/a&gt;, an interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA. "This process improves blood pressure," he says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria in your mouth matters, too. "Without the right balance of good bacteria in your mouth, the conversion of the nitrates in beets can’t happen, so you won't get the blood pressure-lowering effects from beets or beet root juice," says Christy Brissette, MS, RD, owner of &lt;a href="https://80twentynutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:80 Twenty Nutrition.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;80 Twenty Nutrition.&lt;/a&gt; "Eating a diet that is high in inorganic nitrates from beets and green leafy vegetables also seems to prevent the growth of unhealthy bacteria in the mouth, which could also help to lower blood pressure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What other health benefits do beets have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beets actually have a lot going for them outside of blood pressure. They're also a good source of fiber "which is good for digestion and gut health,” Angelone says. And they contain antioxidants which can help reduce inflammation and lower your risk for chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only that, beets contain folate and potassium, which are good for heart health. “They may also support athletic performance by enhancing the mitochondrial function, the energy producing structure in the cells,” Angelone says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much should I be eating to reap the benefits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get the health benefits from beets, it’s good to eat about a cup of the veggie nearly every day, Angelone says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you have high blood pressure, Brissette says it’s important to talk to your healthcare provider about the lifestyle moves you’re making to try to get that blood pressure back down. Also, keep in mind that beets or beet juice aren’t designed to replace any blood pressure-lowering medication you may be on—but they can support your efforts, per Dr. Chen. "The reductions in blood pressure are modest, but they are measurable," Dr. Chen adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One more thing to point out: Beets aren't the only nitrate-rich veggie out there. So, if this vegetable isn't for you, consider loading up spinach, celery, and kale to reap similar benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBJRzlxVGtxSDNLdW1FMThJcUFCa3VoUG1kRkRzM1AtMXNhalFGSmF6djBIS3hMblpIalk5Q1RNaVdMQk85aFE0bVFqWGN5X1VJaHdjLWNLLWhmQm9qanBybnNmUl9WRlJ5VERTbjhQbmhwOGVD</guid></item><item><title>在大脑中，失去的肢体永远不会真正消失- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/27/nx-s1-5515601/brain-map-lost-limb-amputee-plasticity</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;A rare circulatory problem required Emily Wheldon to have her left arm amputated three years ago. Her brain still thinks it's there.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Most days, it just feels like I've got my arm next to me," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The perception is so compelling that Wheldon had to train herself not to rely on the missing limb.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When I first had the amputation," she says, "I was trying to put my arm out to stop myself from falling."&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Now, a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02037-7" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of Wheldon and two other people with arm amputations may help explain why they are living with phantom limbs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Brain scans showed that in all three, "the phantom hand representation is exactly similar to the pre-amputated hand representation," even five years after surgery, says &lt;a href="https://www.rnel.pitt.edu/people/hunter-schone-phd" target="_blank"&gt;Hunter Schone&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral associate at the University of Pittsburgh who started the project as a doctoral student at University College London.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The finding, which appears in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, challenges decades-old research in &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1843843" target="_blank"&gt;monkeys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/375482a0" target="_blank"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that after losing sensory input from a limb, the brain dramatically reorganizes the areas linked to that limb.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"I'm not sure the [new] study really negates that research," says &lt;a href="https://www.pennstatehealth.org/doctors/krishnankutty-sathian-mbbs-phd" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Krish Sathian&lt;/a&gt;, the chair of neuroscience at Penn State Health, who was not involved in the research. "But the plot thickens, which is always the case in science."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sathian and Schone agree the finding bodes well for people who rely on a surgically implanted brain-computer interface to control a prosthetic or robotic limb. The interface depends on the brain maintaining for many years the circuits once used to move an arm, hand, or leg.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A brain map of the body&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The news study involved three people who knew they were going to have an amputation because of cancer or some other disease.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Researchers performed MRI scans before and after the amputation to look for changes in the &lt;a href="https://www.brainfacts.org/thinking-sensing-and-behaving/touch/2020/the-neuroscience-of-touch-and-pain-013020#:~:text=Sensations%20begin%20as%20signals%20generated,they're%20several%20centimeters%20apart." target="_blank"&gt;somatosensory cortex&lt;/a&gt;, an area of the brain that maintains a detailed map of the body.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When you touch something with your hand, a certain region's activated," Schone says. "If you feel something with your toes, a different region is activated."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Before the amputation, participants in the scanner would move their fingers, allowing scientists to see which brain regions responded. Up to five years after the amputation, participants imagined moving their missing fingers.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Earlier studies had suggested that after the loss of a hand, the brain would shift the borders of its body map. The area responding to the missing hand would shrink, while the neighboring area linked to the lips would expand.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But that's not what the team found.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's no evidence that the map of the lips is changing," Schone says, "which goes completely against all of those old studies that suggest if you lose this body part, this region of the brain is going to completely reorganize."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Earlier studies were limited because they compared the brains of people who'd already lost a limb with the brains of typical people. The new study appears to be the first to look at the same person's brain before and after an amputation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Prosthetic arms and phantom limb pain&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Like many people who've had an amputation, Wheldon often feels pain in her phantom arm and hand.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's like a throbbing pain that becomes quite unbearable at times," she says. Sometimes it feels like her wrist is sore, other times it's like her fingers are cramping.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Previous research suggested phantom limb pain was the result of changes in the brain's body map. But the new study suggests it occurs &lt;em&gt;because &lt;/em&gt;the map hasn't changed, and the brain is still expecting signals from the missing body part.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Imagine if you had a nerve that was receiving a highly detailed information for the body and suddenly now it's receiving some strange, atypical input," Schone says. "How the brain would deal with something like this?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It might interpret the input as pain, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If so, he says, the solution may lie in finding a new home for a nerve ending, rather than just leaving it exposed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;An unchanging body map could be a huge boost for the emerging field of brain-computer interfaces, which can allow a paralyzed person to speak or move a robotic arm.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many of these interfaces place electrodes in the same area of the brain that maintains the body map. So they depend on that map remaining constant over many years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new evidence for this "offers a lot of hope for patients with neurological conditions," Sathian says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Emily Wheldon isn't seeking a brain-computer interface that could control a prosthetic left arm.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But she says it's helpful just to have a scientific explanation of why her missing limb still seems like it's attached, and sometimes hurts.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"A lot of people don't realize that you can actually still feel the limb," she says, "and they're shocked when I say I'm suffering from phantom pain."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Wheldon has been able to control that pain with electrical stimulation and a therapy that uses a visual representation of the missing limb. And she says the phantom pain is much less severe than the pain she felt when her arm was still there.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Back then, the pain was so intense I couldn't look after my newborn daughter," she says. Now she's back at work and able to help her kids get dressed and ready for school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Social distancing is just a vague memory. Interest in vaccines is waning. COVID, for many, feels like an inevitable annoyance, like the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, each summer, we get a rude reminder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The season of travel and fun continues to bring a spike in COVID-19 activity, far less profound than during the height of the pandemic but enough for people to notice and worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This summer’s jump is being fueled by the subvariant XFG, nicknamed “Stratus.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we learn more about COVID, we are seeing that it has two surges a year: the late fall/early winter and in the summer, so we expect this trend of increased cases in the summer to continue,” said Dr. Elizabeth Hudson, the regional chief of infectious disease at Kaiser Permanente Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-summer" class="subhead"&gt;Why summer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of factors that could explain why COVID activity seems to ramp up along with the temperature, according to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Summertime travel and increased social mixing because of social events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Spending time indoors to beat the heat: Respiratory viruses tend to spread more easily in environments with low humidity and cool temperatures. Air-conditioned spaces might not have adequate ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Waning immunity from vaccination and previous infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Mutations: As the virus spreads, it acquires mutations that allow it to evade our existing immunity. Eventually, a version of the virus collects enough mutations that it has a slight edge over other viruses, and if other factors line up, it can sweep through a population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-do-the-numbers-show" class="subhead"&gt;What do the numbers show?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate at which coronavirus tests in California came back positive was 11.59% for the week ending Aug. 16. That’s up from a positive test rate of 5.69% for the week ending July 19, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/RespiratoryVirusReport.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;California Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The positive test rate is expected to further increase in the coming weeks, the department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“COVID-19 test positivity this summer looks similar to [the] summer of 2023 so far,” the department said. That year saw the summer COVID wave &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-10-10/l-a-countys-covid-19-summer-bump-is-declining"&gt;peak in early September&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, which saw &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-08-12/why-is-covid-still-surging-in-california-a-midsummer-mutation-may-be-to-blame"&gt;the largest summer spike since 2022&lt;/a&gt;, COVID activity maxed out in early August. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID is also increasingly a reason why people are seeking urgent medical care. For the week ending Aug. 17, COVID diagnosis was the &lt;a class="link" href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#ed-visits_separated_by_age_group" target="_blank"&gt;reason&lt;/a&gt; why 4.04% of children in California up to age 11 were in the emergency room — up from 1.02% during the last week in June. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID was the reason why 2.25% of people age 75 and older were in the emergency room over the same period, up from 1.13% during the last week of June, state data show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="so-what-the-pandemic-emergency-is-over" class="subhead"&gt;So what? The pandemic emergency is over&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise in COVID comes as the disease has receded as a major worry from the minds of many, with fewer people getting annual COVID vaccines and even fewer wearing masks in any setting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, COVID can result in significant illness — a “razor blade” sore throat and miserable cough for some and hospitalization and even &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7338a1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; for the very young, very old and chronically ill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a class="link" href="https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Preliminary-2024-2025-U-S-COVID-19-Burden-Estimate/ahrf-yqdt/about_data" target="_blank"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that at least 38,000 have &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/surveillance/burden-estimates.html" target="_blank"&gt;died&lt;/a&gt; from COVID-19 for the season that began Oct. 1. During the same period, the CDC estimates the number of &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html" target="_blank"&gt;flu deaths&lt;/a&gt; to be at least 27,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time,&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-02/how-common-is-long-covid-a-new-study-provides-fresh-clues"&gt; long COVID &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-02-14/risk-for-chronic-fatigue-soars-among-covid-19-patients-study-says"&gt;other related impacts&lt;/a&gt; of the coronavirus remain major issues for &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/long-covid/php/scientific-approach/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;millions.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-vaccine-numbers-like" class="subhead"&gt;What are the vaccine numbers like?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just 14.7% of California’s population has received the updated COVID-19 vaccine that first became &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2024-08-22/fda-approves-updated-covid-19-vaccines-shots-should-be-available-in-days"&gt;available nearly a year ago&lt;/a&gt;. Uptake was greatest among the oldest Californians, with 37.2% of state seniors age 65 and up getting the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those ages 50 to 64, 17.7% have gotten their shot, as have 9.5% of younger adults ages 18 to 49. Among children ages 5 to 11, 5.9% have been vaccinated, and for those younger than 5, 3.2% have been vaccinated with the latest COVID-19 vaccine formula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health continues to recommend that everyone age 6 months and older stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is particularly important for higher-risk individuals, such as infants and toddlers, pregnant individuals, older persons, and others with risks for serious disease,” the department said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department’s advice resembles the CDC’s past guidance, which has changed since the start of the second Trump administration and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-02-13/robert-f-kennedy-jr-confirmed-health-human-services"&gt;the appointment of&lt;/a&gt; vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to head the CDC’s parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC now says it offers “no guidance” as to whether healthy pregnant women should get the COVID vaccine, and asks parents of healthy children to talk with a healthcare provider before getting the COVID vaccine for their youngsters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mainstream medical organizations, like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, continue to recommend that people receive the updated COVID-19 vaccine at any point during pregnancy. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends infants and children ages 6 months to 23 months get the updated COVID vaccine, since they are at high risk of severe illness should they get COVID, and that the vaccine should be offered for children age 2 and older if their parent wishes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some doctors, including Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco infectious diseases expert, have suggested that people who haven’t been vaccinated in more than a year, and are at risk for severe complications should they get COVID, get vaccinated with the currently available shots now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong noted that the 2025-26 version of the COVID vaccine should be “relatively the same formula” as the 2024-25 version. “It’s less important to wait,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eligibility for the new vaccine has been delayed by the Trump administration, and it isn’t clear when it’ll become available or who will be eligible outside of older people and those with chronic health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some pharmacy chains and health providers have paused online scheduling of appointments for COVID-19 vaccines until the 2025-26 version is released, presumably later this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at least one chain, CVS, says all of its pharmacies nationwide offer the 2024-25 version of the COVID-19 vaccine and that it is available on a walk-in basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All CVS Pharmacy locations across the U.S. currently offer the COVID-19 vaccine. We’ll continue to offer to eligible patients, as determined by the [Food and Drug Administration] and CDC, until an updated 2025-2026 vaccine is released,” CVS spokesperson Amy Thibault said in a statement to The Times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Digital vaccination scheduling is paused temporarily, but we are still offering walk-in COVID-19 vaccinations,” Thibault said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-might-the-rest-of-the-summer-look-like" class="subhead"&gt;What might the rest of the summer look like?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials note that the spread of COVID appears to be less severe this summer compared to last. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across California, levels of the coronavirus detected in wastewater are about 20% lower than the peak of the 2023 summer wave, and about 50% below the height of the 2024 summer wave, the state Department of Public Health said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this time of year, COVID hospitalizations are currently considered low, based off thresholds “established from the data from the past five seasons,” the department said. “Deaths are also lower than previous seasons.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-can-i-do-to-protect-myself" class="subhead"&gt;What can I do to protect myself?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some steps those concerned about COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases can take: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Get vaccinated now, especially if you’re at higher risk of severe complications from COVID-19 and haven’t received a vaccine in more than a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• If you do get sick with COVID-19, talk with a medical provider about getting &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-01-28/paxlovid-anitivirals-for-many-should-be-easier-to-get-heres-what-to-know"&gt;an anti-COVID drug like Paxlovid&lt;/a&gt;, which can reduce the duration of illness and alleviate symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Stay away from sick people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Wear a well-fitting mask, like a KF94 or an N95, in indoor public settings — or perhaps at least carry one with you if you’re traveling, so you can wear it if someone is coughing on a plane. “Now’s a good time to mask in indoor public places if you’re in a high-risk group,” wrote Dr. Matt Willis, former public health officer for Marin County, on the “Your Local Epidemiologist in California” &lt;a class="link" href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-171508787" target="_blank"&gt;blog.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Optimize indoor air quality — opening a window helps!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Test if you’re ill with COVID-like symptoms or have been exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here’s some advice about flu and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Health officials recommend everyone age 6 months and older get the flu shot for the upcoming season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• The vaccine for RSV is &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; for all adults age 75 and older and those ages 50 to 74 who are at increased risk for RSV. People who have already received the RSV vaccine in recent years don’t need another dose at this time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/hcp/vaccine-clinical-guidance/pregnant-people.html" target="_blank"&gt;Pregnant&lt;/a&gt; women should also get a single dose of an RSV vaccine during weeks 32 through 36 of their pregnancy, sometime between September through January.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPekQzRDhsTHJrdTJqOTY2UzlRRHlvaV9aMm5HbzI5TWU1TThtZVVTZTZXTWRkODBFWl93LUs5aWZQYjNsN3FJV3NIS1VvZkhTWEZ1cjB0VjNpdl9rczRsNGxMMGNLN1ptOE5pOTNGZkw5Vy1CUVA1Ml8xRWxPQ2Y0WTRWd243V3RGdjJoU0FwSzlNMFc3MzlqNFJMNVZMbDVmYkhMaG5ZOA</guid></item><item><title>诊断困境：罕见病使女性将人视为龙- Live Science</title><link>https://www.livescience.com/health/diagnostic-dilemma-rare-condition-made-a-woman-see-people-as-dragons</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;

She also saw dragon-like faces appear in front of her spontaneously, even when no people were present. These hallucinations were disturbing and affected her ability to interact with people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="8c30c2e3-d5d1-4519-94ab-9326eaa00f07-2"&gt;The patient reported that human faces that seemed normal at first "turned black, grew long, pointy ears and a protruding snout, and displayed a reptiloid skin and huge eyes in bright yellow, green, blue, or red," doctors wrote &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2814%2961690-1/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2814%2961690-1/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in a report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of her case.

All of the results were normal. However, an MRI of the patient's brain showed several lesions near the lentiform nucleus. Damage to this part of the brain has been &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8566813/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8566813/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;linked to cognitive impairments&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, such as issues with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-psychiatric-treatment/article/cognitive-impairment-in-schizophrenia/E8374E67E84DFD78738923A31CF75A5E" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-psychiatric-treatment/article/cognitive-impairment-in-schizophrenia/E8374E67E84DFD78738923A31CF75A5E" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;attention and memory&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, particularly associated with schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These lesions — which appeared in the insulated wiring of the brain, called white matter — may have been caused by ruptures in small blood vessels in the brain. But the damage was not recent, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the EEG did not reveal any abnormalities, the doctors suspected that the patient's visual hallucinations were caused by atypical electrical activity in parts of the brain that process colors and faces — specifically, the ventral occipitotemporal cortex. This region, located in the back of the brain, is involved in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8260247/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8260247/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;regulating object recognition&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The lesions revealed by the MRI may have triggered this electrical activity, the doctors theorized, and they &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/cms/10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61690-1/attachment/5ba04f26-5634-4a1a-9837-a3b727d717d4/mmc1.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/cms/10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61690-1/attachment/5ba04f26-5634-4a1a-9837-a3b727d717d4/mmc1.pdf" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;may have been present since birth&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps caused by temporary oxygen deprivation shortly before or after delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;The physicians determined that the woman had a form of &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://prosopometamorphopsia.faceblind.org/" data-url="https://prosopometamorphopsia.faceblind.org/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;prosopometamorphopsia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (PMO). This uncommon condition affects how a person perceives human faces, making facial features appear dramatically distorted. Features may seem enlarged or shrunken; they may sag, stretch sideways or drift out of position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zS5JKXrWByWWY4Lk7S3WzD" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zS5JKXrWByWWY4Lk7S3WzD slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://prosopometamorphopsia.faceblind.org/hemipmo/" target="_blank" data-url="https://prosopometamorphopsia.faceblind.org/hemipmo/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hemi-prosopometamorphopsia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or hemi-PMO, just one side of the observed face is affected. In full-face prosopometamorphopsia, or full-face PMO, distortion warps the entire face a person sees. The condition is associated with changes to brain structure and with disorders that affect brain function, such as epilepsy, migraine and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b21a1a75-03de-4c56-a3e0-6fcd7944b226"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;The doctors prescribed the patient daily doses of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682412.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682412.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;valproic acid&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an anticonvulsant that prevents seizures and also alleviates migraines and symptoms of bipolar disorder. The treatment brought the woman's visual hallucinations under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, she then began experiencing hallucinations of banging sounds in her sleep. The doctors switched her to a daily regimen of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/20352-rivastigmine-capsules" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/20352-rivastigmine-capsules" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;rivastigmine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a drug that is commonly used to treat symptoms of dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease. The drug made these auditory hallucinations less frequent and reduced her visual symptoms to a manageable level. After three years of this treatment, the woman reported that her work situation had stabilized and her social relationships had improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;Prosopometamorphopsia is exceptionally rare, with only 81 cases described in the medical literature over the past 100 years, according to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33865569/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33865569/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a 2021 review&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people who experience this condition, its distorting effect on human faces lasts just a few days or weeks. PMO-triggered distortions have been known to make &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)00136-3/abstract" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)00136-3/abstract" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;people's faces appear "demonic"&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — but in the woman's case, it's unclear exactly what caused her highly specific perception of reptilian dragons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-zS5JKXrWByWWY4Lk7S3WzD-UwqIvBA8Pk9mB7Cb6sbVwqwdSRrQFeBi" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-zS5JKXrWByWWY4Lk7S3WzD-UwqIvBA8Pk9mB7Cb6sbVwqwdSRrQFeBi slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;For the past few years, a small team of health scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had been tasked with answering basic statistical questions like: Who is drowning? Where is it happening — in lakes, rivers, swimming pools? And what works to prevent it?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team was starting to answer some of those questions when it was put on administrative leave in April, according to two former CDC officials familiar with the program. They requested that NPR not use their names because they fear retaliation from the Trump administration for speaking to the media.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Now, those results may not come to light, since the Trump administration terminated the CDC's drowning prevention experts this month and has proposed eliminating the program in its &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/information-resources/budget/the-presidents-fy-2026-discretionary-budget-request/" target="_blank"&gt;fiscal year 2026 budget request&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If this program saved one life, it would be far more than the total cost of the program," says Jim Mercy, former director of the Division of Violence Prevention at the CDC, who retired in 2023. "The irony is that these and other programs [at the CDC] were cut under the motivation of creating greater &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-workforce-optimization-initiative/" target="_blank"&gt;efficiency&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Drowning kills &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drowning/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;more than 4,000 people&lt;/a&gt; each year in the United States. It's the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drowning/data-research/facts/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;leading cause of death&lt;/a&gt; among children ages 1 to 4 and is one of the top causes of death among children ages 5 to 14. A single drowning costs &lt;a href="https://wisqars.cdc.gov/cost/" target="_blank"&gt;millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; in terms of medical costs and societal loss, Mercy says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC's drowning prevention program was created in response to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7320e1.htm?s_cid=mm7320e1_w" target="_blank"&gt;spike in drowning deaths&lt;/a&gt; during the COVID-19 pandemic. "After the pandemic, quite a few organizations came together to drive some possibilities of federally focused work on drowning prevention," says &lt;a href="https://ndpa.org/lindsay-a-mondick/" target="_blank"&gt;Lindsay Mondick&lt;/a&gt;, director of aquatic strategy and quality practices for the &lt;a href="https://www.ymca.org/" target="_blank"&gt;YMCA of the USA&lt;/a&gt;, and a longtime water safety advocate. "CDC was a natural fit — not only do they do data science, but they also look at intervention strategies and programs."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Drowning is largely preventable and costs the U.S. economy over &lt;a href="https://ndpa.org/drowning-facts-and-data/" target="_blank"&gt;$50 billion a year&lt;/a&gt;. The CDC's efforts had been focused in two areas: determining the risk factors around drowning and what works to prevent drownings, to reduce the likelihood that children die from drowning.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The drowning prevention team worked with partners like the YMCA, the Red Cross and the National Center for Fatality Review and Prevention to help collect and evaluate data, as well as teach children to swim.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Work with YMCA&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The YMCA has a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drowning/partners/ymca.html" target="_blank"&gt;water safety approach&lt;/a&gt; it has been using for around a decade. "It's focused on developing skills for swimming and water competency — skills that keep people safe if they were to have accidents or find themselves in an unpredictable situation," Mondick says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, the CDC helped it collect data to figure out what was working. "One of the things we were most excited about with this funding is the YMCA was able to build, I think, what is probably the largest drowning data collection hub," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As part of the process, the CDC provided funding for free swim lessons for thousands of kids at high risk of drowning. This included children from &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/drowning/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;some minority groups&lt;/a&gt; and those on the autism spectrum, who are 160 times more likely than their peers to die from drowning, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/news/individuals-autism-substantially-heightened-risk-injury-death" target="_blank"&gt;study from Columbia University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"For a kid with special sensory needs, not only are their senses being challenged because of just water, but it's noisy and it's hot and it's all the things," says &lt;a href="https://ymcadallas.org/leadership" target="_blank"&gt;Jennifer Pewitt&lt;/a&gt;, who oversees swim programs for the YMCA in the Dallas metro area.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At one facility, swim instructors received specialized training on connecting with kids on the autism spectrum. When parents heard they were running this program, they came from all over Dallas County. "There is a huge community need," Pewitt says. "There have been some really awesome stories that have come out of it. And there's been some misses."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;That's the learning process, Pewitt says. The whole time, they collected data with guidance from the CDC. "The Y doesn't employ epidemiologists — that is not a thing," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The goal was to figure out how to best teach kids at high risk of drowning to swim and reduce their risks around water, and to share those lessons widely. "That's where the magic happens — if what worked with these kids can be replicated," Pewitt says. "That was the whole point of it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Potential impact&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC program employed three health scientists and had a $2 million annual budget, most of which was disbursed to partner organizations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's a very small program, but very important," Mercy, formerly with the CDC, says, adding that the program had strong bipartisan support when it started receiving congressional funding a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Especially in small towns, cutting off the CDC funding would be a big loss, says Pewitt. "It's really sad that there isn't going to be those opportunities for those small Y's to serve the kids in their communities."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s not true,” said Robin Murray, a professor of psychiatric research at King’s College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“What we can show in this study is that the effect of cannabis is a bit like the effect of alcohol or the effect of food, that it’s a dimension. So the more you take, the more problems you get into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Contrary to what it says on the internet, cannabis is not medicinal. We now have 40 private clinics up and down the UK dishing out cannabis supposedly as a treatment, and the things that they are giving it for are pain, anxiety and depression predominantly. And these are the things that we find are related to people getting into trouble and becoming more paranoid.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Emily Finch, the chair of the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ addiction faculty, said: “These important findings reinforce previous work which suggests that cannabis can have significant adverse effects on users’ mental health. Society must be more aware of the substantial evidence on cannabis harms, and correct the widespread misapprehension that cannabis is not an addictive substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Cannabis is the most widely used illicit substance in the UK, and around a third of people who use cannabis develop a problem with the drug at some point during their lives. This is similar to the proportion of people who will develop a problem with alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The use of both natural and ‘synthetic’ cannabinoids over the long term risks addiction and severe co-occurring mental illness harms. Daily cannabis use is associated with depression, anxiety and reduced motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Daily users of high-potency cannabis are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than people who have never used cannabis, with adolescents at particular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“As a priority, the UK government must provide substance use and mental health services with the training, staff and funding they need to support people with co-occurring substance use and mental illness. This must also include a focus on providing early treatment to the increasing number of children and young people struggling with substance misuse if we are to reduce long-term harms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A separate study published in the journal Psychological Medicine analysed the same survey, and found 52% of cannabis users had experienced some kind of childhood trauma, and that those who had experienced physical and emotional abuse had paranoia scores around 35-40% higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Respondents who reported experiencing sexual abuse as a child consumed more THC on average, followed by those who had experienced physical and emotional abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 08:54:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixAFBVV95cUxQWEtNdzBROGhGaXBpUXBaTy1VOUxBNEp1Z0ZveUYxZFJFU3NZX19UWVZSNlQ0MmdGenN2LUVmNXNTWXBaMlE4dVVFdkJSMkZoTFYzTlptTmNHWEVKaHNIYVlGdDlPcG82YU41bFFpWTd4NmFfTi1BMkd2aU9EbFFCZTJpbVFGSEdudVFLOWliRFhXODhCb2lXdGFfaXZsM3ljdmZreXVJQzJ0TF9iWTFhQW9zMktoWDI2eUxyQzJpR0ViS3d3</guid></item><item><title>食肉细菌病例正在上升。科学家表示，气候变化是罪魁祸首-美国有线电视新闻网</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/27/us/flesh-eating-bacteria-climate-change</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Just southwest of New Orleans, in a tranquil fishing village on the Louisiana bayou, Linard Lyons spent the morning on his 19-foot boat, preparing crab traps for his grandchildren just like he had done thousands of times before.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeszzo2p000i3b6nhlhy3sd8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This time, he noticed a tiny scratch on his leg – a scratch that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/18/health/dual-hurricanes-milton-and-helene-cause-flesh-eating-bacteria-cases-to-rise-in-florida" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;nearly cost him his life&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjiz00033j6o9dhb0hk1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lyons went about his day but woke up the following morning feeling “delusional.” Feverish and vomiting, he initially thought he had just contracted a stomach bug, but then discovered a series of blackening sores spreading across his left leg.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj000043j6of5cvjgau@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In what turned out to be a life-saving move, he went straight to his family doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj000053j6o34kkfv41@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lyons tells CNN his doctor immediately knew “exactly what it was” and sent him straight to the emergency room. In the “matter of maybe an hour,” Lyons found himself in the hospital’s operating room.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj000063j6o1487gcrl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That small scratch on Lyons’ leg became the entryway for &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/20/health/what-is-vibrio-explainer"&gt;Vibrio vulnificus&lt;/a&gt;, also known as flesh-eating bacteria. Those black sores on his leg signified &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/09/health/sargassum-seaweed-blob-flesh-eating-bacteria-scn-wellness/index.html"&gt;necrotizing fasciitis&lt;/a&gt;, which “affects the tissue under your skin,” according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23103-necrotizing-fasciitis" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj000073j6ovya4755u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These potentially deadly bacteria are naturally found and thrive in coastal waters during the warmer months, especially in brackish waters, where fresh water meets the sea, according to the US &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html#:~:text=Vibrio%20are%20bacteria%20that%20naturally%20live%20in%20certain%20coastal%20waters.%20They%20are%20found%20in%20higher%20numbers%20in%20May%20through%20October%2C%20when%20water%20temperatures%20are%20warmer" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease and Control Prevention.&lt;/a&gt; Once largely confined to the Gulf Coast, cases have surged along the East Coast, with an 800% increase from 1988 to 2018, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2023/han00497.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj000093j6ozwekyk7b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Do I have permission to do what I need to do to save your life?” Lyons’ doctor asked.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000a3j6oj1547k3b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These were the last words Lyons recalled hearing before surgery. He immediately understood the seriousness of the situation and realized his leg may have to be amputated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000b3j6oi2ix73h4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was given a 50/50 chance of coming out of the hospital alive at that point,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000c3j6og3v0icqr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;surgeons were able to both cut away the infection and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;save Lyons’&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;leg. After three days in the intensive care unit, three weeks in the hospital and various antibiotics, he was “cleared of the bacteria.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000d3j6o37igh08h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It has been more than three months since he contracted the flesh-eating bacteria, yet his recovery is far from over.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000e3j6obudqm05k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recovery has not been comfortable for Lyons, who has diabetes; he describes it as a “misery.” Yet, he remains hopeful that a skin graft will be the final step in getting his leg back to “normal.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000f3j6o5tne85no@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vibrio vulnificus should generally not pose a fatal risk to the average person, Mississippi’s State Health Officer Dr. Daniel Edney tells CNN. People with a weakened immune system have a higher risk of contracting an infection, Edney said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000g3j6o0aaodvjq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you plan to be in coastal water, assume it&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is contaminated with Vibrio and avoid the water if you have “cuts or wounds that could be potentially infected,” according to Edney.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000h3j6o5ve0cf9n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, Vibrio infection doesn’t occur only through wound-to-water contact. It can also stem from consuming certain foods.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;em&gt;“CONSUMING RAW OR UNDERCOOKED MEATS, POULTRY, SEAFOOD, SHELLFISH OR EGGS MAY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF FOODBORNE ILLNESS, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE CERTAIN MEDICAL CONDITIONS.”&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            This warning, often found in small print at the bottom of restaurant&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;menus, may look familiar. In Louisiana, this specific warning must be “clearly visible” at all establishments that sell or serve raw oysters – with few exceptions – according to the &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/page/654" target="_blank"&gt;Louisiana Department of Health.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Vibriosis can also be contracted by eating raw or undercooked shellfish. Most often it’s a less serious infection from a different type of the bacteria, causing only stomach discomfort, but can occasionally find its way into the bloodstream, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2023/han00497.html#:~:text=Vibrio%20are%20bacteria%20that%20cause,About%20150%E2%80%93200%20V." target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Oysters get their food by filtering out sea water. When that water is ripe with bacteria, a single oyster could contain as many as a million Vibrio vulnificus cells, according to &lt;a href="https://pages.charlotte.edu/jim-oliver/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jim Oliver&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000o3j6oq539u1zd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Though it’s rare, “many people with Vibrio vulnificus infection can get seriously ill and need intensive care or limb amputation. About 1 in 5 people with this infection die, sometimes within a day or two of becoming ill,” according to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000p3j6old747hzd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Louisiana was one of the first states to bring attention to this infection this season after it saw a spike in cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000q3j6ow033e5nd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By the end of July, &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/news/vibrio-vulnificus-2025" target="_blank"&gt;officials reported&lt;/a&gt; 17 hospitalizations and four deaths among Louisiana residents, more than double what they typically see. At least three more cases were reported in August.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000r3j6o65p7tzi4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This potentially deadly virus is not just unique to the Gulf states and is being found farther north as water temperatures rise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000t3j6oz4ttrr8a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/department-of-public-health-alerts-public-to-rare-vibrio-vulnificus-bacteria-in-coastal-waters" target="_blank"&gt;Massachusetts Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt; identified an “extremely rare” case of Vibrio vulnificus from a resident exposed to coastal water near Martha’s Vineyard. So far this year, Massachusetts has confirmed 71 cases, with a 30% hospitalization rate and no deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000u3j6ocrhay1vd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Massachusetts, however, is not the only East Coast state reporting increased cases. Virginia Department of Health officials say cases of vibriosis across its residents have been “increasing over the last ten years.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000v3j6o87vykfw7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cases in North Carolina have increased 620% over the past 10 years, and New York’s have more than tripled.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000w3j6oy4hovzsk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists link this trend to climate change.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmesvb4lu00003b6n2wapy2ft@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The oceans are getting warmer and sea level is rising because of human-caused climate change, and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580166/pdf/Bookshelf_NBK580166.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;scientists warn&lt;/a&gt; these factors are increasing the risk of Vibrio infections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000z3j6o5isz7nq9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Oliver, the UNC Charlotte professor, added that melting glaciers are lowering ocean salinity – another factor that increases the threat. “Open sea salt water has too high of a salinity rate for Vibrio vulnificus,” he explained. But when fresh water dilutes it, the “conditions become more favorable.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj000103j6o90ntf17f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As the climate warms, more bacteria stays alive through the winter, which worsens outbreaks in the summer because we’re starting from an already elevated level.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeswo6wb00043b6npv5rbebq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Rachel Noble, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who has studied Vibrio since the early 2000s,&lt;strong&gt;﻿&lt;/strong&gt; told CNN the increased prevalence of this potentially deadly bacterium is being “repeated globally,” indicating a “complexity of issues related to climate change.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj000123j6oam4l7997@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This isn’t going to be the only pathogen that increases in the face of climate change,” Noble said. “It’s just one example, but one we can really learn from.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj000143j6ovvsnvnvz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lyons is encouraging others to learn about Vibrio and hopes local leaders will spread awareness by posting additional signage to warn both residents and visitors. Any wounds, even a tiny scratch, should be thoroughly washed with soap and clean running water, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/prevention/index.html#:~:text=Immediately%20wash%20wounds%20and%20cuts%20thoroughly%20with%20soap%20and%20clean%20running%20water%20after%20contact%20with%20coastal%20waters%20or%20raw%20seafood%2C%20its%20drippings%2C%20or%20its%20juices." target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj000153j6optzbugap@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I hope my story helps people understand what to look out for,” Lyons said. It might even “save a life.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj000163j6o35xxojr7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you develop symptoms, “seek help immediately and get to the emergency room,” Lyons urges. “That’s the best thing. Just go there and hopefully you’ll see someone who will recognize it for what it is, because a misdiagnosis can be a death sentence. It really can be.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

While diet is important, research shows that light activity after eating can significantly reduce these spikes by helping muscles absorb glucose from the bloodstream. French biochemist Jessie Inchauspé, widely known as the Glucose Goddess, recently shared on Instagram a simple, science-backed exercise that requires no gym or equipment. This easy routine can help stabilise blood sugar, boost energy, and support overall metabolic health, making it a practical habit for anyone looking to manage post-meal glucose naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why calf raises after meals work for &lt;keyword id="20068265" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="blood-sugar-control" source="keywords"&gt;blood sugar control&lt;/keyword&gt; and how to do it right&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The soleus muscle acts like a “glucose sponge” because it draws sugar from the blood for energy, even without high-intensity effort. Activating this muscle after a meal helps reduce postprandial glucose levels, preventing sharp spikes that lead to energy crashes and metabolic stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;No Gym Needed: Try This Effective Home Workout To Get Fit Quickly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her Instagram reel, Jessie suggests doing calf raises for 5–10 minutes immediately after meals. This simple move activates the soleus muscle in your lower legs, a muscle that is especially efficient at using glucose for energy, even at low-intensity levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Here’s how to do it:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Stand or sit with your feet flat on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Slowly lift your heels off the ground, rising onto your toes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Lower your heels back down and repeat at a steady pace for 5–10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beauty of calf raises is that they’re low impact, convenient, and can be done anywhere, while brushing your teeth, cooking, or even sitting at your desk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;keyword id="26260500" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="health-benefits-of-calf-raises" source="keywords"&gt;Health benefits of calf raises&lt;/keyword&gt; after meals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;1.

Combined with improved circulation from light movement, it supports overall heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;4.

Why do blood sugar spikes happen after meals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood sugar spikes occur when carbohydrates from food break down into glucose and enter the bloodstream faster than the body can process them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q. How does exercise help lower blood sugar after eating?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity stimulates muscles to take up glucose from the blood, reducing post-meal spikes and improving insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q. Why calf raises instead of other exercises?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calf raises target the soleus muscle, which is highly efficient at using glucose for energy, even at low intensity and without heavy exertion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q.

	        &lt;p&gt;A colony of bats near Libby Dam tested positive for the fungus that causes white-nose syndrome, marking the first detection of the deadly disease in western Montana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since it was first observed in New York in 2006, white-nose syndrome has killed millions of bats across the U.S. and Canada.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is caused by a cold-loving fungus, which colonizes the skin of bats. As the fungus grows, it eats lesions into the bat’s wings and begins to disrupt physiological systems, including the bat’s hibernation cycles. Infected bats wake up frequently during the winter. The increased activity eventually leads to starvation as the bat depletes its fat reserves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is probably one of, if not the most, detrimental wildlife disease we’ve seen in North America,” said Shannon Hilty, the state bat biologist for Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is not only deadly, often killing 90-100% of bats in infected colonies, but also highly infectious, with detections now recorded in 45 U.S. states and 10 Canadian provinces. Biologists unearthed the first signs of the fungus in eastern Montana in 2020, but Hilty said she hadn’t expected the disease to crop up as far west as Lincoln County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I thought we had more time before it jumped the Continental Divide,” she said. “I think we all did.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every spring, state biologists swab bats at more than 30 roosting sites across the state, as part of ongoing efforts to monitor the spread of white-nose syndrome. This year was the first time a sample from western Montana returned a positive result. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The positive samples were collected from a group of about 1,500 Yuma myotis and little brown bats roosting in bat boxes near Libby Dam. While the fungus was detected, Hilty said none of the bats showed symptoms of white-nose syndrome when researchers collected the samples in May. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s pretty typical,” she said. “There’s usually a lag between the detection of the fungus and detection of disease.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both species hibernate, making them susceptible to white-nose syndrome. A study published in Conservation Biology found that the number of little brown bats, in particular, had declined by 90% between 1995 and 2018 in areas where white-nose syndrome was present. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That sort of drop could have cataclysmic effects for communities in northwestern Montana. The 15 bat species native to Montana are all insectivores and provide the state with the equivalent of $680 million a year in agricultural pest control, according to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Hilty said there are reasons to be optimistic about the fate of the Libby colony. In many areas, bats hibernate in large colonies, which can facilitate the spread of fungi and other pathogens. Scientists believe bats in western Montana are more likely to tuck themselves into rocky crevasses or beneath the eaves of a house to hibernate alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technological advancements are also providing wildlife managers with more options to contain the disease, including a promising new vaccine that is currently being tested in Glacier National Park. Last summer, a team of researchers administered the oral vaccine to 75 little brown bats captured near St. Mary. Another 75 bats received a placebo vaccine. The team will use tracking devices to monitor the bats over several years and track their long-term survival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iSHuIwcMmtY?si=ftvc5G1iH-wyfqrJ" title="YouTube video player"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe the vaccine is most effective when it is received before bats are exposed to white-nose syndrome, but trials in areas already infected by the fungus have also proven promising. In 2021, scientists immunized a colony of bats in Minnetonka Cave in Idaho after detecting the fungus. As of 2024, symptoms of white-nose syndrome had yet to emerge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hilty is hopeful a similar vaccination effort could help stall the spread of disease in the Libby colony.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re preparing for the worst and hoping for the best,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state is still awaiting results from samples taken this spring from two caves in western Montana. Sites in Glacier National Park and Eureka tested negative for the fungus. Guano samples from the North Shore Wildlife Management Area were inconclusive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang="EN-US"&gt;A site in Bonner County, Idaho also tested positive for white-nose syndrome this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of ongoing monitoring efforts, state wildlife officials are encouraging residents to contact their local field office if they find a dead bat between the months of December and May. Bat mortalities in the winter are a strong indicator of white-nose syndrome. Officials noted that residents need not report bat mortalities during other times of the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While white-nose syndrome only affects bats, other diseases, including rabies, can be transmitted from bats to people. Use protective gear, including gloves, when handling a bat carcass. Secure the carcass in a Ziploc bag or another disposable airtight container for transport to the nearest wildlife office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State biologists are also seeking landowners to assist with bat monitoring efforts on their property. If interested, contact state bat biologist Shannon Hilty at shannon.hilty@mt.gov. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reporter Hailey Smalley can be reached at 758-4433 or &lt;a href="mailto:hsmalley@dailyinterlake.com"&gt;hsmalley@dailyinterlake.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A protein-based biosensor measures cortisol with high &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;accuracy&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;A measure of how close a result or measurement is to the true value.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;accuracy&lt;/span&gt;. Smartphone compatibility makes stress testing more accessible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortisol plays a key role in regulating essential body functions such as blood pressure and metabolism, and disruptions in this stress hormone can contribute to a variety of health problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, measuring cortisol required visits to a doctor’s office or other clinical facilities. A recent breakthrough in artificial biosensor technology now offers the possibility of point-of-care testing, providing more accurate results than existing methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Smartphone-enabled testing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy Yeh, an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at the &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/uc-santa-cruz/"&gt;University of California, Santa Cruz&lt;/a&gt;, has developed a luminescent artificial sensor that attaches to cortisol molecules in blood or urine. Once bound, the sensor produces light, which reveals the concentration of the hormone. A study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/em&gt; confirmed that this method can reliably detect cortisol across the full range of levels important for human health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeh showed that the sensor could be paired with a smartphone camera, allowing cortisol levels to be measured either at home or in a clinic. This approach combines high sensitivity with affordability, eliminating the need for expensive laboratory equipment and making precise hormone monitoring far more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Designed from scratch&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeh specializes in artificial protein engineering, which relies on AI-based computational design to create entirely new proteins rather than modifying ones already found in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this project, he built a protein-based biosensor where cortisol binding causes two engineered proteins to draw close together at the molecular level. This interaction produces a light signal, with brighter emissions corresponding to higher cortisol levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_490855" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-490855" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Andy-Yeh-in-the-Lab.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-490855" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Andy-Yeh-in-the-Lab-777x491.jpg" alt="Andy Yeh in the Lab" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Andy-Yeh-in-the-Lab-777x491.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Andy-Yeh-in-the-Lab-400x253.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Andy-Yeh-in-the-Lab-768x485.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Andy-Yeh-in-the-Lab-1536x970.jpg 1536w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Andy-Yeh-in-the-Lab-2048x1294.jpg 2048w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Andy-Yeh-in-the-Lab-150x95.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Andy-Yeh-in-the-Lab-450x284.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Andy-Yeh-in-the-Lab-1200x758.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-490855" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;UC Santa Cruz Assistant Professor of Biomolecular Engineering Andy Yeh’s lab focuses on artificial protein design. Credit: Impact Creative for UC Santa Cruz&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Yeh’s knowledge, this is the first example of a completely computationally designed biosensor that can perform with such high sensitivity and dynamic range for detecting a small molecule analyte. Using a camera to measure the amount and color of light emitted allows cortisol levels to be read with more sensitivity than current tests provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Point-of-care applications&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new diagnostic tool would be in a “mix and read” format—similar to the technique used in Covid-19 nasal swab rapid tests. The test requires just a drop of blood or urine, which is mixed with a solution that contains the biosensor. Then, a smartphone camera and app could translate the light emitted into a direct measurement of cortisol levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can read the signal directly — the output of the sensor is light emissions, so essentially you can just take a picture of the test with your smartphone,” Yeh said. “Ideally, that’s really field compatible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Dynamic results&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test’s high level of sensitivity is a vast improvement over traditional tests, which don’t usually offer enough quantitative results when outside of the cortisol normal range. Yeh’s solution covers a wider dynamic range, offering quantitative results for healthy, too-low, and elevated levels of cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This sensor is very, very sensitive compared to the current standard methods used in the hospital,” Yeh said. “The dynamic range is huge compared to the traditional assay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down the line, Yeh envisions that this technology may also be used in a drug-development or diagnostic setting to better understand and treat the health issues that arise from cortisol deficiencies or surpluses.&lt;/p&gt;

Here's what the findings really mean, why experts urge caution in interpreting the results, and what runners should watch for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first glance, it seems counterintuitive. &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/five-ways-to-cut-your-risk-of-cancer-by-an-oncology-consultant-245858"&gt;Decades of evidence&lt;/a&gt; show regular exercise &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6527123/"&gt;lowers cancer risks&lt;/a&gt;, including bowel cancer, and improves outcomes &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/59/14/1010"&gt;after a cancer diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172180" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172180" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer2_642.jpg" alt="woman running" class="wp-image-172180 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer2_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer2_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer2_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172180" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Exercise reduces risks of many cancers. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MABqghXaI2U/"&gt;Jacob Lund/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study doesn't overturn that science. Instead, it suggests a narrow group of young, very high–volume endurance athletes might face unique bowel stress that could increase their odds of developing precancerous changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/colon-cancer-rates-are-rising-among-young-people-could-changes-to-childrens-gut-bacteria-explain-why-255176"&gt;Young people with colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; has been called a new  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="172173" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;epidemic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/bowel-cancer-is-on-the-rise-in-under-50s-heres-what-might-explain-the-trend-246447"&gt;we don't really understand&lt;/a&gt; why it's &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/alcohol-plays-a-major-role-in-new-cancer-cases/"&gt;increasing&lt;/a&gt; so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Inova study deliberately excluded people with known genetic conditions or bowel disease to focus on runners who otherwise seemed low risk. Yet their screening found more advanced lesions than expected for that age group – a pattern outside experts, commenting in the New York Times, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/health/running-colon-cancer.html"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; as worth investigating, not a final answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How might heavy endurance training contribute to bowel changes? One theory focuses on temporary blood flow reductions to the gut during prolonged, intense exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distance runners are familiar with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5675973/"&gt;runner's colitis&lt;/a&gt; – cramping and occasional bleeding after long runs. Repeated cycles of low–oxygen stress, inflammation and tissue repair in the bowel could, theoretically, encourage adenoma development in susceptible people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Inova team highlighted this mechanism based on observations and runners' reports of gut symptoms, though the study didn't directly measure blood flow, oxygen or inflammation markers. It also didn't isolate other lifestyle factors that might matter, such as dehydration strategies, anti–inflammatory drug use, specific nutrition practices, or very low body fat levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as important is what this study doesn't establish. It doesn't prove marathons or ultramarathons cause bowel cancer. It doesn't show most young–onset bowel cancers occur in runners – doctors not involved in the study &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/health/running-colon-cancer.html"&gt;emphasised&lt;/a&gt; that most younger patients with these cancers aren't endurance athletes. And it doesn't address whether more moderate exercise carries similar risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comparison point – the expected rate of &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1309086"&gt;advanced adenomas&lt;/a&gt; in the late 40s – comes from broader population studies, not from a matched control group. That makes the observed difference notable but still preliminary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research is clinically grounded, but its size and design mean it should be seen as a starting point for larger studies rather than a basis for changing general &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/coping/physically/exercise-guidelines"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040842825001064"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there are practical lessons for endurance athletes and doctors. First, persistent blood in stool, changes in bowel habits, unexplained stomach pain, or iron–deficiency anaemia shouldn't be dismissed as "just running".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a community where gut complaints are common and often normalised, it's easy to miss warning signs. The lead oncologist argued that young runners with bleeding after long runs should be offered screening – a stance grounded in the fact that colonoscopy can remove precancerous lesions and prevent cancers developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is more cautious than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/colorectal-cancer/screening/index.html"&gt;current guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for average–risk adults but aligns with individualised, symptom–driven care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, the study reinforces the difference between exercise as medicine and exercise as extreme sport. For &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38920329/"&gt;cancer prevention and overall health&lt;/a&gt;, the strongest &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-024-02748-x"&gt;evidence supports regular&lt;/a&gt;, moderate–to–vigorous &lt;a href="https://cancerci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12935-022-02670-3"&gt;activity&lt;/a&gt;, not necessarily repeated ultra–endurance feats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172178" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172178" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer_642.jpg" alt="bowel polyp" class="wp-image-172178 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172178" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Polyps can be removed during a colonoscopy. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAFwwWUduCY/"&gt;Sebastian Kaulitzki/Science Photo Library/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Careful attention needed – not panic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent conferences highlighted data showing structured exercise after bowel cancer treatment improves long–term outcomes, underlining that physical activity remains one of the most powerful, low–cost tools in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6527123/"&gt;cancer prevention and care&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This runner study doesn't contradict that larger story. It flags a potential exception at the extreme end of training that needs careful attention, not panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If future research confirms a link, what might change? Screening recommendations could evolve for a clearly defined group of high–volume endurance athletes, perhaps starting colonoscopy earlier than the current age–45 threshold for average–risk adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athletes and coaches might adapt training, nutrition and recovery to protect gut health – paying attention to hydration, heat stress, gradual progression, and avoiding unnecessary anti–inflammatory medication around long efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sports medicine and gastroenterology clinics might work together on protocols for evaluating gut bleeding in runners, narrowing the gap between &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10116569/"&gt;"common" and "concerning"&lt;/a&gt; symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these steps depend on replication in larger, diverse groups and understanding which components of endurance life – intensity, duration, heat, altitude, nutrition – matter most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, a balanced message serves the public best. Endurance running is a profound source of meaning and health for many people, and quitting running isn't the lesson from a single small study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is keeping the proven benefits of exercise in view while being clear–eyed about potential risks at extremes. Listen to your body's signals, especially bleeding. Treat red–flag symptoms as medical, not merely athletic. And discuss personal risk factors and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4955831/"&gt;family history&lt;/a&gt; with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As science probes this signal further, the likely outcome isn't a blanket warning but more nuanced guidance: who might need earlier screening, when to investigate symptoms, and how to train hard with the gut in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's real contribution may be cultural as much as clinical: it gives runners and doctors permission to ask a question they've too often waved away, and to catch dangerous lesions before they become cancers.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263564/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

People who scored higher in traits such as narcissism, psychopathy, and unrestricted sexual desires were more likely to report finding both dates and sexual partners through the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although previous research has explored the psychological profiles of dating app users, there has been less focus on what predicts actual outcomes—such as how many people secure dates or engage in sex as a result of using the apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers wanted to understand not only who uses dating apps, but who succeeds on them. They applied a framework known as life history theory, which suggests that individuals vary in how they allocate effort toward mating and parenting. People with “fast” life history strategies tend to focus on short-term mating and self-enhancement, while those with “slow” strategies prioritize long-term relationships and caregiving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study framed dating apps like Tinder as “digital leks,” drawing from a term in biology. In some animal species, males gather in leks—territories where they display themselves to attract mates but provide no parental investment. Females visit these areas solely to select mating partners. Tinder was considered analogous because it allows people to advertise themselves to a large pool of potential partners in a visually driven, low-effort environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I started my research in the area of dating apps and social media, I dived deeper into theoretical explanations of our behavior,” said study author Lennart Freyth, the founder and research director of the Behavioral and Social Sciences Institute and a professor at HSD Hochschule Döpfer University of Applied Sciences. “Considering personality a behavioral disposition, I was indeed wondering: why was nobody going for the most obvious elements of dating apps? It took a bit to prepare and to present it, but everyone was fine and liked the idea to explore who are the people who go on dates (via these apps) and who engages in sexual intercourse (via these dates/apps).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hypothesized that traits associated with fast life strategies—such as narcissism, psychopathy, and high levels of sociosexual desire—would predict greater dating app success. They were also interested in whether these dynamics differed by sex, and how decision-making styles like “satisficing” (being easily satisfied) or seeking alternative options might factor in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their new study, the research team surveyed 495 German-speaking adults, including 288 men and 207 women, aged 16 to 70 years. Participants were recruited online and received a small monetary incentive for their participation. Each person completed a series of questionnaires measuring various traits and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used validated scales to assess the three so-called “Dark Triad” traits—narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy—as well as components of sociosexuality, which include attitudes toward casual sex, sexual desire, and previous sexual behavior. They also measured decision-making styles related to dating, such as how easily participants felt satisfied with potential matches or how often they searched for alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were asked whether they had ever gone on a date arranged through a dating app (referred to as a “Tinder-date”) and whether they had ever had sex with someone they met on such an app (“Tinder-sex”). The researchers then examined which personality and behavioral traits predicted each outcome, using statistical analyses that accounted for sex differences and interaction effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 31 percent of participants reported having gone on a date via Tinder or a similar app, with no significant difference between men and women. However, among those who reported having sex with someone they met on a dating app, men were more likely than women to do so—66 percent of those who had Tinder-sex were men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who reported either dating or having sex through Tinder tended to be younger and displayed traits associated with fast life strategies. For example, they scored higher in narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and all three aspects of sociosexuality: more favorable attitudes toward casual sex, greater sexual desire, and more sexual experience. These traits were generally stronger predictors of sexual outcomes than of dating alone, suggesting that sexual style becomes more relevant as the encounter progresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men who reported having sex via Tinder were especially likely to score higher in psychopathy and sexual desire. This pattern did not hold for men who had not had Tinder-sex or for women in either group. The authors suggest that psychopathy in this context may not only reflect exploitative tendencies but may also indicate a strategic ability to identify others who are open to uncommitted sex. This aligns with &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/people-with-more-narcissistic-and-psychopathic-traits-report-having-a-higher-number-of-sexual-partners/" target="_blank"&gt;previous findings&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/psychopathic-men-have-an-extreme-focus-on-mating-at-the-expense-of-other-domains-and-tend-be-parasitic-fathers/" target="_blank"&gt;psychopathic men&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/psychopathic-men-have-more-children-study-finds/" target="_blank"&gt;may be more successful&lt;/a&gt; in short-term mating, particularly in environments with high mate availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who had sex with someone from a dating app were more likely to report being easily satisfied with their choices compared to women who did not. This trait, known as satisficing, did not differ significantly among men. One interpretation is that these women may have invested more effort in selecting potential partners during the messaging phase and were more willing to accept some mismatch or disappointment in person. Another possibility is that this reflects increased sexual agency or a strategy aimed at maximizing reproductive opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that decision-making traits such as alternative search (constantly looking for better options) did not significantly predict mating success. This may suggest that once a match leads to an actual date, being less selective or more focused on present opportunities plays a larger role than ongoing comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some differences between men and women appeared, the overall trend showed that fast life strategies, regardless of sex, tend to be linked with greater success in using dating apps to find both dates and sexual partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a general pattern that emerges when investigating social media use and associated personality traits,” Freyth told PsyPost. “Individuals who have elevated levels of traits associated with a fast life history (like the Dark Triad/Tetrad traits, or sociosexuality) use visual social media platforms more intensely. They also report more dates and sex—here, for instance, men high in psychopathy and sociosexuality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yet, women who reported sex via dating apps lowered their standards (lower satisficing) compared to women not having ‘Tinder-sex.’ We were surprised by women lowering their standards once on a date. We consider this something like a sunk cost effect—after already texting, once on a date, the decision to engage further was already made.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most importantly, while discussing these and similar findings over the years, I made the observation that dating apps are similar to biological leks in the animal kingdom,” Freyth continued. “Meaning, it is a short-term mating environment favoring opportunistic mating behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all research, there are some limitations to consider. First, the use of self-reported data on sexual behavior may be influenced by social desirability or gendered reporting biases—men may overreport and women may underreport their experiences. The study was also cross-sectional, meaning it cannot determine causality or track how these behaviors change over time. Longitudinal or experimental research would be needed to assess whether fast life strategies cause greater dating app success or simply emerge as a result of using the apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Compared to most studies on dating apps, our sample was relatively old (the average age was around 40 years),” Freyth noted. “We consider it possible that the effects are underestimated here, as younger people are more opportunistic by nature and due to their current socialization (see, e.g., Haidt’s Anxious Generation). As we have some studies on the topic—one was even replicated—I do not consider a severe shortcoming here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recommend future research explore how these short-term strategies impact broader aspects of life, such as long-term relationship formation, parenting, and even moral decision-making. They also argue that dating apps should be more openly discussed in academic and public discourse and that researchers should not shy away from controversial or sexually charged topics due to stigma or potential backlash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Scientifically, I would like to see how the short-term-oriented behavior affects other regions of our daily lives, from partner choice, love, and also moral decisions—from the individual to a societal level,” Freyth explained. “In general, after having done several studies on dating apps (and social media) and associated personality traits, I would like to see it as a normalized part of the scientific and public debate. Our scientific peers are very interested in private but do not publicly show their interest. I think scholars should accept science as science, and we, as scientists, in general, should be more liberal in discussing topics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study was a hard fight over almost two years to publish,” Freyth added. “It took nine rounds of revisions until the editor-in-chief decided to publish it, after I kindly asked them to look into it. The text was forced to take up relatively unrelated topics because the reviewers disliked the results and approach. Then, we had a similar follow-up study, which was retracted as the results followed up on men and women cheating via dating apps. I filed a complaint after the fifth internal revision following publication. I think people should differentiate their personal stance on things from research and scientific findings. I personally, as a younger man, struggled to find a job simply because I touched these research topics. Indeed, I would like to share more about this, but to keep it short, I will end here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2023.0256" target="_blank"&gt;Dating App Users: Interpersonal Styles and Self-Reported Mating Success&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Lennart Freyth and Peter K.

&lt;p&gt;Strokes are a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/facts.htm" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929758" data-affiliate="true"&gt;leading cause of death in the US&lt;/a&gt;, with nearly 800,000 people experiencing one every year. On average, a stroke occurs every 40 seconds in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These numbers are jarring and scary, especially for folks who have a family history of stroke or who have risk factors like high blood pressure and certain heart conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you can arm yourself with knowledge to recognize the symptoms of a stroke, understand the risk factors and ultimately help protect yourself from experiencing one altogether. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1649629932/brandon-giglio" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929758" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Brandon Giglio&lt;/a&gt;, the director of vascular neurology at NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn, about 85% of strokes in the United States are ischemic strokes, meaning they’re caused by a lack of blood flow to the brain. About 15% are hemorrhagic strokes, which occur when a blood vessel ruptures in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And among the people who have strokes, many also experience what is known as a warning stroke in the days, weeks or months beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what to know about warning strokes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning strokes are known medically as transient ischemic attacks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to most people outside of the medical field, warning strokes are a fleeting yet very dangerous medical condition that can be precursors to full-blown strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, up to one in five people who experience a warning stroke could have a stroke within 90 days if they don’t get medical attention, according to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/24305-ahmed-itrat" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929758" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Ahmed Itrat&lt;/a&gt;, the stroke medical director at Cleveland Clinic Akron General.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what exactly is a warning stroke? Medically, it’s referred to as a transient ischemic attack and causes “sudden-onset transient symptoms of neurological injury which resolve on their own,” Itrat said. “These symptoms may be similar to what one would consider a stroke, but the only difference is they don’t lead to a permanent neurological injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, transient ischemic attacks come on quickly, last for a short time, and do not result in the type of brain damage that can be seen with full-fledged strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the lack of potential brain damage does not mean you should ignore a transient ischemic attack. It’s still a medical condition that needs to be taken seriously, Giglio said. “It really is a harbinger in many people for someone who is going to have a stroke even within the next 48 hours and certainly within the next seven, 30, 90 days,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transient ischemic attacks are also commonly referred to as “ministrokes.” But &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.columbia.edu/profile/joshua-z-willey-md" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929758" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Joshua Willey&lt;/a&gt;, a stroke neurology expert at Columbia University’s Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, said this problematic term minimizes the emergent nature of the condition. The phrase “warning strokes,” on the other hand, highlights that this condition is an emergency, just like a “regular” stroke, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The signs of transient ischemic attacks and strokes are the same.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would say that basically all the same signs and symptoms of a stroke are the signs and symptoms of a transient ischemic attack,” Giglio said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three experts who spoke with HuffPost referred to “&lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/stroke-warning-signs" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929758" data-affiliate="true"&gt;BE FAST&lt;/a&gt;” as a widely accepted mnemonic device detailing the signs of stroke. And as the acronym suggests, these symptoms come on quickly, Giglio said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what it means:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;alance — changes in balance or a loss of balance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;yesight — changes in vision, like blurriness, loss of sight, or double vision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;acial droop — drooping of the face or an uneven smile.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;rm — arm weakness on one side of the body.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;peech — changes in speech, like slurring words or speaking gibberish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;ime — it’s time to call emergency services. According to Willey, the “t” can also stand for the terrible headache that comes on fast.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You could have all of those symptoms, you could have one of those symptoms or any mixture in between,” Giglio said. So, don’t wait around for more than one sign. If you notice any of these issues, go to the emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outbreak soon became the worst the United States has endured in over three decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the month after Donald Trump took office, his administration &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25502931-acting-hhs-secretary-communications-memo-1-21-25/"&gt;interfered with&lt;/a&gt; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention communications, &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/cdc-trump-mmwr-bird-flu-studies-blocked-meddling/"&gt;stalled&lt;/a&gt; the agency’s &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/cdc-data-analyses-missing-mmwr-bird-flu-seasonal-influenza/"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/01/cdc-dei-scientific-data/681531/"&gt;censored&lt;/a&gt; its data, and abruptly &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/14/politics/probationary-federal-employees-agencies-firings-doge"&gt;laid off&lt;/a&gt; staff. In the chaos, CDC experts felt restrained from talking openly with local public health workers, according to interviews with seven CDC officials with direct knowledge of events, as well as local health department emails obtained by KFF Health News through public records requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“CDC hasn’t reached out to us locally,” Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, Texas, wrote in a Feb. 5 email exchange with a colleague two weeks after children with measles were hospitalized in Lubbock. “My staff feels like we are out here all alone,” &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/170_4ea49e.pdf"&gt;she added&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A child would die before CDC scientists contacted Wells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All of us at CDC train for this moment, a massive outbreak,” one CDC researcher told KFF Health News, which agreed not to name CDC officials who fear retaliation for speaking with the press. “All this training and then we weren’t allowed to do anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delays have catastrophic consequences when measles spreads in undervaccinated communities, like many in West Texas. If a person with measles is in the same room with 10 unvaccinated people, nine will be infected, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html"&gt;researchers estimate&lt;/a&gt;. If those nine go about their lives in public spaces, numbers multiply exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak that unfolded in West Texas illustrates the danger the country faces under the Trump administration as vaccination &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm"&gt;rates drop&lt;/a&gt;, misinformation flourishes, public health budgets are cut, and science agencies are subject to political manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Trump administration stifled CDC communications, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/"&gt;fueled doubt&lt;/a&gt; in vaccines and exaggerated &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-on-vitamin-a-unsupported-therapies-for-measles/"&gt;the ability of vitamins&lt;/a&gt; to ward off disease. Suffering followed: The &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;Texas outbreak&lt;/a&gt; spread to &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/health-education/acute-disease-service/rash-illness/measles.html"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2314/Measles-Outbreak-Data"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/press-release/public-health-officials-release-information-on-potential-measles-exposures"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.gob.mx/salud/documentos/situacion-epidemiologica-de-enfermedades-prevenibles-por-vacunacion"&gt;Mexico’s Chihuahua state&lt;/a&gt; — at minimum. Together these &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm"&gt;linked outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; have sickened more than 4,500 people, killed at least 16, and levied exorbitant costs on hospitals, health departments, and those paying medical bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is absolutely outrageous,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. “When you’re battling contagious diseases, time is everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The CDC is ‘stressed’ currently”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells was anxious the moment she learned that two unvaccinated children hospitalized in &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/texas-measles-outbreak-gaines-county-public-health-measles-vaccine/"&gt;late January&lt;/a&gt; had the measles. Hospitals are legally required to report measles cases to health departments and the CDC, but Wells worried many children weren’t getting tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think this may be very large,” she wrote in a &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/124_125.pdf"&gt;Feb. 3 email&lt;/a&gt; to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Wells relayed in &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/124_125.pdf"&gt;another email&lt;/a&gt; what she’d learned from conversations around town: “According to one of the women I spoke with 55 children were absent from one school on 1/24. The women reported that there were sick children with measles symptoms as early as November.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that email &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/251.pdf"&gt;and others&lt;/a&gt;, Wells asked state health officials to put her in touch with CDC experts who could answer complicated questions on testing, how to care for infants exposed to measles, and more. What transpired was a plodding game of telephone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/164.pdf"&gt;One email&lt;/a&gt; asked whether clinics could decontaminate rooms where people with measles had just been if the clinics were too small to follow the CDC’s recommendation to keep those rooms empty for two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Would it be possible to arrange a consultation with the CDC?” Wells wrote on Feb. 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It never hurts to ask the CDC,” said Scott Milton, a medical officer at the Texas health department. About 25 minutes later, he told Wells that an information specialist at the CDC had echoed the guidelines advising two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I asked him to escalate this question to someone more qualified,” &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/163.pdf"&gt;Milton wrote&lt;/a&gt;. “Of course, we know the CDC is ‘stressed’ currently.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local officials resorted to advice from doctors and researchers outside the government, including those at the &lt;a href="https://immunizeusa.org/"&gt;Immunization Partnership&lt;/a&gt;, a Texas nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The CDC had gone dark,” said Terri Burke, executive director of the partnership. “We had anticipated a measles outbreak, but we didn’t expect the federal government to be in collapse when it hit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically, the Trump administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25502931-acting-hhs-secretary-communications-memo-1-21-25/"&gt;freeze on federal communications&lt;/a&gt; had ended Feb. 1. However, CDC scientists told KFF Health News that they could not speak freely for weeks after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was a lot of confusion and nonanswers over what communications were allowed,” one CDC scientist said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said the situation was not unique to measles. “Like most public health organizations, we weren’t able to get ahold of our program people in February,” he said. Information trickled out through the CDC’s communications office, but CDC scientists gave no press briefings and went dark on their closest partners across the country. “The CDC was gagged,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through private conversations, Benjamin learned that CDC experts were being diverted to remove information from websites to comply with executive orders. And they were afraid to resume communication without a green light from their directors or the Department of Health and Human Services as they watched the Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/14/nx-s1-5297913/cdc-layoffs-hhs-trump-doge"&gt;lay off&lt;/a&gt; CDC staffers in droves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not that the CDC was delinquent,” Benjamin said. “It’s that they had their hands tied behind their backs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To work on the ground, the CDC needs an invitation from the state. But Anne Schuchat, a former CDC deputy director, said that during her 33 years with the agency, federal health officials didn’t need special permission to talk freely with local health departments during outbreaks. “We would always offer a conversation and ask if there’s anything we could do,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lara Anton, a press officer at the Texas health department, said the state never prevented the CDC from calling county officials. To learn more about the state’s correspondences with the CDC, KFF Health News filed a public records request to the Texas health department. The department refused to release the records. Anton called the records “confidential under the Texas Health and Safety Code.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anton said the state sent vaccines, testing supplies, and staff to assist West Texas in the early weeks of February. That’s &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Email-State-Vaccines-To-Holbrooks_Redacted.pdf"&gt;corroborated in emails&lt;/a&gt; from the South Plains Public Health District, which oversees Gaines County, the area hit hardest by measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Texas will try to handle what it needs to before it goes to the CDC,” Zach Holbrooks, the health district’s executive director, told KFF Health News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to an outbreak in an undervaccinated community, however, requires enormous effort. To keep numbers from exploding, public health workers ideally would notify all people exposed to an infected person and ask them to get vaccinated immediately if they weren’t already. If they declined, officials would try to persuade them to avoid public spaces for three weeks so that they wouldn’t spread measles to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holbrooks said this was nearly impossible. Cases were concentrated in &lt;a href="https://anabaptistworld.org/texas-measles-outbreak-draws-attention-to-traditionalist-mennonite-community/"&gt;close-knit Mennonite communities&lt;/a&gt; where people relied on home remedies before seeking medical care. He said many people didn’t want to be tested, didn’t want to name their contacts, and didn’t want to talk with the health department. “It doesn’t matter what resources I have if people won’t avail themselves of it,” Holbrooks said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, Mennonites faced persecution in other countries, making them leery of interacting with authorities, Holbrooks said. A backlash against covid restrictions deepened that mistrust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason Mennonites may seek to avoid authorities is that some &lt;a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/the-illegal-immigrants-who-love-trump"&gt;live in the U.S. illegally&lt;/a&gt;, having immigrated to Texas from Canada, Mexico, and Bolivia in waves over the past 50 years. &lt;a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/the-illegal-immigrants-who-love-trump"&gt;Locals guess&lt;/a&gt; the population of Seminole, the main city in Gaines County, is &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/124_125.pdf"&gt;far larger&lt;/a&gt; than the &lt;a href="https://demographics.texas.gov/Resources/TDC/Conference/b5dd2dd3-e840-45db-9e1d-8b450bd37c74/20230524_2020CensusUndercountEngagingTexas.pdf"&gt;U.S. Census&lt;/a&gt; count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have no idea how many cases we might have missed, since I don’t know how many people are in the community,” Holbrooks said. “There’s a lot of people in the shadows out here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health experts say the situation in Gaines sounds tough but familiar. Measles tends to take hold in undervaccinated communities, and therefore public health workers must overcome mistrust, misinformation, language barriers, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 450 people — including local health officials, CDC scientists, nurses, and volunteers — helped control a measles outbreak sparked in an Eastern European immigrant community in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9004490/"&gt;Clark County&lt;/a&gt;, Washington, in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Melnick, Clark County’s public health director, said his team spoke with hundreds of unvaccinated people who were exposed. “We were calling them basically every day to see how they were doing and ask them not to go out in public,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Melnick spoke with CDC scientists from the start, and the intensity of the response was buoyed by emergency declarations by the county and the state. Within a couple of months, the outbreak was largely contained. No one died, and only two people were hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, hundreds of people in the city’s health department responded to a larger measles outbreak in 2018 and 2019 concentrated among Orthodox Jewish communities. The work included meeting with dozens of rabbis and distributing booklets to nearly 30,000 households to combat vaccine misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effort cost more than $7 million, but Jane Zucker, New York City’s assistant health commissioner at the time, said it yielded immense savings. The average medical bill for measles hospitalizations is roughly $18,500, according to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8103967/"&gt;data from prior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33712549/"&gt;outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;. Then there’s the cost of diverting hospital resources, of children missing school, of parents staying home from work to care for sick kids, and &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay6485"&gt;the lasting toll&lt;/a&gt; of some measles infections, including &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/opinion/vaccine-hesitancy.html"&gt;deafness or worse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think there’s a price tag to put on a child’s death that would otherwise be prevented,” Zucker said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local health departments in West Texas were understaffed from the start. About 18 people work at the South Plains health department, which oversees four vast rural counties. About 50 staff the department in Lubbock, where patients were hospitalized and health workers struggled to figure out who was exposed. In mid-February, Wells &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/401.pdf"&gt;emailed a colleague&lt;/a&gt;: “I’m so overwhelmed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A death ignites a response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 26, Texas announced that &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-first-death-measles-outbreak"&gt;a 6-year-old child had died&lt;/a&gt; of measles. Wells heard from CDC scientists for the first time the following day. Also that day, the CDC issued a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-statement-on-measles-outbreak.html"&gt;brief notice&lt;/a&gt; on the outbreak. The notice recommended vaccines, but it worried public health specialists because it also promoted vitamin A as a treatment under medical supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/278_46af73.pdf"&gt;In emails&lt;/a&gt;, Texas health officials privately discussed how the CDC’s notice might exacerbate &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/science-speaks-blog/2025/talking-to-patients-about-measles-vitamin-a-and-the-importance-of-vaccination/"&gt;a problem&lt;/a&gt;: Doctors were &lt;a href="https://www.tpr.org/public-health/2025-03-27/west-texas-children-treated-for-vitamin-a-toxicity-as-medical-disinformation-spreads-alongside-measles-outbreak"&gt;treating children&lt;/a&gt; with measles for toxic levels of vitamin A, suggesting that parents were delaying medical care and administering the supplements at home. A local Lubbock news outlet &lt;a href="https://www.everythinglubbock.com/video/%e2%80%98its-been-flying-off-the-shelf%e2%80%99-lubbock-pharmacy-sees-more-vitamin-a-and-cod-liver-oil-purchases-amidst-west-texas-measles-outbreak/10533712/"&gt;reported on a large drugstore&lt;/a&gt; where vitamin A supplements and cod liver oil, which contains high levels of vitamin A, were “flying off the shelf.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too much vitamin A can cause liver damage, blindness, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10788247/"&gt;dire abnormalities&lt;/a&gt; during fetal development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milton worried that parents were listening to misinformation from anti-vaccine groups — including &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/authors/robert-f-kennedy-jr/"&gt;one founded&lt;/a&gt; by Kennedy — that diminished the need for vaccination by &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/science-speaks-blog/2025/talking-to-patients-about-measles-vitamin-a-and-the-importance-of-vaccination/"&gt;inaccurately claiming&lt;/a&gt; that vitamin A staved off the disease’s worst outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How many people will choose Vitamin A and not a vaccine because it appears to them there are two options?” Milton asked &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/278_46af73.pdf"&gt;in an email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the CDC privately fretted, too. “HHS pressed us to insert vitamin A into all of our communications with clinicians and health officials,” one CDC scientist told KFF Health News, referring to the agency’s notices and alerts. “If pregnant women took too much vitamin A during the outbreak, their babies could be profoundly disabled. We haven’t seen those babies born yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another CDC official said they’ve had to “walk a fine line” between protecting the public based on scientific evidence and aligning with HHS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While CDC scientists held their tongues, Kennedy exaggerated the power of nutrition and vitamin A while furthering mistrust in vaccines. “We’re providing vitamin A,” Kennedy said in an interview on &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;. “There are many studies, some showing 87% effectiveness,” he claimed, “against serious disease and death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://methods.cochrane.org/equity/vitamin-measles#:~:text=for%20disadvantaged%20communities-,Vitamin%20A%20reduces%20the%20risk%20of%20death%20from%20measles%20by,measles%2Drelated%20deaths%20and%20complications"&gt;studies Kennedy referenced&lt;/a&gt; were conducted in low-income countries where children are malnourished. Evidence suggests that vitamin A supplementation is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12271920/pdf/main.pdf"&gt;seldom useful&lt;/a&gt; against measles in the United States, because deficiency is exceedingly rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy deflected criticism from those who call him anti-vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112"&gt;saying that&lt;/a&gt; any parent in Texas who wants a measles vaccine can get one. He followed this with dangerously &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/"&gt;inaccurate statements&lt;/a&gt;. “There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year,” he said. “It causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes, encephalitis and blindness, et cetera.” There is &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/"&gt;no evidence&lt;/a&gt; that measles vaccines “cause deaths every year.” Scores of studies show that the vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004407.pub5/full"&gt;doesn’t cause&lt;/a&gt; encephalitis, that most potential side effects resolve quickly on their own, and serious adverse reactions are far rarer than measles complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/rfk-jr-mmr-vaccine-fetus-b2742886.html"&gt;another interview,&lt;/a&gt; Kennedy said, “The MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris.” The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-vaccines-do-not-contain-fetal-cells-thimerosal/?srsltid=AfmBOooFb-cjKAkF4bdqTZQGSfABTYTou4a103IbBEydq3cDgzmGs1xo"&gt;does not contain&lt;/a&gt; an iota of fetal cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon and spokespeople at the CDC did not respond to queries from KFF Health News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Staff are exhausted”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite national attention after the country’s first measles death in a decade, West Texas was overwhelmed. In late February and March, hospital administrators and health officials exchanged emails about how to lobby for resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Local hospitals are at capacity,” &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/257_bdb6df.pdf"&gt;wrote Jeffrey Hill&lt;/a&gt;, a senior vice president at the University Medical Center Health System in Lubbock. “The state reports emergency funds that typically cover a response like the measles outbreak are not available from the federal government right now,” &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/260.pdf"&gt;he added.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am writing to express our urgent need for additional staff and funding,” Ronald Cook, medical director for Lubbock, said in &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/104.png"&gt;an email&lt;/a&gt;, drafted with other Lubbock health authorities, to the deputy city manager. “Our Capacity is Stretched Thin: The health department has been operating seven days a week since February 2nd. Staff are exhausted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of Lubbock fronted money to help the local health department hire temporary staff. The state did not provide money, but it asked the CDC to send epidemiologists. Some came to Texas in early March. Then Texas requested federal funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None arrived, even as the outbreak approached 500 cases. It &lt;a href="https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/measles-takes-root-mexico"&gt;spread to Mexico&lt;/a&gt; when an unvaccinated Mennonite child returned home after visiting family in Seminole. This would fuel the largest outbreak Mexico has seen &lt;a href="https://liberties.aljazeera.com/en/mexico-grapples-with-its-worst-measles-outbreak-in-decades/"&gt;in decades&lt;/a&gt;, with at least 3,700 cases and &lt;a href="https://www.gob.mx/salud/documentos/situacion-epidemiologica-de-enfermedades-prevenibles-por-vacunacion"&gt;13 deaths&lt;/a&gt; in the state of Chihuahua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then another child in West Texas &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak"&gt;died of measles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a rare moment of openness, CDC scientist David Sugarman mentioned the outbreak at a vaccine &lt;a href="https://tinalexander.github.io/notes/2025/04"&gt;advisory meeting&lt;/a&gt; in late April. “There are quite a number of resource requests coming in, in particular from Texas,” Sugarman said. “We are scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal funds arrived in Texas on May 21, said Anton, the state health department spokesperson. By then, the crisis was fading. The outbreak seemed to have burned until every unvaccinated person in Seminole was infected, said Richard Eby, a doctor at Permian Regional Medical Center who treated some measles patients. Hundreds, if not thousands, of cases have probably gone undetected, he said. “A lot of people presumed their kids had measles,” he said, “and didn’t see the need to confirm it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Aug. 18, health officials declared the West Texas &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-end-west-texas-measles-outbreak"&gt;outbreak over&lt;/a&gt;, but the consequences of the catastrophe will be lasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreaks it sparked across the U.S. and Mexico are still spreading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More are inevitable, Nuzzo said. A growing number of parents are deciding &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/measles-elimination-status-what-it-is-and-how-the-u-s-could-lose-it/"&gt;not to vaccinate&lt;/a&gt; their kids, worried over unfounded rumors about the shots. Misinformation is flourishing, especially after Kennedy fired vaccine experts who advise the CDC and replaced them with doctors and researchers &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/kennedy-rfk-vaccine-panel-acip-cdc-hhs-immunizations/"&gt;on the fringes&lt;/a&gt; of the scientific establishment. For example, one of his recent appointees, Robert Malone, &lt;a href="https://x.com/RWMaloneMD/status/1908665463279677915"&gt;blamed the deaths of children&lt;/a&gt; with measles on “medical mismanagement,” &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/16/texas-measles-misinformation-vaccines/"&gt;without evidence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, states are downsizing programs for emergency response, disease surveillance, and immunization after the Trump administration clawed back more than &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/health/trump-state-health-grants-cuts.html"&gt;$11 billion&lt;/a&gt; in public health funds earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid Lubbock’s toughest months, Wells sent &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/253.pdf"&gt;an email&lt;/a&gt; to the department’s exhausted staff. “The future is uncertain, and I know this is an unsettling time for many of us,” she wrote. “Every day we show up and do our jobs is an act of resilience.”&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychotherapy leads to measurable changes in brain structure. Researchers at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU) and the University of Münster have demonstrated this for the first time in a study in &lt;i&gt;Translational Psychiatry&lt;/i&gt; by using cognitive behavioral therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;
     
     
     &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7587637799"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
     
&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The team analyzed the brains of 30 patients suffering from acute depression. After therapy, most of them showed changes in areas responsible for processing emotions. The observed effects are similar to those already known from studies on medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 280 million people suffer from &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/severe+depression/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;severe depression&lt;/a&gt; worldwide. This depression leads to changes in the brain mass of the anterior hippocampus and amygdala. Both areas are part of the limbic system and are primarily responsible for processing and controlling emotions. In &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/psychotherapy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;psychotherapy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+behavioral+therapy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; (CBT) is an established method for treating depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"CBT leads to positive changes in thought patterns, emotions and behavior. We assume that this process is also linked to functional and structural changes in the brain. The effect has already been demonstrated with therapy involving medication or electrostimulation, but has not yet been proven for psychotherapy in general," says Professor Ronny Redlich, who heads the Department of Biological and Clinical Psychology at MLU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the researchers have succeeded in demonstrating this in their study. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to examine the participants' brains before and after 20 sessions of therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"MRI scans provide information about the size, shape and location of tissue," explains psychologist Esther Zwiky from MLU. In addition to the MRI scans, clinical interviews were conducted to analyze the symptoms of the disease, such as difficulty in identifying and describing feelings. In addition, 30 healthy control subjects, who did not undergo therapy, participated in the study for comparison purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study provided clear results: 19 of the 30 patients were found to have hardly any acute depressive symptoms after therapy. The researchers were also able, for the first time, to document specific anatomical changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We observed a significant increase in the volume of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gray+matter/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gray matter&lt;/a&gt; in the left amygdala and the right anterior hippocampus," says Zwiky. The researchers found a clear connection to the symptoms: Individuals with a greater increase in gray matter in the amygdala also showed a stronger reduction in their emotional dysregulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Cognitive behavioral therapy was already known to work. Now, for the first time, we have a reliable biomarker for the effect of psychotherapy on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+structure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain structure&lt;/a&gt;. Put simply, psychotherapy changes the brain," explains Redlich. However, Redlich stresses that there is no fundamentally better or worse treatment—medication works better for some people, while electrostimulation works very well for others; for others, CBT can be most helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is therefore all the more encouraging that we were able to show in our study that psychotherapy is an equally effective alternative from a medical and scientific standpoint," says Redlich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Best Ways To Optimize Your Digestion As You Get Older&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this is understandably frustrating and concerning. But experts stress there are ways to minimize any effects from age-related stomach issues. They recommend:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chewing Better&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better digestion begins in the mouth. “Salivary enzymes help digest starch and fat in the mouth, decreasing the GI tract’s workload,” Mutha said. “The alkaline pH of saliva also helps neutralize acid in the esophagus due to reflux and alleviate GERD symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonus: Cutting your food into smaller pieces and chewing at least 15 to 20 times per bite can help mitigate any complications associated with trouble swallowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stimulating Saliva Production&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saliva production tends to decrease as we age, which can affect chewing and swallowing, Sohi said. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.ada.org/en/resources/research/science-and-research-institute/oral-health-topics/xerostomia" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929636" data-affiliate="true"&gt;American Dental Association&lt;/a&gt;, dry mouth is twice as likely to strike when you take one or more medications daily, compared with people with no medications on their roster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things like regularly using an over-the-counter saliva substitute or sipping water between bites can be helpful if dry mouth is a problem for you at mealtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eating More Food That’s Plant-Based, Less That’s Processed &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to optimize digestion is to eat a diet as low in processed foods and high in plant-based diversity as possible. “Diets high in processed food can alter the gut microbiome, leading to dysbiosis,” Sohi said, an unhealthy balance of gut bacteria that’s associated with higher rates of digestive disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides keeping your gut microbiome on the rails, going plant-based is the best way to increase your fiber intake, which is crucial to the quality and consistency of your number two sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber — soluble and insoluble — is what bulks up your poop, Mutha explained. This not only makes your time on the throne more pleasant and efficient, but it also decreases the likelihood of fecal incontinence and even helps treat diarrhea by absorbing water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staying Hydrated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydration is crucial to avoid constipation, Mutha said, especially once you start upping your fiber intake. The &lt;a href="https://www.ncoa.org/article/how-to-stay-hydrated-for-better-health" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929636" data-affiliate="true"&gt;National Council on Aging&lt;/a&gt; recommends drinking one-third of your weight in fluid ounces daily. That means if you weigh 150 pounds, then you should be drinking 50 ounces (or 6¼ cups) of water per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving More&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exercise stimulates the motility of the GI tract, so this can be very helpful for digestion,” Sohi said. “Lying recumbent on the couch after eating is one of the worst things you can do because not only does it not help with GI tract motility, but it can also promote acid reflux.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mutha agrees and recommends walking for roughly 15 minutes after your meals to help activate your stomach and improve gastric emptying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting Enough Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is a healing mechanism for the body, so not getting enough quality shut-eye — the recommendation is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about_sleep/how_much_sleep.html" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929636" data-affiliate="true"&gt;seven to nine hours per night&lt;/a&gt; — can adversely affect your gut barrier and immunity, Mutha said. Researchers are still nailing down the exact mechanisms behind how, but one theory is that &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4849511/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929636" data-affiliate="true"&gt;sleep deprivation&lt;/a&gt; leads to an increase in microscopic inflammation in the bowel that may domino into gastrointestinal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mastering Your Medications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any and every medicine has GI side effects — even the ones that are prescribed for GI illnesses,” Mutha said. “Making sure you take your medications exactly as prescribed decreases the risk of side effects.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NSAIDs should never be consumed on an empty stomach, for instance, while acid-suppressive medicines should be taken 30 minutes before breakfast. But if side effects happen anyway, let your doctor know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When To Check In With Your Doctor About Your Digestive Issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you’re confident the digestive drama you’re experiencing is aging-related or a sign your lifestyle needs a revamp, “it’s important to not assume” and to “share your symptoms with your doctor anyway, as sometimes there can be a more serious underlying cause,” said &lt;a href="https://www.templehealth.org/doctors/neena-mohan" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929636" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Neena Mohan&lt;/a&gt;, gastroenterologist and assistant professor of clinical medicine at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If, in addition to persistent changes in bowel habits, you’re also experiencing trouble swallowing, abdominal pain, nausea and/or vomiting, unexplained weight loss or have noticed blood in your poop (or it looks black and tarry), it’s time for a consultation with a gastroenterologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Depending on the issue, your doctor may start with bloodwork and prescribe medications or do further testing, such as an endoscopy or colonoscopy,” Attalla said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/stomach-pain-increase-age_l_650c3421e4b0e83cc0da8dcf" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929636"&gt;HuffPost&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But few are more of a bummer than the way our digestive system seems to lose interest in, well, digesting things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Intestinal issues can arise at any age and can become more prevalent as we age,” &lt;a href="https://providers.inspirahealthnetwork.org/provider/Sara+Attalla/1999340" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Sara Attalla;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Sara Attalla&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist at Inspira Health in &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/carolinekee/what-is-adenovirus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:New Jersey;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, told HuffPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Roughly &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/digestive-diseases" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:60 million to 70 million Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;60 million to 70 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; are affected by digestive diseases, according to the National Institutes of Health. Some of the most common symptoms? Heartburn, bloating, abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits (as in constipation, diarrhea or even a combo of the two).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nailing down what’s causing your digestive drama can be tricky since it’s a multi-faceted problem that typically stems from a highly individual combination of aging and lifestyle-related culprits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How The Aging Process Can Affect Digestion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As we age, the nerves and muscles in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can start to glitch, resulting in changes to how our digestive organs function individually and work together — usually, this translates into the digestion process itself becoming sluggish and communication signals between digestive organs getting haphazard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Movement within the esophagus and muscles involved in swallowing may not be as effective or coordinated, for instance, and can lead to higher rates of esophageal reflux (known as GERD, where your stomach contents start to make a comeback), while slower motility in the stomach can cause what you’ve eaten to linger and trigger indigestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The stomach lining can also become thinner with age, which renders you more susceptible to injury in the stomach from things like inflammation,” Attalla said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Decreased &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24411-prostaglandins" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:prostaglandin production;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;prostaglandin production&lt;/a&gt; over time (a hormone-like substance that plays a role in stomach acid secretion and GI muscle functioning) means a decrease in the protective lining of the stomach, too, leaving you more prone to gastritis and ulcers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The next stop on your food’s digestive journey is a pit stop in the small bowel. “Slower motility here can lead to higher rates of bacterial overgrowth, which can cause bloating and diarrhea,” &lt;a href="https://gastrohealthpartners.com/physicians/dr-sunana-sohi-gastroenterologist-louisville-kentucky/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Sunana Sohi;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Sunana Sohi&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified gastroenterologist at Gastroenterology Health Partners in Louisville, Kentucky, told HuffPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And if motility screeches to a halt in your colon, get ready for possible bouts of constipation and diverticulosis (a condition where small sacs form and push against weak spots in the wall of your colon, putting you at risk of symptom flareups, such as bleeding and inflammation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Then there’s the chronic health conditions that tend to stack up as we get older (arthritisis, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases), many of which can cause limitations to the level of movement we can tolerate, further exacerbating gut motility issues. (“If you don’t move, neither does your gut,” &lt;a href="https://www.utphysicians.com/provider/pritesh-mutha/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Pritesh Mutha;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Pritesh Mutha&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth Houston, told HuffPost.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As for the medications we take to manage these conditions (both prescription and over-the-counter, especially NSAID pain relievers such ad aspirin and ibuprofen), they’re known to cause gastro-themed side effects of their own.

According to the &lt;a href="https://www.ada.org/en/resources/research/science-and-research-institute/oral-health-topics/xerostomia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Dental Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American Dental Association&lt;/a&gt;, dry mouth is twice as likely to strike when you take one or more medications daily, compared with people with no medications on their roster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Things like regularly using an over-the-counter saliva substitute or sipping water between bites can be helpful if dry mouth is a problem for you at mealtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eating More Food That’s Plant-Based, Less That’s Processed &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The best way to optimize digestion is to eat a diet as low in processed foods and high in plant-based diversity as possible. “Diets high in processed food can alter the gut microbiome, leading to dysbiosis,” Sohi said, an unhealthy balance of gut bacteria that’s associated with higher rates of digestive disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Besides keeping your gut microbiome on the rails, going plant-based is the best way to increase your fiber intake, which is crucial to the quality and consistency of your number two sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fiber — soluble and insoluble — is what bulks up your poop, Mutha explained. This not only makes your time on the throne more pleasant and efficient, but it also decreases the likelihood of fecal incontinence and even helps treat diarrhea by absorbing water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staying Hydrated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hydration is crucial to avoid constipation, Mutha said, especially once you start upping your fiber intake. The &lt;a href="https://www.ncoa.org/article/how-to-stay-hydrated-for-better-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Council on Aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;National Council on Aging&lt;/a&gt; recommends drinking one-third of your weight in fluid ounces daily. That means if you weigh 150 pounds, then you should be drinking 50 ounces (or 6¼ cups) of water per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving More&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Exercise stimulates the motility of the GI tract, so this can be very helpful for digestion,” Sohi said. “Lying recumbent on the couch after eating is one of the worst things you can do because not only does it not help with GI tract motility, but it can also promote acid reflux.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Mutha agrees and recommends walking for roughly 15 minutes after your meals to help activate your stomach and improve gastric emptying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting Enough Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sleep is a healing mechanism for the body, so not getting enough quality shut-eye — the recommendation is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about_sleep/how_much_sleep.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:seven to nine hours per night;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;seven to nine hours per night&lt;/a&gt; — can adversely affect your gut barrier and immunity, Mutha said. Researchers are still nailing down the exact mechanisms behind how, but one theory is that &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4849511/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sleep deprivation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;sleep deprivation&lt;/a&gt; leads to an increase in microscopic inflammation in the bowel that may domino into gastrointestinal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mastering Your Medications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Any and every medicine has GI side effects — even the ones that are prescribed for GI illnesses,” Mutha said. “Making sure you take your medications exactly as prescribed decreases the risk of side effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;NSAIDs should never be consumed on an empty stomach, for instance, while acid-suppressive medicines should be taken 30 minutes before breakfast. But if side effects happen anyway, let your doctor know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When To Check In With Your Doctor About Your Digestive Issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even if you’re confident the digestive drama you’re experiencing is aging-related or a sign your lifestyle needs a revamp, “it’s important to not assume” and to “share your symptoms with your doctor anyway, as sometimes there can be a more serious underlying cause,” said &lt;a href="https://www.templehealth.org/doctors/neena-mohan" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Neena Mohan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Neena Mohan&lt;/a&gt;, gastroenterologist and assistant professor of clinical medicine at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If, in addition to persistent changes in bowel habits, you’re also experiencing trouble swallowing, abdominal pain, nausea and/or vomiting, unexplained weight loss or have noticed blood in your poop (or it looks black and tarry), it’s time for a consultation with a gastroenterologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Depending on the issue, your doctor may start with bloodwork and prescribe medications or do further testing, such as an endoscopy or colonoscopy,” Attalla said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/stomach-pain-increase-age_l_650c3421e4b0e83cc0da8dcf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HuffPost;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;HuffPost&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/ravenishak/green-flags-in-people?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:"That’s The Greenest Flag I Could Think Of": 16 Very Subtle Behaviors That Signal Someone Is A Really, Really Good Person;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link "&gt;"That’s The Greenest Flag I Could Think Of": 16 Very Subtle Behaviors That Signal Someone Is A Really, Really Good Person&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/artemisstardust/tlc-kids-by-the-dozen?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:My Family Was On A TLC Reality Show.
