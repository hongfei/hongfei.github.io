The cause of her colon cancer is unclear, though her doctors suggest antibiotic use could be behind the growing cases in young people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diet, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-a3ca3640-08d5-11f0-b116-3597f85e5054" class=""&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, obesity and sedentary lifestyles are thought to play a role, but Brinlee's case suggests something more complex is at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mariela told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51280522/colon-cancer-in-young-adults-utahn-shares-experience-being-diagnosed-at-21"&gt;KSL News&lt;/a&gt;: 'Having [Brinlee] go through something that I couldn't go through, and I couldn't experience, was just so hard.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brinlee said: 'I don't think anything can prepare you for that moment when you're told you have cancer.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brinlee's oncologist, Dr Mark Lewis of Intermountain Health, said increasing numbers of his patients are under age 45, the time when doctors recommend regular colon cancer screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told KSL News: 'There really is unfortunately no such thing as too young for colon cancer.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While doctors are still &lt;a target="_self" href="/snapchat/article-13906749/A-doctor-blames-two-ingredients-Americas-colon-cancer-crisis.html"&gt;unraveling the causes of America's colon cancer epidemic&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Lewis suggested antibiotic use going all the way back to childhood could be a factor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'Antibiotics in childhood and in adulthood can affect the bacteria that line the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We're being very, very careful about prescribing antibiotics to young people because we do know there is at least a slight increased risk for colon cancer decades later.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because Brinlee and Mariela had such similar lifestyle and dietary habits, the different use of antibiotics in their childhoods may have played a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorectal &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-c28441d0-08ac-11f0-a088-dfe2cc6ff8d4"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; is the fourth most common cancer in the US and the second-leading cause of cancer deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates 154,270 Americans will be diagnosed with colon cancer this year, and 52,900 will die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This includes 19,550 cases and 3,750 deaths in under-50s.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By 2030, colon cancer is estimated to be the biggest cancer killer in patients under 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antibiotic use has been a growing concern among colorectal oncologists, as evidence suggests the drugs could permanently alter protective bacteria lining the intestinal tract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antibiotics, prescribed more than 230million times a year in the US, are meant to kill harmful bacteria, but they also attack the gut's healthy bacteria, which regulate digestion and help the immune system protect against infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This leaves the digestive tract vulnerable to inflammation, which may cause cells to mutate and become cancerous.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rates of colorectal cancer in Americans under 50 have risen over the past two decades. This graph shows the latest year for which data is available&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brinlee, pictured here, underwent 30 rounds of chemotherapy. She has been in remission since December&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brinlee and Mariela, both pictured here, have started a sweatshirt brand to provide easy IV access for people going through chemotherapy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-021-01665-7"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; of more than 40,000 people found antibiotic use was more strongly linked to colon cancer in younger patients than older patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts believe this could be due to a worldwide increase in antibiotic use, as prescriptions have surged 46 percent across the globe since 2000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, experts have also suggested lifestyle factors like obesity, diet, and physical inactivity can also lead to cancer-causing inflammation in the gut.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brinlee underwent 30 rounds of chemotherapy, completing the treatment in December. She is now cancer free. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mariela also had a colonoscopy after her sister's diagnosis, where doctors removed several polyps.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While many of these are harmless, some may develop into cancer due to abnormal cell growth and mutations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mariela said: 'I like to think that she really did save my life in a way because I was headed down that route.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The twins are working to raise awareness and have also created 'The Port Studio,' a line of sweatshirts that provide easy IV access for people going through chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brinlee said: 'I don't want to hide that I had cancer. Sharing your story is uncomfortable, but I want to be able to share it so that people can be inspired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's always room for hope.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This includes treatments for HIV, TB, schizophrenia, chronic pain, or metabolic disease​,” said Dr Giovanni Traverso, a co-author of the study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a gastroenterologist at Brigham and Women’s hospital in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The approach involves injecting micro-crystals of a synthetic version of the hormone progesterone contained in a solvent that does not mix well with water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Once in the body, the solvent exchanges with bodily fluid. However, the micro-crystals prefer to clump together than interact with this water-rich environment. This, together with the formation of further crystals as the solvents exchange, results in the development of a solid implant, capable of releasing the drug slowly over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The team, whose study was published &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44286-025-00194-x" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;in the journal Nature Chemical Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, tested the approach in rats, allowing them to refine the choice of solvent in the injection. The drug release in rats was sustained for at least 97 days, although Traverso said there was potential for longer durations depending on formulation adjustments​.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The dosing and volumes of drug are compatible with multi-year dosing,” he said, adding that the formation of a solid implant means it can be removed if required, while the approach is also compatible with the use of small needles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;However, the research is still in its early stages, with the efficacy of the approach yet to be tested. “It lays the groundwork for future human studies which we hope will start in the next three to five years,” Traverso said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Dr Janet Barter, the president of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, said the approach could be an exciting advancement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“This innovation has the potential to be convenient option for individuals in low-resource settings, where access to contraception and healthcare services can be limited,” she said. “We welcome further research into the safety, efficacy, and the accessibility of this promising technology and encourage the authors to work with potential users in future to ensure they meet the needs and preferences of those who will rely on it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 17:25:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxOeUdydlFXRmFOQUJFZkJSZFAySGd2YlNKYVEzVHItdW11dGRPZGEzM2RReHJlVUw3WXQtV3Y1dkVidEFqUWJ6UEZxQkszc2pMREVPRnBjSlVxTkpkcXIyT1B0NTlVNXFocVNtQWUweUtaQUtTdVNBZDdDQUpIazdhYnQ5N1lzNjRKZHN4d1ZobVc4UGMyeEhHTEFZZ01tRS1fclhvbkxQM25ZeDZmNHU1UzAxWEU1Zw</guid></item><item><title>A healthy diet in midlife may help you reach 70 without chronic disease -

According to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/whole-grains/art-20047826" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, whole grains can help control cholesterol levels, weight and blood pressure, and can help lower the risk of heart disease and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;That doesn’t mean refined grains need to be entirely avoided, experts say. In fact, focusing too much on specific foods and nutrients rather than one’s overall health and lifestyle can have more deleterious effects than eating a slice of white bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Here’s what you need to know about whole grains versus refined grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-difference-between-whole-grains-and-refined-grains" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What is the difference between whole grains and refined grains?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Grains are the edible, dry seeds of grasses grown for food. Every whole-grain kernel is made up of three components, explains Dena Champion, a registered dietitian at the Ohio State University Wexner medical center: a hard outer coating known as bran, a small core known as the germ and a large, starchy middle layer called endosperm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;When a whole-grain kernel is processed to make a refined grain, like white flour, it is stripped of the germ and bran, leaving only the endosperm. The endosperm is the largest component of whole grain, but it also contains the fewest nutrients. Removing the germ and bran from grains also removes significant amounts of fiber, protein, vitamins and minerals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="54b7068d-7ea8-4575-8fc4-2d940bc414b0" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Grains of wheat in a mill in Khanna in India’s Punjab state, on 18 May 2022.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Sajjad Hussain/AFP/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Generally, this processing is performed to create softer flavors and textures, says Champion.

It also helps the body control blood sugar levels by improving insulin sensitivity and reducing one’s risk of diabetes. Fiber also keeps you fuller for longer, Young says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Additionally, as registered dietitian Ashli Greenwald told &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/barley-farro-sorghum-and-more-9-whole-grains-to-try" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Johns Hopkins Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, whole grains contain phytonutrients, which are plant-based compounds that can reduce inflammation and may reduce the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Some whole grains can also be “good sources of protein”, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-risks-of-a-diet-high-in-refined-grains" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What are the risks of a diet high in refined grains?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;By contrast, one of the biggest risks of a diet high in processed and refined grains is not getting adequate fiber, says Champion. “Most Americans are not consuming enough fiber, and consuming more whole grains can have a big impact,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://nutrition.org/most-americans-are-not-getting-enough-fiber-in-our-diets/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;American Society for Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, only 7% of American adults meet current fiber-intake recommendations: 14g of fiber per 1,000 calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4},"elementId":"54bc1961-942c-424e-a992-c44c65a9914b","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="54bc1961-942c-424e-a992-c44c65a9914b" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’" data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99" data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Products made with refined grains are also more likely to be highly processed and to contain added sugar, saturated fat and sodium, Champion says – “for example, a packaged pastry”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Due to the lower levels of fiber and higher levels of highly processed ingredients, diets rich in refined grains are more likely to lead to poor gut health, increased blood sugar spikes and increased inflammation, says Young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-21" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But they are a staple of many cultural cuisines – sushi rice in Japan, for example, or baguettes in France. These &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/08/06/1190900066/japanese-food-diet-healthy-eating" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cultures&lt;/a&gt; “often have &lt;a href="https://www.deliciousmagazine.co.uk/why-are-the-french-healthier-than-brits/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;better&lt;/a&gt; health markers than the US”, Young notes. She adds that these refined grains are merely one part of lifestyles that tend to include smaller portion sizes, less ultra-processed food, more balanced meals and more physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;One’s overall diet is more important for health than any single food, experts say. “No one needs to consume 100% whole grains 100% of the time,” Champion says. In general, she says, a healthy diet contains “whole grains more often than refined, lots of fruit and vegetables and plenty of fiber”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2ea869a9-d394-4526-abef-be879bdabf28" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;White rice as part of a seafood sambal dish at a food stall in Malang, East Java, Indonesia, on 16 January 2025.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The low-carb diet craze of the 90s and early aughts was “more about restricting than swapping or diversifying our diets”, says Malak Saddy, a registered and licensed dietitian. “If you wanted to have carbs, you could only have whole grains,” she recalls. As wonderful as whole grains can be, you “can also find those nutrients in fruits and vegetables”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;It’s important not to oversell the promise of whole grains. As Saddy notes, diet is only one component of overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“If you don’t have access to food, or a safe place to sleep, or you’re not financially stable and don’t have a support system, then you can eat as many whole grains as you want and you still won’t receive the benefits of it,” she says. “Those other determinants are impacting you way more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;What’s more, refined grain products can often be more affordable than whole grain foods. A loaf of Ezekiel sprouted grain bread costs about $8, for example, while a loaf of classic white Wonder &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/bread" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Bread&lt;/a&gt; costs just over $3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Whole grains and refined grains need to be morally neutralized, Saddy says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It becomes a sense of elitism: because I eat whole grains, I am better than you,” she says. This attitude, she argues, creates a dynamic that can contribute to disordered eating patterns where some foods are deemed good and others bad. “That is much more harmful to our health than just eating the white rice or the white tortilla,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Terms like “multigrain”, “wheat” or “made with whole grains” can be clever ways companies try to make products seem whole grain when they’re not, says Young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Instead, experts say, one should look at nutrition labels to determine a product’s ingredients and fiber content. Ingredients like “whole wheat” or “100% whole grain” should be named first on the list of ingredients, Young says. And a true whole grain product should contain at least 3g of fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;One can also buy unprocessed whole grains – for example, quinoa, farro, oats or brown and black rice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 16:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE03VWZ4TGFrd2czRXhyZGZ1ZUdKYjRzTXF0MG8wWTlfQWo2ZU5EWnNxUFp0VDNOWUJuNGs2a3F2c3JwVkhLd3pwQm4ybVA0ZWd6QjBvdzNKcFJfUkcxbXRncmhHaEhhQXNRcmRWc01OU3h3eWRJRVpEMFkyUFNFZw</guid></item><item><title>The Risk of Becoming Allergic to Meat After a Tick Bite May Be Higher Than Thought - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxOZ1NlaVQ5SFhrOE5LUVRsNmROdzdEblAxRDE0TkdkdE5BMDFibkFKV1JORHZ6QTdaV0lkU3hpTGJZckVIazlUWlhzd01CM1FrS3p2UmczTE5GR2lqOUZINmxkc3lXajNUMERfWW45eWRvWV8tYWRubUEta0k1SjgweUdERjhESTNjb1MtRTZMVEVBQzAxQzBpakFsQmg5NnNfTldaa3pvb1UzZEwtNUNaSlFXUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;The tick menace is even worse than we thought. A pair of new studies this month suggests that there are more tick species out there in the U.S. that can cause an unusual form of allergy to red meat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local health officials published the research late last week in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. The studies detail cases of red meat allergy, formally known as alpha-gal syndrome, tied to bites from two tick species not normally associated with it—ticks that also cause Lyme disease. These cases seem rare, but indicate that more people are at risk for the syndrome than currently assumed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alpha-gal is a sugar found in the muscles of most mammals, though importantly not humans. We can normally tolerate the alpha-gal found in the meat we eat without issue. But &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/weird-meat-allergy-caused-by-ticks-may-be-easier-to-cat-1832872448"&gt;for reasons we’re still trying to understand&lt;/a&gt;, a tick bite can sometimes cause our bodies to develop an overactive immune response to alpha-gal, essentially making us allergic to red meat and even dairy. Alpha-gal syndrome is the only type of classic food allergy that involves a sugar (the alpha-gal) rather than a protein. And unlike other food allergies, symptoms might take hours, not minutes, to show up after exposure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the U.S., alpha-gal cases are nearly always associated with the bite of a lone star tick (&lt;em&gt;Amblyomma americanum&lt;/em&gt;), which is predominantly found throughout the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/maps/lone_star_tick.pdf"&gt;eastern half&lt;/a&gt; of the country. But there are different tick species known to cause it in other parts of the world, and doctors stateside have encountered the occasional case in places where the lone star shouldn’t be residing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this latest research, scientists have discovered at least two, but possibly more, cases of alpha-gal that don’t fit the typical description.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/4/24-0577_article"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers documented a woman in Washington who developed alpha-gal in 2017, following a bite from an unknown species of tick. As a result, she switched to a vegetarian diet. Three years later, she got a second tick bite. Though she avoided any symptoms because of her diet, blood tests showed a dramatic rise in antibodies to alpha-gal. This time, she was able to collect the tick for testing, identified as &lt;em&gt;Ixodes pacificus&lt;/em&gt;, or the western black-legged tick. Two years later, she got another bite from an &lt;em&gt;I. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;pacificus&lt;/em&gt; tick and once again experienced a rise in alpha-gal antibodies. Importantly, the woman also reported no recent travel history to places where the lone star tick is found.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/4/24-1265_article"&gt;second study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers traced back a case of alpha-gal in Maine likely caused by the bite of an &lt;em&gt;Ixodes scapularis&lt;/em&gt; tick, or deer tick. Though lone star ticks have rarely been found in Maine, they’re not thought to have established a local population in the area, according to the researchers. Despite this, they were able to find 23 confirmed cases of red meat allergy reported to the state dating back to 2014. While some people could have caught these cases while traveling in areas endemic to the lone star tick, several people reported no such travel.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The “findings might reflect a limited role for tick species other than &lt;em&gt;A. americanum&lt;/em&gt; in [alpha-gal syndrome] development in the United States, which is further supported through review of geographic distribution of suspected cases and range of &lt;em&gt;A. amblyomma&lt;/em&gt; ticks,” the authors wrote in one paper.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That said, most cases of red meat allergy in the U.S. are still reported in places where the lone star tick is found. Lab experiments have also supported the idea that these ticks are more likely to cause the allergy than other species in the U.S. But both &lt;em&gt;Ixodes&lt;/em&gt; ticks are widely distributed through regions of the U.S. and are already known to spread nasty diseases like Lyme to people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though alpha-gal cases caused by &lt;em&gt;Ixodes&lt;/em&gt; ticks might be rarer than the classic version, the overall incidence of the syndrome is climbing. A study in 2023 from the CDC and others &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/ticks-are-giving-americans-an-allergy-to-red-meat-1850687624"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that up to 450,000 Americans have developed alpha-gal syndrome since 2010, with rates likely increasing over that time period as well. So if more ticks besides the lone star can cause the condition, then people and doctors in parts of the country where it isn’t commonly found should at least be aware of the possibility, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Grip strength has long been used by doctors to identify patients at risk of developing various health problems early on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you can do this with the right weights, everything else is stronger,' he added&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The stronger and resilient body ages slower and has less disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To take the test, Mr Jones advises gripping a very heavy weight or object for one minute straight — for instance a dumbbell, that is three-quarters of your own body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the average British man, this means lifting 85kg, while for a woman it's 54kg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, lifting something this heavy can cause back injuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The maximum safe weight a man should lift is 25kg, while women should be careful lifting any more than 15kg, according to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hanging from a pull-up bar for as long as you can is another, less risky measure of grip strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For men, 60 seconds is a reasonable target; for women, 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Men who can hang for only 30 seconds, and women for only 15 seconds may have a raised risk of premature mortality, suggests research in the BMJ in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Grip strength has long been used by doctors to identify patients at risk of developing various health problems early on, including&lt;span&gt; cardiovascular disease and even dementia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2016, research involving nearly 7,000 people by University College London found that those who had weaker grip strength at the start of the 17-year study had a higher-than-average rate of premature death from all causes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Balancing on one leg continuously for more than 40 seconds is a key sign of strength and mobility among 18 to 39-year-olds, the health service says&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another analysis of previous research, with nearly 140,000 people, found that weak grip strength is a more accurate predictor for early death than high blood pressure, reported The Lancet in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And according to one study published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning last year, those with the least muscle strength were almost 150 per cent more likely to die early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you're unable to grip the weight for a full minute, Mr Jones advised working on building up strength in your hands and arms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are a number of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-7883199/How-strength-grip-provide-insight-overall-health.html"&gt;available gadgets &lt;/a&gt;that are designed to improve grip strength by strengthening the key muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts advise using some for just a minute a day to achieve a benefit.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another at home longevity exercise is the balance test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research suggests that those who can't balance on one leg for more than 10 seconds could be at a vastly increased risk of dying within 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And more recent studies claim that the length of balancing time should vary by age.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to NHS scientists, balancing on one leg continuously for more than 40 seconds is a key sign of strength and mobility among 18 to 39-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By contrast, those aged between 70 and 79 should manage 18 to 19 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The reason standing on one leg is such a marker of fitness is because it uses so many different parts of the brain and body at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It tests balance, and strength — and these two things are lost, the more frail a person comes, making them more prone to bone shattering falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the NHS test, those trying to test should aim to stand one one leg with their hands on their hips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Keeping their eyes open, the timer starts as soon as the foot lifts off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It stops when the foot is either lowered or their hands are taken off their hips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those aged 18 to 39 should manage 43 seconds, the NHS says, and 40 seconds if you're aged between 40 and 49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For 50 to 59-year-olds, the figure stands at 37 seconds and 30 for 60 to 69-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By 70 to 79, this drops to between 18 and 19 seconds and a little over five seconds if you're over 80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 15:40:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxNZzNXOXB2V1pBS0gxQTgxVUFSdXlWZ21OYTh2a1ZZTER0eEZ1Yjh6X1E4N3NVbzcxNkhNcWEzdTQySDg3dlFBakVETEQzaFQxVHF6V0tqQ1ZXQ0FMSTlNdWNLNVlxd0NuNS10c1U3V25LdGVsTjJDWlFORkR1dTU4OFZHSk9jMUd4SHVXeEVwWUo0bEpZRW1ZS3lLRHFQQzJ3OTdZdtIBqgFBVV95cUxPWXFsQUFtUjU2X2xLaEJyMFYtcUExZTZhSzdvazBhUUxYMDlUQlF0UHl5UWVEcFB4RlU4d2g2YTQ3WVZ4akJ6bFRyU0E0V3pHdEFYSXJJWkJLd1JxVFdKdjVFTXBQNGZFbDJwOWQta0VJNkZZakN1MWZ5bFZsc3Q5d2l5ZWp0eml4QVY2NE02SXN6QldFai02S0s2bTJZXzZTbEstR0JlX25wQQ</guid></item><item><title>Are you avoiding these ‘bad’ foods?

It travels through the bloodstream on lipoproteins, primarily low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein):&lt;/strong&gt; Often labeled as “bad” cholesterol, LDL can contribute to plaque buildup in the arteries if levels become too high.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein):&lt;/strong&gt; Known as “good” cholesterol, HDL helps remove excess cholesterol from the bloodstream, transporting it to the liver for excretion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG verticalImageClass"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2022/07/29/550x309/nuts_1659097298617_1659097316644_1659097316644.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Not all cholesterol is bad and the healthy one helps in removing the harmful cholesterol from our arteries(Pixabay)" title="Not all cholesterol is bad and the healthy one helps in removing the harmful cholesterol from our arteries(Pixabay)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Not all cholesterol is bad and the healthy one helps in removing the harmful cholesterol from our arteries(Pixabay)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Understanding that cholesterol has both beneficial and potentially harmful forms is essential. Rather than demonising all cholesterol, the focus should be on maintaining a healthy balance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Myth 2: Dietary cholesterol directly causes high blood cholesterol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact: &lt;/strong&gt;For many years, foods high in cholesterol—like eggs, shrimp, and red meat—were blamed for raising blood cholesterol levels. However, research over the past few decades has shown that dietary cholesterol impacts blood cholesterol to a much lesser extent than once believed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturated and Trans Fats:&lt;/strong&gt; These fats, rather than dietary cholesterol itself, play a more significant role in elevating LDL levels. Foods high in saturated fat (such as fatty cuts of meat and full-fat dairy) and trans fats (found in some processed foods) are more problematic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individual Response:&lt;/strong&gt; Genetics and overall diet quality also determine how dietary cholesterol affects blood levels. For most people, moderate consumption of cholesterol-rich foods does not lead to significant changes in blood cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth 3: All fats are unhealthy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact:&lt;/strong&gt; Not all fats contribute to heart disease. In fact, fats are essential for the absorption of vitamins and provide energy. The key is distinguishing between different types of fats:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unsaturated Fats:&lt;/strong&gt; Found in olive oil, avocados, nuts, and fish, these fats can improve blood cholesterol levels and reduce inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturated Fats:&lt;/strong&gt; While some saturated fat can be part of a balanced diet, excessive consumption has been linked to higher LDL levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trans Fats:&lt;/strong&gt; These are harmful fats often found in processed and fried foods and should be minimized as much as possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth 4: Cholesterol medications are harmful and should be avoided&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact:&lt;/strong&gt; Cholesterol-lowering medications, particularly statins, are among the most studied and effective tools for reducing the risk of heart disease. While all medications can have side effects, the benefits of statins in reducing heart attacks and strokes in high-risk individuals are well documented.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evidence-Based Use:&lt;/strong&gt; For people with high LDL levels or existing heart disease, statins and other lipid-lowering therapies can be lifesaving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individualised Treatment:&lt;/strong&gt; Not everyone needs medication. Decisions should be based on a comprehensive risk assessment that includes family history, lifestyle factors, and other health conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth 5: You only need to worry about cholesterol if you have heart disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact:&lt;/strong&gt; High cholesterol often develops without symptoms and can contribute to heart disease silently over many years. Regular screening is crucial, even if you feel healthy, as early detection and lifestyle changes can prevent complications down the line.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Screening Recommendations:&lt;/strong&gt; Most health guidelines suggest that adults get their cholesterol checked every 4-6 years, or more frequently if they have risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or a family history of heart disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventative Approach: &lt;/strong&gt;By knowing your numbers, you and your healthcare provider can develop a personalized plan that may include dietary adjustments, exercise and if necessary, medications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation around cholesterol and heart health is evolving as science uncovers more nuanced insights into how our bodies work. Dr Abhijit Borse said, “Debunking these common myths is not only about setting the record straight—it’s about empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their health.

In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;said on Friday&lt;/a&gt; that there have been 70 confirmed human cases since 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-2"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The virus is spread through contact with infected birds or other species, including through touching their droppings and bedding, although people can also catch the virus by killing or preparing infected poultry for cooking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Avian flu has been detected in cattle, in the United States, with the Centers for Disease Control reporting 41 cases and 989 dairy herds affected as of Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-3"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Other animals, including cats, foxes and pigs, have also been known to contract the virus, though the addition of sheep to that list will add to the concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Phil Stocker, chief executive of the National Sheep Association, which represents British sheep farmers, said that the case did not pose a threat to food safety but raised questions about farming different kinds of animals in the same location. “In this instance sheep and poultry have mixed on the same farm, resulting in the transmission of avian influenza,” he said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Meera Chand, emerging infection lead at the U.K.’s health security agency, said that while “globally, we continue to see that mammals can be infected with avian influenza,” the “current evidence suggests that the avian influenza viruses we’re seeing circulating around the world do not spread easily to people — and the risk of avian flu to the general public remains very low.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 15:18:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url=""

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Known as &lt;a href="https://www.neurosafeproof.com/home/background/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;NeuroSafe&lt;/a&gt;, the procedure involves checking prostate tissue removed from the patient while the operation is under way. If the examination suggests the tumour has been removed, the nerve-containing outer layer of the prostate can be left intact, reducing the patient’s risk of erectile problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Prof Greg Shaw, the trial lead and a consultant urologist at University College London hospitals NHS foundation trust, said: “This procedure gives surgeons feedback during the surgery to give them the certainty they need to spare as many nerves as possible and give men increased hope of recovering their sexual potency after their cancer is surgically removed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Prostate cancer is the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/28/prostate-cancer-becomes-most-common-cancer-diagnosis-in-england" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;most common form of cancer in men in England&lt;/a&gt;, with 50,000 cases diagnosed each year. Worldwide, nearly 1.5 million men are diagnosed and 375,000 die annually. The disease is most common in over-50s and is often called a silent killer because it causes no symptoms in the early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="0d76a7d4-b28c-4851-849c-741dd023209a" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":5,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Black men in England more likely to be diagnosed with late-stage prostate cancer, analysis shows","elementId":"0d76a7d4-b28c-4851-849c-741dd023209a","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/09/black-men-in-england-more-likely-to-be-diagnosed-with-late-stage-prostate-cancer-analysis-shows"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Recent developments in robotic surgery have allowed doctors to perform precision “nerve-sparing” operations in prostate cancer patients. This involves removing the diseased prostate while leaving the outer layers and the nerves running through them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;However, doctors must be sure that no cancer cells are left behind, and this can be difficult to assess. If the cancer is advanced, surgeons will err on the side of caution and remove the prostate with its outer layers to reduce the risk of missing any tumour cells and the disease returning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In the NeuroSafe procedure, doctors remove the prostate while preserving as much nerve tissue around it as possible. Slices of the prostate are then frozen, stained and examined for cancer cells. If the tumour reaches the surface of the prostate, the outer layers and its nerves may need to be removed. But if the tumour stops short, the surgery is considered complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The trial assessed 344 men with prostate cancer who had no history of erectile dysfunction. Half received the NeuroSafe procedure and half underwent standard surgery. A year later, 56% of men who had standard surgery reported severe erectile dysfunction, compared with 38% who had NeuroSafe surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Less than a quarter (23%) who had standard surgery reported no or only mild erectile dysfunction, compared with 39% who had the NeuroSafe procedure.

However, more research is needed to prove whether NeuroSafe is as effective as traditional techniques at delivering a complete cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We also need to understand exactly which men could benefit from this new technique and, crucially, whether this technique could be delivered at scale across the NHS to make it accessible to men across the UK.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 14:59:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQeXh6cFdSLUNSYk5hQ2xkSVp6T2l3Uno2ZkN2emhjT0FiNmtPaE5XZWdrYkh5b3JWb3VjWGFUbmc5UXhlblpVZWpOZG1QcUtva2VpSDYtR0ctTS1ISVU4WmtuaUJpRnNZeTIyZkJDNTl4QnAtZWowSFlucFgyZjJsZHE2LUZCWS1PQlpLbXVYbk4zZmtHWldZWUhYWnZ1ZHRH</guid></item><item><title>Doctor reveals what happens to your body when you don't eat enough fiber - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxNdDNvZmJmUHl3Ml9tWVZETHVSOFZfMEtyOV9ZQUxtbnJnNW9WSmRHSDZoOGpaRld1eGNydGRSbW4wY2xlM2lPYmdGWWNiTmE4MlJ3REhKZGlKSS1YNEZnN2h0LXZZelV0c0lzSXFTT0xtUDBpa1lKWWlVZ01UNGlrU0owLUNlanpUMnRtSWpXY0ZQVi1Nb3NDQnZCZ9IBoAFBVV95cUxOYVpSWjUyMjF2aFlrUWJfYnA3LVJBV2hUQ1FJRUZlOE5JX0Y4WkJIMFhqVGRiNWxIVnJoZzlMTksyMGN1VWpfS0NzU1JvMUV4MGpNdm5jVmtTdEZqYi1TcG0zTWlxa0pLVmhSNG0zN2FrSlJSNW1hb1VPVDFQQnZpZGk5NDNtd0lDMWtSdU13eVNWX3JTbE94VVcwNzU1MmNy?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

It was the kind of pain that takes your breath away. The bleeding was so severe that she went through a maxi pad every hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Two decades later, at age 38, she had another period that “felt like having your intestines grabbed and squeezed on the inside.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She called her gynecologist, and recalls that a nurse told her it was “just a bad period.” As the pain and abnormal bleeding raged on, she called again and was told to come in for an appointment the following week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I feel like this is where everything went downhill,” Adams, now 46, says. At her appointment, she found out she was having a miscarriage. She didn't know she was pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The miscarriage, she suspects, escalated the &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2024/08/19/what-helps-with-period-cramps/74639317007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;heavy and painful periods&lt;/a&gt; she had experienced since her first menstruation. When she expressed this to her doctor, it was dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But three years into a new relationship, &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2024/09/17/pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-shortage/74529722007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;she began bleeding after sex&lt;/a&gt;. Then, she bled all the time. She struggled to go to work, where she was a teacher for people with severe disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“The pain was so bad, I couldn't breathe, I was crying," she says. She was taking the maximum doses of Advil and Tylenol every day "and it didn’t even touch the pain,” she remembers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When her doctor retired, she found a new doctor who ordered tests to assess her abnormal uterine bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Adams was finally diagnosed in 2023 with adenomyosis, a gynecological condition once thought to impact only 1-5% of women, but recent estimates suggest it likely affects &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539868/#:~:text=Accurate%20demographics%20and%20disease%20prevalence,more%20insight%20about%20affected%20populations." data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;at least 1 in 5 women&lt;/a&gt;. Due to underdiagnosis, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539868/#:~:text=Accurate%20demographics%20and%20disease%20prevalence,more%20insight%20about%20affected%20populations." data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;the actual prevalence may be higher&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Adenomyosis is referred to as the "silent disease," as &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14167-adenomyosis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;many women experience mild or no symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, and it often goes undetected on ultrasounds. However, some women present with symptoms like Adams, but are misdiagnosed for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://innovativegyn.com/staff/natalya-danilyants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Dr. Natalya Danilyants&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified gynecologic surgeon and the director of &lt;a href="https://innovativegyn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;The Center for Innovative Gyn Care&lt;/a&gt;, says many OBGYNs and researchers are either unaware of the condition or fail to take it seriously. Adams had never heard of the condition before being diagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Common conditions in men and women, like cancer, diabetes or hypertension, get a lot of attention, but things like adenomyosis do not,” says Danilyants, who specializes in complex gynecological conditions. “Patients don’t know about it. The OBGYNs maybe know about it, but don't educate the patients. This leads to delay in care and underdiagnosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/21/USAT/82591403007-20240406-130530.jpg?crop=2544,3121,x0,y272&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;height=369&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/21/USAT/82591403007-20240406-130530.jpg?crop=2544,3121,x0,y272&amp;amp;width=600&amp;amp;height=738&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt='Kristina Adams says the doctor who diagnosed her with adenomyosis "saved her life."'&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption='Kristina Adams says the doctor who diagnosed her with adenomyosis "saved her life."' data-c-credit="Courtesy Of Kristina Adams"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;What is adenomyosis? Symptoms, causes explained&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Adenomyosis occurs when tissue from the lining of the uterus, called endometrial tissue, grows into the uterine wall. It can cause the uterus to double or triple in size, &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2022/04/18/period-flu-ill-nauseous-before-menstruation/7275020001/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;painful menstrual cramps&lt;/a&gt; (dysmenorrhea) and heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Other symptoms include irregular periods, pelvic pain, painful intercourse, bloating (nicknamed "adenomyosis belly") and infertility. The abnormal bleeding can increase a person’s risk of anemia and fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Adenomyosis has related symptoms but is distinct from &lt;a href="/story/entertainment/celebrities/2024/11/19/florence-pugh-endometriosis-pcos-egg-freezing/76429194007/#:~:text=Endometriosis%2C%20meanwhile%2C%20is%20a%20condition,Fertility%20problems%20also%20may%20develop.%22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;endometriosis&lt;/a&gt;, in which endometrial tissue grows outside of the uterus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;MRIs are more likely than ultrasounds to pick up adenomyosis, but insurance doesn't always approve them and it can cost patients thousands of dollars out-of-pocket. Danilyants says even when adenomyosis markers are found, doctors don't always take it seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Sometimes patients come in with a copy of their ultrasound or MRI, and on that report, there are findings suspicious of adenomyosis, and the patient didn’t even realize because the OBGYN never highlighted it as a significant finding,” Danilyants explains. “So there’s already the diagnosis, but still no one’s stressed that that’s the cause of the issue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The cause of adenomyosis is unknown, but Danilyants says risk factors include being in your 40s and having a history of multiple C-sections. Childbirth, prior uterine surgeries, such as a uterine fibroid removal or a dilation and curettage (D&amp;amp;C), and a history of endometriosis are also risk factors, according to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14167-adenomyosis#symptoms-and-causes" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Medication can help manage pain, but the only way to fully stop adenomyosis is a hysterectomy, a surgical procedure to remove the uterus. Most insurances cover a hysterectomy for adenomyosis if it is deemed medically necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Surgery is a big decision, but Danilyants says a vaginal or laparoscopy hysterectomy done by a specialist is a &lt;a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/conditions-services/obgyn/minimally-invasive-gynecologic-surgery/hysterectomy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;minimally invasive procedure&lt;/a&gt; that takes only 45 minutes under general anesthesia. Within 7 days, patients can return to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;She lost her job due to untreated adenomyosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;After Adams’ symptoms escalated, the school day she once looked forward to became increasingly challenging to get through. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Her doctor advised her to get a hysterectomy, and in 2024, she joked to her students that she was going away to get “old woman surgery.” But on the backend, she was pleading her case to human resources. She had run out of sick days. She couldn’t afford her bills and was living off credit cards. At the end of the school year, she left her job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Teaching gave me purpose, it was my identity,” she says. “Adenomyosis has gotten into all aspects of my life. My career, my relationships, my lifestyle.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/21/USAT/82590767007-kristina-adams-before-surgery.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/21/USAT/82590767007-kristina-adams-before-surgery.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;height=800&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Kristina Adams before her hysterectomy on October 27, 2024.

After switching from oral contraception to an &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2024/10/24/women-birth-control-iud-pain-cdc/75805591007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;intrauterine device&lt;/a&gt; (IUD) in 2016, she experienced an escalation of symptoms in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I started having really bad cramps all the time, even when I wasn't bleeding,” she recalls. “I would just get this sharp stabbing pain on my right side that would leave me just completely incapacitated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Doctors kept telling her to give her body a few months to adjust to the switch. For a year, Poffenroth pushed off asking them about her symptoms, even though she was leaving work early or waking up in the middle of the night, crying in pain, multiple times a month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;After finally receiving an ultrasound in 2018, the doctors said “everything was normal,” and didn’t discuss her results in depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Poffenroth decided to make a color-coded calendar for her doctor that showed how many days she was bleeding when she shouldn’t have been and rated her pain on a pain scale daily. After taking it to his office, she pleaded, “This is not normal. Please fix this.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Her IUD was removed that same day. She eventually switched to continuous birth control, which stops periods, but started bleeding through that. In October 2024, an ultrasound under a new doctor detected markers for adenomyosis. She had a thicker endometrial lining than the average person and was a candidate for a hysterectomy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“When (my doctor) walked into the room with the results, the first thing she said was, ‘Good news. It's not all in your head.’ I immediately started crying because I was so relieved,” Poffenroth says. “The worst part was when I wasn’t getting answers, because that’s when I felt the most invalidated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Her hysterectomy is set for June 12. She has a countdown on her phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I still feel like I've had it easier than a lot of people,” she says. “But I also think that is related to how women minimize their pain and suffering a lot of the time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Darlene Valencia wasn’t diagnosed with adenomyosis until after her surgery, despite suffering from painful and heavy periods for 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“The doctor recommended a hysterectomy. He never said why,” the 45-year-old says. At least three months passed before the procedure, and she was bleeding the whole time. When the report came back that she had adenomyosis, the doctor said, “I knew that’s what it was going to be all along.” She asked what it was and he gave her the "textbook definition," but left it at, “It’s gone now.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I felt really uncomfortable,” she says. “I feel fantastic now, (but) I kind of mourn my 30s, because I could have been feeling this way a long time ago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/21/USAT/82590768007-dee-photo.jpeg?width=660&amp;amp;height=660&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt="Darlene &amp;quot;Dee&amp;quot; Valencia didn't know she had adenomyosis until after her hysterectomy."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Darlene &amp;quot;Dee&amp;quot; Valencia didn't know she had adenomyosis until after her hysterectomy." data-c-credit="Courtesy Of Darlene Valencia"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Jennifer Fleming, 52, is an active mother of two who enjoys sailing and hiking. At 30, her ultrasound showed markers for adenomyosis, but she didn't want a hysterectomy — she was busy with her career, traveling and taking care of two young kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But in January 2023, she had a period that lasted for a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“The blood loss is crazy,” she says. “Tampons don’t even matter, because you’re gonna stick them in and you’re going to pull them out in 15 minutes. It’s scary when you’re looking at it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Her doctor dismissed her concerns. "He just chalked it up to being close to menopause,” she says. “There was no, ‘Hey, you don’t have to go through this.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She took a trip to the UC Davis Medical Center's emergency room in Sacramento, California. A uterine biopsy confirmed that she did not have cancer, but adenomyosis. She’s tried progesterone pills and an IUD to manage her symptoms, but the IUD isn’t working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I feel like crying, because I’ve been trying to hold out from major surgeries,” she says. “This bleeding situation sucks because I’ve stopped sailing because of it. I was trying to go on this 40-mile backpacking trip. I can’t do any of that right now.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/21/USAT/82590769007-jennifer-fleming-in-hospital.jpg?crop=3257,2362,x0,y0&amp;amp;width=660&amp;amp;height=479&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/21/USAT/82590769007-jennifer-fleming-in-hospital.jpg?crop=3257,2362,x0,y0&amp;amp;width=1320&amp;amp;height=958&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Jennifer Fleming believes going to the emergency room was why she was able to get the proper care from gynecological specialists at UC Davis Medical Center."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Jennifer Fleming believes going to the emergency room was why she was able to get the proper care from gynecological specialists at UC Davis Medical Center." data-c-credit="Courtesy Of Jennifer Fleming"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;'Hysterectomy is the gold standard'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The issue with adenomyosis care, Danilyants says, is that the doctors often treating patients are OBGYNs who “like to treat everything medically" by prescribing birth control and pain medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Birth control pills are not effective. It's treated by surgery,” she explains. “Hysterectomy is the gold standard for treating adenomyosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There is also an economic burden of untreated disease — chronic pain, infertility treatments and lost wages, Danilyants adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“This disease affects millions of women, and they're going to the ER getting blood transfusions. They're seeing a hematologist to get iron infusions,” she says. “So this is years and years of spending money to treat this condition that could have easily been treated with surgery. OBGYNs should be referring to specialists who can provide better treatment options.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Adams can’t help but wonder what her life would have been like if she had a different doctor or known about adenomyosis sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Periods shouldn't be that painful. This is real and you need to go to a doctor who will take you seriously,” she says. “I will never have a child now. I have my brother, but it's been a journey. I want women to believe in themselves, trust themselves, and seek a second opinion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s50"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s75"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>USA TODAY</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 14:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxQS3JEOUpsWjhCbzJIU2FDbjNEUERqa1RJYm45RVhoWm9Lc1ZyX1FNcElHSkNGVnVPaXUtd1B2RUwwQ2o4d2RnMDU4N0xsU3ROcjUwYmFlektCeWFtdVJsWWxSSU40UDZESDlzdnBrbUllSnVVMUhiOWpCV3NPYndTaEx1MG02bXpPZG1adi0zNzZnRUQwdEl5U3M4WldVc1I0YTZsVl9OVnNYMndZTUN6Y0E2M2dNU1QzYlFmcmhfaw</guid></item><item><title>There's an AI physio seeing patients in the UK.

Perhaps, something went awry while hoisting one of my young nephews in the air. Or, more likely, I messed my back up while lifting a bed so my wife could slide a rug underneath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Whatever the trigger, my overconfidence in my own strength left me with a lower back injury. Days later, the pain began radiating down the sciatic nerve in my left leg. Standing was fine, sitting was torture. In order to sleep, I had to slide a pillow underneath my legs to keep the downward-pulsing shockwaves at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;By mid-December, I saw a pain medicine specialist in the area of Washington, DC where I live. He ran some movement tests, sent me for X-rays, and wrote me a referral for physical therapy with a diagnosis of "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.uchealth.com/en/conditions/lumbar-radiculopathy" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;lumbar radiculopathy&lt;/a&gt;". In the United States, this is a relatively quick process – I went from pain to starting treatment in about three months. But that's still a very long time for something so common – and debilitating – as lower back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Since early January, I have seen human physical therapists who work wonders. Once a week, I go in, discuss my pain, get a soft-tissue massage, and do well-supervised exercises and stretches. My pain isn't gone, but it's finally under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;I specified that these physical therapists are human because, well, I've also been seeing a new physio in the UK. But my new British physio is only partly human. Rather, she's a series of pre-recorded videos made by a real physiotherapist, powered by artificial intelligence that I can access via an app on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Flok's promise is to start seeing patients immediately, relieve the burden on the NHS, and head off patients' back pain before they go untreated and deteriorate.

Anyone who has rowed before – or even spent time on a rowing machine at a gym – knows that the sport can be an incredible workout but also brutal on the back if your form isn't perfect. While a professional athlete, Stevenson had access to top doctors and physiotherapists who could treat his ailments immediately. But when he left rowing and his back pain flared up, he realised what it's like for everyone else trying to receive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It was quite a big shock in terms of what access to care looked like for 99.5% of people," says Stevenson, now Flok's chief executive. "In theory, I should be pretty well placed to manage this. I had an academic background, I'd had three years of professional physio.

They are looking to help people with the easiest and most manageable cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"There are quite a few conditions where that's true, where you don't need a scan, you don't need hands-on manipulation, you don't need medication," says da Silva. "What you need is 10 minutes of stretches a few times a week, and that will solve the problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The idea is that this should then free up clinicians to focus on the patients with more complex problems who really need their help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;This AI is more like a choose-your-own-adventure book where there are more than one billion intervention combinations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;When I first open Flok, I'm greeted by Kirsty, my physiotherapist. She appears in a minimalist setting with all of the accoutrements befitting a yoga instructor: black workout outfit, bamboo-coloured exercise mat, contemporary office chair, and a Monstera plant. She asks me questions about myself and my pain, and I respond by clicking multiple-choice options. Each response triggers a follow-up question or instruction as the underlying AI adapts to my answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But rather than being a live video call, this interaction is a series of pre-recorded video that are stitched together by AI based on my answers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;While the artificial intelligence boom of the past few years has been spurred by advances in generative AI from large language models, Flok has a different use for AI. "We essentially developed a domain specific language for describing clinical reasoning," says Stevenson. Because it's not a ChatGPT-like chatbot predicting the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/article/the-surprising-power-of-next-word-prediction-large-language-models-explained-part-1/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;next word in a sequence&lt;/a&gt;, there isn't a risk of the so-called &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-hallucinations" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;hallucination problem&lt;/a&gt; in AI where an &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67986611" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;algorithm makes things up&lt;/a&gt; – a major concern about &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.28.25323115v1" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;AI in the medical field&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Instead, this AI is more like a choose-your-own-adventure book where there are more than one billion "intervention combinations", says Stevenson. The power of AI makes it possible to deliver this in a seamless way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It's a "perfect software problem", says Stevenson. "Software is an extremely good delivery model if you know what you're trying to deliver, and if you just need to do that in a more scalable way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kzp59s.png.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kzp59s.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kzp59s.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kzp59s.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kzp59s.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kzp59s.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kzp59s.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kzp59s.png.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kzp59s.png.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kzp59s.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Estudio Santa Rita/BBC Lower back pain is one of the leading causes of disability around the world (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita/ BBC)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Estudio Santa Rita/BBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Lower back pain is one of the leading causes of disability around the world (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita/ BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Flok is currently expanding its operations. Its service launched first in Scotland at the end of last year and has recently signed contracts to add locations in England, though Stevenson isn't yet able to reveal where. In the next 12 months, Stevenson said he hopes to cover at least half of the UK. And they're also expanding what pain areas they're treating hip and knee osteoarthritis and women's pelvic health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But it is also not alone in trying to use AI to tackle musculoskeletal pain. Another AI-based app that helps patients manage pain in the lower back and neck called selfBACK has been undergoing &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://humanfactors.jmir.org/2024/1/e55716" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;clinical trials in the US&lt;/a&gt; as an add-on to more typical care services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Not entirely unlike Flok's approach, selfBACK works by analysing what treatments worked well for previous patients with similar conditions, then recommending personalised exercise plans. Studies have indicated that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2782459" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;it can help to reduce pain&lt;/a&gt; among those who use it. But a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://humanfactors.jmir.org/2024/1/e55716" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;recent trial&lt;/a&gt; found slow adoption rates – nearly one-third of trial participants never used the app, and another third only used it a few times. Patients and practitioners concluded that the app should be used to supplement traditional care rather than replace it. Other studies have also cautioned that self-management apps need to be provided in addition to care &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772628223000559" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;not as a replacement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Even so, research seems to suggest that mobile health apps of this nature are a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://mhealth.jmir.org/2024/1/e53262" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;potentially promising approach&lt;/a&gt; to helping patients manage their back pain. But there are also no shortage of questions about AI's integration into healthcare more broadly. Elizabeth A. Stuart, a professor and chair of the biostatistics department at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, says that AI healthcare tools should undergo the same rigorous evaluations as traditional medical interventions, such as regulatory approvals and peer review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"In some ways, these AI tools are no different from other healthcare interventions that we want to learn about the effects of," says Stuart. "We need to assess how well they work, do they work, who do they work for, just as carefully as we have done for other healthcare interventions." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Stuart says that while we don't need to reinvent the wheel when it comes to AI, we do need to recognise when these systems keep evolving even after they're deployed. "With some AI tools, they are sort of self-adapting," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She contrasts AI tools with the annual flu vaccines, which undergo deliberate assessment processes each year to ensure they're targeted to the latest viral strain. But sometimes AI tools are a black box, "changing under the hood" in real-time and it's not always clear how, she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Pranav Rajpurkar, an assistant professor of biomedical informatics at Harvard Medical School, says he sees promise in AI applications that help triage care for patients. "What's counterintuitive is that forced collaboration between AI and clinicians often underperforms compared to a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03456-y" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;clear division of labor&lt;/a&gt;," he says. "When doctors and AI review the same cases side-by-side, their &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-02850-w" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;combined accuracy&lt;/a&gt; is sometimes barely better than doctors alone. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-022-00506-6" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Clean separation of responsibilities&lt;/a&gt; side steps these issues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;Her pre-recorded videos don't watch my movements and stretches – they rely on me following her instructions correctly and reporting if something is amiss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In Flok's case, the company employs professional physios who appear in the videos that patients see, but are available to answer patient questions after their AI-enabled video sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Rajpurkar predicts that eventually "we'll move from narrow AI tools to generalist medical AI systems capable of handling multiple tasks across different domains". It's an approach he's working on with his own company, a2z Radiology AI, which is developing AI-powered analytics for radiologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The systems that succeed won't be those claiming to 'replace doctors', but those that thoughtfully redistribute clinical work to make healthcare more accessible, efficient, and human-centered," says Rajpurkar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In our first 20-minute session, Kirsty asks me a long list of questions about myself, about my pain, and asks me to stretch in different ways – following her careful lead on the screen – in order to decide the best course of treatment. She gives me stretches and exercises to try for the week ahead, with careful instruction not to push too hard or do anything that feels uncomfortable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This isn't the experience I have in-person with my team of human physical therapists in the US. They frequently correct my posture and tell me when I'm doing something wrong – which is often. The big difference here is that Kirsty can't see me. Her pre-recorded videos don't watch my movements and stretches. They rely on me following her instructions correctly and reporting if something is amiss. There's also an option at the end of the session to leave a voice note for a real physiotherapist who will respond to my personal needs or questions – a real voice behind the curtain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;My back felt better after my sessions with Flok, but the app likely isn't for me. I'm clumsy and uncoordinated and need someone watching my form at all times – if not, I'm likely to hurt myself further. That ability to watch patients and offer feedback on posture could be something AI will enable in the future – but until then, I'll be sticking with the humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="facebook" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="x" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b id="" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="instagram" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b id="." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxNeVFJRkFYVjdyOS1QN0w5RTk3UXhtZzVZMXlmOExZaXUyWUo5QmZVTnBlR2kyTFQyRUJ0N1RiRGFuclU3aHYzYk1kZHU0QVFSbEJBWmxQTXQ3SHBLczcxMG9ic3FSb0dVUF9FREhFeFozV1B4blpDY3RrV3ZvRjhuSnl1NHRIanFvWGo5OGxmM09jelpNZE4xTEJGdk9OOU9ESHZCMklNRGpZQThwYUVmS0VtOHpuanZmSm9neE9B</guid></item><item><title>11 Signs A Woman Is Emotionally Drained But Keeps Pushing Through - YourTango</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxNMW1Ia0lkc2R2OHkwRHE0eVRGYTgtelpnZkg5WlRsRUJKaG93aUc5SHBVdjVxZkZ6OGF1ME1TajUxNFdFLTNHTFNuR012MjBxOWdaanRQdVp6bFl0Wm5OYjFzenZUa2cxRUp3NVYtbXp0UUhvVzlTNHR3RFhvNHFCdVlGR1UybDcyRVE5SEJhTENkQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all go through times when we feel burned out and exhausted. It's just part of life. Sometimes we feel like we've lost our spark and need some help finding it again. While this can happen to anyone, it's especially troublesome for women, who are expected to handle everything at work and at home with perfect ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://berlincameron.com/research/2022/3/7/the-exhaustion-gap" rel="nofollow"&gt;A collaborative survey&lt;/a&gt; from Berlin Cameron, Eve Rodsky's "Fair Play," and Kantar, 68% of women in the U.S. felt burned out in the last week. On the other hand, only 50% of American men felt the same way. This 18% difference is telling, and is evidence of the signs a woman is emotionally drained but keeps pushing through. Women are struggling, but how do you know what to look for to know if this is the case?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here are 11 signs a woman is emotionally drained but keeps pushing through&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. She just doesn't care anymore&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-03/signs-woman-emotionally-drained-keeps-pushing-through-doesnt-care.png" alt="emotionally drained woman shrugging" title="signs a woman is emotionally drained but keeps pushing through she doesn't care anymore" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Cast Of Thousands | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If she just doesn't care about things like she used to, it's one of the sure signs a woman is emotionally drained but keeps pushing through. Not caring means she feels like giving up, but she still hasn't. Whether it's part of her professional or personal life, she has let go of the expectations she set for herself and the ambition she has and is simply coasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it may seem like it's not a huge deal, &lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/i-don-t-care-about-anything-why-you-might-feel-this-way-5215747"&gt;psychology educator Kendra Cherry&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that not caring can actually be a sign of something more serious. It could mean &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/behaviors-linked-hidden-depression"&gt;you are experiencing apathy&lt;/a&gt;, which means you feel indifferent, or that you are experiencing anhedonia, which means you can't feel pleasure. Both are signs of mental health conditions like depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some may feel perfectly happy, or at least okay, to continue pushing through while feeling like they don't care. However, this can be an indicator of a more worrisome condition that needs to be addressed with medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/love/good-husbands-support-stressed-exhausted-wives"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 Ways Good Husbands Support Their Stressed-Out, Exhausted Wives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2.

The human brain certainly allows for distraction pretty easily, and getting distracted is less challenging for some than it is for others. But if a woman is starting to seek distractions from everyday tasks she would normally complete without problems, it's not a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health writers &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-exhaustion"&gt;Adrienne Santos-Longhurst and Crystal Raypole&lt;/a&gt; explained that "mental exhaustion can happen when your brain receives too much stimulation or has to maintain an intense level of activity without rest." If you have too much to focus on at the moment, then distraction would certainly be tempting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone gets distracted from time to time, or &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/distraction-good-your-mental-health"&gt;wants to be distracted by something more interesting&lt;/a&gt; than whatever is necessary at that point in time. But actively seeking out these distractions repeatedly is a sign that a woman is really struggling. She can't deal with what's necessary, so she looks for alternative options for her attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/subtle-signs-woman-who-has-been-through-lot-life-according-research"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Subtle Signs Of A Woman Who Has Been Through A Lot In Life, According To Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="player-wrapper-outer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. She enjoys sleeping a bit too much&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-03/signs-woman-emotionally-drained-keeps-pushing-through-sleep-favorite-thing.png" alt="burnt out woman sleeping in" title="signs a woman is emotionally drained but keeps pushing through enjoys sleeping too much" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;PeopleImages.com - Yuri A | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a woman goes from being relatively active to wanting to sleep all the time, there's a problem. Most people would admit to enjoying their rest, but checking out so much that sleep becomes your favorite activity isn't normal at all. It's easy to assume that this is happening because of a lack of sleep, but it &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/signs-burned-out-according-psychologist"&gt;can really be a sign of burnout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.michiganmedicine.org/health-lab/sleep-deprivation-or-burnout" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sleep psychologist and wellness advocate Deidre Conry, PhD&lt;/a&gt; explained that feeling like you could fall asleep instantly is a &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/signs-sleep-deprived-not-tired"&gt;sign that you're not getting enough sleep&lt;/a&gt; or have a sleep disorder. On the other hand, if you're dealing with mental illness, nutritional problems, taking certain medications or pushing too hard or not hard enough with physical activity, you're likely dealing with the exhaustion that comes from burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is also a distraction in its own way. Unless you dream about your problems when you're asleep, you don't have to think about them. In that sense, it's definitely one of the signs a woman is emotionally drained but keeps pushing through, just wanting to escape the present moment and its worries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/subtle-signs-woman-who-never-had-struggle-day-her-life"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Subtle Signs Of A Woman Who Never Had To Struggle A Day In Her Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. She isn't as accurate as usual&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-03/signs-woman-emotionally-drained-keeps-pushing-through-not-accurate.png" alt="drained woman looking stressed out" title="signs a woman is emotionally drained but keeps pushing through isnt as accurate as usual" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;fizkes | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one is perfect, and making mistakes is simply part of being human. However, if a woman is emotionally drained, she'll likely make even more mistakes than the average person. As part of not caring anymore, she won't be careful. This will lead to a lack of accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/ss/slideshow-signs-youre-mentally-exhausted"&gt;mental health journalist Keri Wiginton&lt;/a&gt; put it, "It's impossible for your work to be perfect all the time. But mental fatigue lessens your ability to catch and fix your mistakes quickly or at all. That can cause serious problems in certain jobs, such as ones where you use machines, drive a vehicle or fly a plane."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone is &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/symptoms-of-emotional-exhaustion-mental-burnout"&gt;dealing with true mental and emotional exhaustion&lt;/a&gt;, they're naturally going to be less accurate and more prone to mistakes. They don't really have the mental capacity to be overly careful anymore. Unfortunately, this can lead to a vicious cycle, as they blame themselves for not doing a good enough job and then spiral further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/mistakes-make-someone-look-deeply-desperate"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 Mistakes That Make Someone Look Deeply Desperate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. She's become resentful&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-03/signs-woman-emotionally-drained-keeps-pushing-through-become-resentful.png" alt="woman feeling resentful toward man" title="signs a woman is emotionally drained but keeps pushing through shes become resentful" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;fizkes | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another sure sign that a woman is emotionally drained is that she has become increasingly resentful towards those around her. Even the ones she loves the most aren't immune to her apathetic and disgruntled attitude. She has become so unhappy with life that it's spreading to those around her like a contagion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-is-resentment" rel="nofollow"&gt;the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, "Resentment can be described as a complex, multilayered emotional reaction to being mistreated or wronged by another person, situation or series of circumstances." It is closely related to irritability, which &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/emotional-exhaustion-during-times-of-unrest" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jolene Hanson, LICSW&lt;/a&gt; listed as a symptom of emotional exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chances are, a woman is not really angry at those who are on the receiving end of her resentment. Rather, she's angry at life in general and how she feels about it. This can be tricky as it means feelings are bound to get hurt, and people whose support she needs may push her farther away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/behaviors-seem-rude-are-actually-signs-smart-woman"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Behaviors That Seem Rude But Are Actually Signs Of A Smart Woman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6.

Unfortunately, our emotional and physical health are closely linked and one can impact and change the other. So, if you're in emotional distress, you're bound to feel it physically as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hanson said that some of the physical symptoms of emotional exhaustion can include headaches, stomachaches, nausea and muscle aches. One's body undergoing this kind of tension can lead to longer-term problems like chronic stress and burnout, according to &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/emotional-exhaustion"&gt;research analyst Jacquelyn Cafasso&lt;/a&gt;. That's why it's important to take care of it as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/signs-youre-burned-out-not-lazy"&gt;being emotionally drained&lt;/a&gt; actually requires medical care. It's easy to put that care off because you think you're "just tired" or "just upset." But it runs so much deeper. When it starts to affect you physically, it can be especially dangerous, so it's best to consult with a professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/types-pain-direclty-linked-how-person-handles-emotions"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9 Types Of Pain That Are Directly Linked To How A Person Handles Their Emotions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7.

What makes that even worse is that anyone in a relationship can actually feel drained because of the relationship. Relationships themselves can be causes for burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Relationship burnout can occur when relationship stress becomes chronic, resulting in exhaustion, similar to other forms of burnout," &lt;a href="https://www.choosingtherapy.com/relationship-burnout/" rel="nofollow"&gt;licensed clinical social worker Michelle Risser&lt;/a&gt; said. "While burnout is often associated with work, it can also infiltrate relationships."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While relationship burnout is real, it's also possible that a woman might feel disinterest in romantic relationships because of being emotionally drained in other areas of her life, or just in general. Because of this, &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/heartbreak/early-signs-relationship-bad-news-according-psychology"&gt;relationship apathy can be difficult to pin down&lt;/a&gt; since there are multiple factors that can contribute to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/subtle-signs-woman-been-misunderstood-her-whole-life-according-research"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Subtle Signs Of A Woman Who Has Been Misunderstood Her Whole Life, According To Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8.

Someone could choose to turn to unhealthy coping mechanisms like drinking or smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cafasso urged people to not do this, saying, "Alcohol may temporarily boost your mood, but the feeling will quickly wear off, leaving you more anxious and depressed than before." Other forms of substance abuse are also not the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If she's using substances or doing similar things more often than she normally does, it's one of the glaring signs a woman is emotionally drained but keeps pushing through. She probably thinks that doing these things will help her push through and make life easier. Unfortunately, they only make it harder in the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/phrases-offend-emotionally-fragile-people-dont-bother-normal-thinkers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Phrases That Offend Emotionally Fragile People But Don't Bother Normal Thinkers At All&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9.

Even for people who love their jobs, there are still low days that feel awful. But the people who do value their job are typically able to bring at least a little bit of self-expression to the role. They make it uniquely their own amidst the monotony of a nine-to-five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if a woman is emotionally drained, that's no longer a priority for her anymore. Instead, she's simply focused on getting through each day, which is hard enough without adding an extra burst of creativity. Instead, her creative juices feel absolutely zapped out and she has nothing left to give.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323441" rel="nofollow"&gt;Counselor and psychotherapist Jayne Leonard&lt;/a&gt; specifically listed "working long hours" as something that can cause emotional exhaustion.

One of those things is how vigilant she is about her physical fitness. When you're dealing with emotional exhaustion, eating healthy and staying active really isn't a priority. It's all you can do to get out of bed and make it through each day, really.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/special-topic/break-the-bonds-of-emotional-eating" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mount Sinai&lt;/a&gt;, there is indeed a link between what you eat and how you feel. "Foods high in fat, sugar and salt can become more appealing when you are under stress, are in a bad mood or feel bad about yourself," they said. Much like alcohol, food can relieve stress, but only temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, it can be difficult to find the motivation to exercise when you don't really have the motivation for, well... anything. Cafasso pointed out that exercising will release endorphins and increase your serotonin levels, which will actually help with emotional exhaustion in the long run. Unfortunately, finding the will to power through and get it done is the hardest part of the battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/small-ways-take-better-care-yourself-nothing-do-diet-exercise"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Small Ways To Take Better Care Of Yourself That Have Nothing To Do With Diet And Exercise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;11.

We weren't meant to do life on our own. But for women who are emotionally drained, reaching out to others, even those closest to them, can just feel like too much. Slowly but surely, they will isolate themselves from family and friends who just want to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isolation or avoidance are both signs of emotional exhaustion, but this is the exact opposite of what you should be doing. According to Cafasso, "Talking face-to-face with a friend is a wonderful way to relieve stress." In situations where a friend is not readily available, she recommended looking into employee assistance programs that offered counseling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a woman who is emotionally drained, not reaching out to loved ones and &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/signs-someone-deeply-lonely"&gt;isolating herself will feel like the best thing to do&lt;/a&gt; because it's further avoidance of the problem. But really, the issue needs to be faced head-on.

ROACH: Our adult daughter was recently diagnosed with COVID psychosis. Evidently, it is so rare that many people, including medical personnel, have never heard of it. She is being held in a mental facility where she is in a manic state most of the time and very psychotic. She is finally taking her medicine, so she seems to be returning back to herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BODHXQGRWRC2JBVQSRI4HQIPGY"&gt;Do you have any information on this condition? Is it curable? Will she ever be able to return to her normal existence? They are wanting to release her, but we have yet to talk to any doctor or nurse who can just explain what the prognosis is. -- H.M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NMZONIGSUVA5BC5FJ7YCJC5PFY"&gt;ANSWER: Because so many people were diagnosed with COVID, there have been many reports of conditions that occurred after the infection. However, it can be hard to determine whether these happened by chance or whether they were due to the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RY3MOJWNYNAJVLEPFP66XBWTXY"&gt;Well-designed studies to determine whether the risk of an outcome is higher after an infection have been done for many conditions, and there are quite a few conditions that a person is clearly at a higher risk for after a bout of COVID-19. These are sometimes called “long COVID” symptoms. However, it isn’t completely clear whether psychosis is related to COVID, although I think it is likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XENJZCS2HBFM3JCIA4RYZBVFEA"&gt;Common symptoms of psychosis include hallucinations (often auditory); delusions (fixed, false beliefs); disorganized speech (often tangential to the point where it’s hard to keep track of what they are saying); and disorganized behavior, especially an inability to keep oneself properly dressed and cleaned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RAXOCEX7ZJBXHKOPGSUP3CL5KA"&gt;I did find a 2023 review of 57 cases of COVID psychosis, two-thirds of whom had never had any symptoms of psychiatric disease before their bout of COVID. (The authors noted that COVID isn’t unique, and other infections such as influenza also have an increased risk of psychosis.) The average range of people with a diagnosis of COVID psychosis was the 40s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3N63O5TRVRBENODJLAFCEYHDWA"&gt;COVID is known to affect many pathways in the brain through low oxygen levels, inflammation, and an enzyme called ACE2. It is reasonable to think that these changes could result in multiple psychiatric symptoms. As far as a prognosis, over 70% of the cases resulted in a complete recovery, but most people with this condition required antipsychotic drugs. (Though they were able to get off of the drugs.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRJI3BUMM5EXNB2XTTLEAU57NY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="R4Z5AASXJRBQBHR2KQGEMWQJNA"&gt;DEAR DR.

Can you comment on stevia’s impact on our microbiomes in your column? -- M.M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JVTLXJ3ASZHR7N7GPQ6RDRKNUM"&gt;ANSWER: I wish I could give you an answer that everyone would agree with, but the literature is conflicting. I found a well-done trial from 2024 showing that there were no significant changes in the microbiome (a term for the whole complex array of bacteria and other tiny life forms in our intestines) among volunteers taking five drops of stevia twice daily for 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PS5KNCAQLBAKXNZ3ESE4FZUAEA"&gt;Another study (from before the trial) showed increased diversity in a laboratory model, which is generally a good thing. Finally, a 2022 analysis of all trials found no evidence of harm to the microbiome. Based on this, I think it unlikely that stevia has a serious adverse effect on the microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EIWVWHWDMFATFGGNHLUHA4FLS4"&gt;Multiple studies have found that sugar has adverse effects on the microbiome, so if your main concerns are diabetes and your microbiome, the evidence at the present time supports stevia rather than sugar in your coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

Before that, the reflux was so bad it was going into my Eustachian tubes like a volcano and setting my ears on fire. I thought I was exploding. At that point, I was taking Prilosec twice a day with no relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MG6V2ZM7YBDCNEZ7E6YDIWPUPU"&gt;When my symptoms first began, I tried drinking water and not eating to avoid the horrible reflux. That didn’t work, so I turned to grape juice and was disappointed again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OAW3VR6FBFDDVILFWDWGUXNKSY"&gt;Dexilant saved me. My doctor said it would reduce the risk of Barrett’s esophagus turning into cancer. Recently the reflux has returned somewhat, and I would welcome any suggestions on managing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="76AUVM76ONBQBDVHOXDN6DWXK4"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A.&lt;/b&gt; Barrett’s esophagus is a condition in which the cells lining the swallowing tube (esophagus) change to more closely resemble cells in the intestines. There is an increased risk for esophageal cancer if these cells continue to be exposed to stomach acid splashing up into the esophagus. However, the increased risk is modest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HVHFVCBY65AZVFIMEGZDQQJDPI"&gt;Taking Prilosec (omeprazole) with grape juice is not ideal, because grape juice reduces the amount of omeprazole that can get into the bloodstream (Frontiers in Pharmacology, Dec. 4, 2024). The authors of this study warn that when people have conditions that require treatment with omeprazole, they should avoid drinking a glass of grape juice every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CV5MMLFJS5F7HDLPQ553KF4J3E"&gt;We do not know if grape juice might interact with Dexilant (dexlansoprazole). However, the intestines employ some of the same enzymes to metabolize these drugs, so we can’t rule that possibility out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" class="middleParagraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DF3DQP72CFDCVM3K4SJYNGEDC4"&gt;You will find many lifestyle measures for managing heartburn in our “eGuide to Overcoming Digestive Disorders.” This online resource is located under the Health eGuide tab at &lt;a href="https://www.PeoplesPharmacy.com" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.PeoplesPharmacy.com"&gt;www.PeoplesPharmacy.com.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:LNLEL3DNLBDJ5CKZZJJ6WNDNUU" data-fusion-component="LNLEL3DNLBDJ5CKZZJJ6WNDNUU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:LNLEL3DNLBDJ5CKZZJJ6WNDNUU" data-fusion-component="LNLEL3DNLBDJ5CKZZJJ6WNDNUU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XGURVYUN6VAFLJBTB2HBSBKTVM"&gt;* * * &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DHWHNI32IRFSBHG3FVQIYBB2PQ"&gt;In their column, Joe and Teresa Graedon answer letters from readers.

I’m an oncologist and a cancer epidemiologist, which means I investigate patterns and causes of cancers. As &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/12/alcohol-consumption-industry/" target="_blank"&gt;more Americans drink less&lt;/a&gt;, one question that has come up is whether casual drinking, or drinking alcohol infrequently, increases cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HBHN2SYTVNGSNPHETMMSPUJSSM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The answer is “probably,” though at a very low level. Cancer risk is not binary: Having one drink, or smoking one cigarette, will not cause cancer. In general, the more you’re exposed to a risk factor, the higher your likelihood of developing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SXKR6HA7ZZFGTH7T5KK2XMFAKM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The data have &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-84181-1" target="_blank"&gt;clearly shown&lt;/a&gt; that your risk for cancer increases the more you drink, and the best way to eliminate your risk of alcohol-related cancers is to stop drinking. Personally, I keep my alcohol intake to no more than one or two drinks per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VH6X4TJJJZBNHMA4KF7CISI2JA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In January, when the surgeon general released an &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/reports-and-publications/alcohol-cancer/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;advisory about alcohol and cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;, some people I know eliminated or reduced their own alcohol intake, while others scrutinized the data on which the advisory was based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5RUJSBZUDJH4PGESBZ46V22YD4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To help you make your own decisions about alcohol, I &lt;a href="https://www.cebm.ox.ac.uk/resources/ebm-tools/critical-appraisal-tools" target="_blank"&gt;critically appraised&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;the&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;scientific research on alcohol and cancer risk — which&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;sounds negative but is actually a formal, systematic approach to evaluate the quality of scientific research. Here are three key takeaways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WMR4IH65FRCNXNJKGYMGOV4QYY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Several cancers — but not all of them — have been linked to drinking.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KYUM7NIHQZF43OOCYQRQ5OGUBM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Alcohol consumption has been linked to cancers of the oral cavity, throat, voice box, esophagus, breast, colon and rectum, and liver. In the report, the surgeon general said that the risk for certain cancers may start to increase with one or fewer drinks per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MRHETKAG75CVDGE6XMLTGCVCCQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/45/3/916/2572556" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that is cited in the advisory asked whether alcohol consumption increases risk of two types of breast cancer. The answer is “yes” to both — with a 35 percent increased risk for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer and a 28 percent increased risk for estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XWI7CZTQQFBDHAWF7P67476NF4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But it is much less clear whether increased alcohol intake is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24986108/" target="_blank"&gt;associated&lt;/a&gt; with some other cancers, such as leukemia. So, when a patient asks me whether alcohol consumption causes cancer, the answer must go beyond “yes” or “no.” For some cancers, the answer is “no” or “we don’t think so,” but for others, the research clearly indicates the answer is “yes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZN5AYRWXZNHZDBYJNI7H3JV55U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Researchers can’t tell people to start drinking for the sake of science.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ERDF6HOTNBEINPXXONY2T7GZXQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The “&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)60742-5/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;gold standard&lt;/a&gt;” for study designs are randomized controlled trials, in which some people are randomly assigned to one intervention, others to another intervention, and then outcomes between the two groups are compared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="46KQHSNJM5AW5B5MR5RW5XUMKE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For most epidemiological research, this ideal study design is impossible and may be unethical. For example, in the study looking at alcohol and breast cancer risk, over 26,000 women with breast cancer were included from a variety of other studies looking at diet and health outcomes, in which alcohol intake was assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EH5IDMC52JGNPMLAINCQKWUIU4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It would have been unethical to design a study in which women were randomized to drink a lot of alcohol or none at all, to then determine who developed breast cancer, and it would take decades to answer the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ECL5U2CQEJFOBJCLWDMFVGNQPY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So for this type of epidemiological question, a so-called &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/cohort-study" target="_blank"&gt;cohort study&lt;/a&gt;, in which a group of people with a common characteristic (women who drink alcohol) is followed over time for a particular outcome (breast cancer), is the best path forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LEKR7JNOQBD37CJCDNOOMZ7LRY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multiple studies have reached the same conclusion.

And when it comes to alcohol, what we do know — after multiple studies in hundreds of thousands of people reaching the same conclusion — is that alcohol is a risk factor for certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FCWYOVPJ6ZHX5J76PZYAWWOY7U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But that doesn’t mean the data are perfect. One&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4453639/" target="_blank"&gt; study&lt;/a&gt; cited in the surgeon general’s advisory included over 485,000 cancer cases from more than 500 other studies looking at several cancer types. If you take a closer look at the included studies, some information was collected in real time, but some was retrospective, which may be prone to errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SSTZDFYAERGDLGVA44WPK7PQAU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Imagine if you had cancer and someone asked you, on average over your entire life, how much alcohol you drank each week. How accurate would your estimate be? Some might undercount their intake, while others might overcount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UMQM2H7P7VCURLENJGR4ERLNSY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Now let’s explore how the amount of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/standard-drink-sizes/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;drinking was defined&lt;/a&gt;. Light drinking was approximately one glass of beer, wine, or alcohol per day or less; moderate was less than four drinks daily; and heavy was more than four drinks daily. For some cancers, such as esophageal and breast, the cancer risk was higher for light, moderate and heavy drinkers, compared to nondrinkers. But for others, such as colorectal, the risk was higher only for moderate and heavy drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TPF5Z2YTTFB6JKFR2IID3LNAGY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some of the included studies defined light, moderate and heavy drinking differently, so the investigators sometimes had to average alcohol intake reported in those studies to include them in their analyses. Additionally, there was no distinction between types of alcohol intake and cancer risks, leaving open the question of whether cancer risk is similar for people who drink wine and those who drink hard liquor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="76HVKLRXJNBQ7J5E5ZJB2OGJUY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Finally, let’s consider the scene. Do people tend to enjoy a glass of wine before dinner? Or do they drink beer at a bar while consuming a cheeseburger with fries? Or maybe smoke a pack of cigarettes with their whiskey? If it’s one of the latter two scenarios, the food and the smoking may contribute to cancer as much or more than the alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JETLGYJH3JDCDCAD2WSYFHNJNU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Even taking into consideration all of these factors affecting study quality, the totality of the data point to alcohol causing cancer. Less alcohol is better, and each of us must determine our own tolerance for cancer risk when deciding how much alcohol to drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CDUNFBICXBFB7CFM33CCURKZGY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mikkael A.

Another 25% have between 11 and 50 employees, and just 10% have grown to more than 50.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="31c6u-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="31c6u-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="31c6u-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;To make the mental health tech landscape easier to understand, the team divided the sector into four categories: self-care, managed care platforms, workflow automation and mental health research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="61vvb-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="61vvb-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="61vvb-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Self-care refers to tools that help individuals manage their mental well-being. These include biofeedback devices, peer-support apps and AI-guided therapy platforms that offer structure and coping tools.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="cdddo-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="cdddo-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cdddo-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;One example is Dugri, a digital platform that provides structured, anonymous peer support. It’s been widely used in Israel, especially among soldiers and their families, to help process trauma through guided conversations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="bbntp-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="bbntp-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="bbntp-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“By placing support directly in the hands of users, these technologies offer accessible, stigma-free and immediate relief,” the report noted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="dca1v-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="dca1v-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="dca1v-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Managed care platforms connect patients and therapists through digital or hybrid models. These might include telehealth services or AI-powered tools to assist in treatment delivery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="4fjin-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="ds93s-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="ds93s-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="ds93s-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;In this space, Kai.ai stands out. It’s an AI-based mental health platform rooted in cognitive behavioral therapy and positive psychology. The company works with Israeli universities to support thousands of reservists. Another company, GrayMatters Health, uses brain-computer interface tech to help people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) regulate brain activity by targeting biomarkers linked to the amygdala.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="c08dq-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="c08dq-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="c08dq-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Workflow automation tools aim to ease clinicians’ administrative load, allowing them to focus more on therapy and less on paperwork. This is especially important in Israel, where the mental health system has long been underfunded. According to the Health Ministry, there is only one public-sector psychiatrist for every 11,705 people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="b3fj-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="b3fj-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="b3fj-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“Automation tools help streamline services, reducing wait times and allowing clinicians to focus on treatment rather than administration,” the report explained. “AI-driven automation solutions also ensure that individuals in crisis receive timely interventions, making the system more efficient and effective.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="3t8if-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="3t8if-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="3t8if-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;One company leading this area is Eleos Health. Its AI platform automatically captures key moments in therapy sessions and generates clinical documentation, streamlining workflows and helping therapists reduce symptoms faster. Eleos is among the most advanced mental health startups in Israel. According to Startup Nation Central, it has raised $128 million to date, including $60 million in a Series C round in January 2025.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="3d7a0-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="3d7a0-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="3d7a0-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Mental health research is the final category. This field focuses on early diagnosis, personalized psychiatry and machine learning tools that improve diagnosis accuracy, predict patient response to treatment and tailor care to the individual.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="72e6q-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="72e6q-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="72e6q-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;One company in this space is NeuroKaire, which uses patients’ blood cells to create brain models. These lab-grown neurons allow medications to be tested outside the body, offering a faster, more precise way to treat PTSD, depression and anxiety.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="bp93t-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="bp93t-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="bp93t-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Tolub said the idea for iCAR—Israel Collective Action for Resilience—came after the war when it became clear that trauma care in Israel was fragmented. Even patients struggling to find help didn’t know where to turn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="59gbm-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="8ft5j-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="8ft5j-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="8ft5j-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Beyond that, Israel still lacks national protocols for mental health or trauma healing. And today, with nearly 10 million people affected by some form of trauma simply by living through October 7 and the ongoing seven-front war, iCAR saw an urgent need to accelerate recovery efforts. Tolub said the organization is helping connect NGOs, universities, philanthropists and other players to move things forward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="d52gg-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="d52gg-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="d52gg-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“We built a scientific advisory board with various experts from universities, health funds, etc., and we asked them if they had $100 million where they would put it—and then identified eight areas that could disproportionately accelerate healing from October 7,” Tolub said. “We identified interventions with high societal returns on investment.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="67bsc-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="67bsc-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="67bsc-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;One of those areas is advancing technological initiatives in mental health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="43hc3-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="43hc3-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="43hc3-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Startup Nation Central echoed that vision, saying there is “significant expansion potential for Israel’s mental health ecosystem—particularly in trauma care and resilience-building for broader communities.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="4beun-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="4beun-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="4beun-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The report stated: “Israel’s mental health crisis calls for coordinated, immediate action to leverage technological innovation in this sector. Several pivotal steps are required to grow the field and harness existing knowledge and innovation: firstly, expanding digital treatment options by integrating AI and automation solutions into legislation and national health policy; concurrently, intensifying public information campaigns and trauma awareness through digital psychoeducational programs and community initiatives; focusing on early detection of mental health trends through data analytics to prevent crises from escalating; increasing investment in both established and emerging startups to support research, development and widespread adoption of existing solutions; and finally, promoting international collaborations, drawing on Israel’s expertise in trauma care to assist global communities grappling with wars, disasters and mass-casualty events.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="29iq-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="29iq-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="29iq-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Tolub stressed, “We do not have a choice.

Mellor, in a shirt that shouts “VIOLENCE MIGHT BE THE ANSWER”, is a self-professed attendee of the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“And that lazy part just makes them ignorant … Covid has proven that obviously this is true. I mean, all the facts are starting to come out on Covid now – that it was a hoax. That is just an extension of where this hoax began decades earlier with the vaccines, OK? This is all a money grab, this is all a power grab.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;This is not an isolated, rural, religious community.

Where he once opposed only the Covid-19 shots, he now opposes vaccines entirely – arguing they harm children despite experts on vaccines considering them one of mankind’s greatest medical achievements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“This is not an isolated, rural, religious community, which I think is what a lot of people associate with an anti-vaccine mentality,” said Kathryn Olivarius, author of Necropolis: Disease, Power, and Capitalism in the Cotton Kingdom, and historian of disease at Stanford University. “This is in the heart of everything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Sarasota has become a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/power/interactive/2023/sarasota-maga-dream/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;proving ground&lt;/a&gt; for the Maga right. Among nail salons, mom-and-pop Cuban restaurants and roadside motels lining US 41, known locally as the Tamiami Trail, a visitor can find the gates of New College. This was once a public university prized for its progressive liberal arts education. Now it is part of the new conservative experiment in remaking higher education led by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/11/new-college-of-florida-rightwing-takeover" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;activists&lt;/a&gt; aligned with Donald Trump and the Republican Florida governor, Ron DeSantis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Along the same road is the Sarasota memorial hospital, an aberration in American healthcare – it is publicly owned with open board elections. The normally sleepy election became contentious when insurgent &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/21/1144798353/in-florida-health-freedom-activists-exert-influence-over-a-major-hospital" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;“health freedom”&lt;/a&gt; candidates, supported in part by Mellor, entered the race. Three &lt;a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/08/23/sarasota-election-sarasota-county-hospital-board-health-freedom/10291181002/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;won seats&lt;/a&gt; on the nine-member board in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Even the name of this stretch of sun-bleached asphalt is up for debate. This year, a state Republican lawmaker – who has also &lt;a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/222" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;introduced bills&lt;/a&gt; to limit vaccine requirements – briefly proposed changing its name to the&lt;a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/25/bill-would-rename-us-41-road-tamiami-trail-to-gulf-of-america-trail/80264969007/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; “Gulf of America Trail”&lt;/a&gt; – a nod to Trump’s renaming of the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Arguably the most salient artifact of this activism in Sarasota is the least visible: vaccination rates against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Measles vaccination rates for kindergarteners have plummeted over the last two decades – from 97% in 2004 to 84% in 2023, according to state health records. Sarasota is roughly on par with the vaccination rates in rural Gaines county, Texas – the center of the ongoing measles outbreak that sickened 279 people in &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;in that state alone&lt;/a&gt;. Notably, both Gaines county and &lt;a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/local/2023/12/25/why-do-these-sarasota-manatee-parents-choose-to-homeschool-their-kids/71976358007/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Sarasota&lt;/a&gt; have large home-schooling communities, meaning vaccination rates could in fact be lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;These are diseases that have killed hundreds of millions of people – and quite horribly too&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;It is well known in research circles that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/trump-adminstration-health-policy" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;right-leaning states&lt;/a&gt; across the US south and west have worse health metrics – from obesity to violence to diseases such as diabetes. That reality was supercharged during the pandemic; as vaccine mandates became a fixation on the right, Republican-leaning voters became more skeptical of vaccines. In turn, places with politically conservative leaders &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/political-ideology-of-u-s-elected-officials-linked-with-covid-19-health-outcomes/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;experienced more Covid-19 deaths&lt;/a&gt; and greater stress on hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to medicine. At least 95% of the population needs to be vaccinated to prevent outbreaks of the disease. But despite a supremely effective vaccine that eliminated the disease from the US in 2000, vaccine hesitancy has increasingly taken hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-19" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-rsfwa"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;This Week in Trumpland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"the-stakes-us-election-edition","successDescription":"A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The measles vaccine in particular has been subject to a sustained &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/13/majority-antivaxx-vaccine-ads-facebook-funded-by-two-organizations-study" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;firehose of misinformation&lt;/a&gt; stemming from a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2011/jan/12/andrew-wakefield-fraud-mmr-autism" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;fraudulent paper&lt;/a&gt; linking the vaccine to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/07/cdc-study-vaccines-autism" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;autism in 1999&lt;/a&gt;. For years, this misinformation was largely nonpartisan. And Florida’s anti-vaccine movement was active even before the pandemic – with a vocal contingent of parents arguing against strengthening school vaccine standards &lt;a href="https://www.gainesville.com/story/news/state/2019/10/13/anti-vaccine-movement-derails-bill/2544195007/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;What appears new in Sarasota is how local conservative activists have brought opposition to vaccines into the heart of their philosophy. By Mellor’s telling, he and a loosely affiliated group of Maga activists began to adopt anti-vaccine beliefs as the pandemic wore on – helping organize major health protests in the area in recent years, such as mask mandate opt-outs and the “health freedom” campaign for hospital board seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Mellor said his nearby property, the Hollow, was a&lt;a href="https://www.thehollow2a.com/event-details/sarasota-memorial-hospital-board-meeting-2" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; gathering place&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic (it is also a part-time gun range). He cites ivermectin, an &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/ivermectin-and-covid-19" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;anti-parasitic drug&lt;/a&gt; that became a fascination of the right, as the reason “we didn’t lose people at all” during the height of the pandemic. Available clinical evidence shows it is not effective against Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Kennedy has fit neatly into this realignment. He enjoys trust ratings among Republicans nearly as high as Trump, according to polling from the health-focused &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-and-trust/press-release/poll-trust-in-public-health-agencies-and-vaccines-falls-amid-republican-skepticism/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Kaiser Family Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. Kennedy has already spread dubious information about measles vaccines in public statements (notably: from a&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/12/rfk-jr-hannity-interview-beef-tallow" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; Steak ’n Shake&lt;/a&gt; in Florida) – a response one vaccine expert said “couldn’t be worse”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“While children are in the hospital suffering severe measles pneumonia, struggling to breathe, [Kennedy] stands up in front of the American public and says measles vaccines kill people every year and that it causes blindness and deafness,” said Dr Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the division of infectious diseases at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Severe side effects from the vaccine are possible, but they are much rarer than disability and death from measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“This is what happens when you have a virulent anti-vaccine activist, a science denialist, as the head of the most important public health agency in the United States,” said Offit. “He should either be quiet or stand down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The same poll found trust in public health agencies has fallen precipitously amid Republican attacks. More than a quarter of Republican parents report delaying childhood vaccines, the poll found, a rate that has more than doubled since 2022. There is no analogous trend among Democratic parents. Despite how claims espoused by vaccine skeptics can be easily refuted, their power has not been undercut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The anti-vaccine business is &lt;a href="https://counterhate.com/topic/anti-vaxx-misinformation/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;big business&lt;/a&gt;,” said Offit, pointing to the myriad unproven “treatments” offered by promoters of vaccine misinformation, some of which are offered at Mellor’s We the People health center. “We have been taken over by a foreign country, and the goal of that foreign country is to disassemble public health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The misery of measles did not take long to appear in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; – measles-induced pneumonia has already led pediatricians to intubate children, including at least one baby, according to the Associated Press. About one to three people out of 1,000 who are infected by measles die from the infection, and one in 1,000 suffer severe brain swelling called encephalitis, which can lead to blindness, deafness and developmental delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We actually don’t have the perspective people in the past had on these diseases,” Olivarius. “I have spent many, many, many years reading letters and missives from parents who are petrified of what’s going to happen to their children” if there are outbreaks of yellow fever, polio or measles, Olivarius said about diseases now largely confined to history – thanks to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The lesson from history is these are not mild ailments,” she said. “These are diseases that have killed hundreds of millions of people – and quite horribly too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian US</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 10:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOblE4US1DS0pOZkswWW5TdURPY2l4LTRaSFRxVlNsODloazZYUnRyOG9tZldWTlRyeU9QV2NqdHBhS3JaZTVRa2R4S2thODl2Q2pKdGx0QnVzaWx1V3labi1iOTMxZ2JBcURKSS14MW5wSlAyVlFqSlkzVVJVNFZLZlpUQWxqaF9iS1Y4dkpha3RhOHJt</guid></item><item><title>How often should you wash your feet? - BBC.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxQazFQajFYcmxJaWhwUV9aaUh3YXc4VjRSYmhRMllXXzU3cTJUWFozUk9QaUNzV0NRcW5Nd1drczR4RElUMzBvbzYweE51bGt5WWIzNW9lVkRETV9UOFF0aXh6TEItV2pmVm9FbkFnME5qVFZOQ1J6WVRfMEkzMW8zcmx3NkZCdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 itISwu"&gt;Your feet are home to billions of bacteria.

The underarm region no doubt gets the full lather, rinse, repeat treatment. Your feet, by virtue of being located at the end of your body, can be easy to overlook. However, according to some experts, your feet are just as, if not more, deserving of attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Both the UK's National Health Service (&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/smelly-feet/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;) and US &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/hygiene/about/foot-hygiene.html" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Centre for Disease Control (CDC)&lt;/a&gt;, for example, advise washing feet daily with soap and water. One reason for this meticulous care is to prevent odour. The soles of the foot contain &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20150730-the-disgusting-secrets-of-smelly-feet." class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;600 sweat glands&lt;/a&gt; per square centimetre of skin, more than any other region of the body.  Although sweat itself doesn't smell, it contains a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23328940.2019.1632145#d1e150" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;nutritious broth&lt;/a&gt; of salts, glucose, vitamins and amino acids, which serves as an &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/spectrum.04180-22" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;all-you-can-eat buffet&lt;/a&gt; for bacteria that live there. And there a lot of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The foot – especially between the toes – is quite a moist, humid, and warm environment, so it can be a breeding ground for microbes," says Holly Wilkinson, a lecturer in wound healing at the University of Hull in the UK. This is exacerbated by the fact that most people encase their feet in socks and shoes, trapping the moisture inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;If you zoom in on any square centimetre of human skin you will find between 10,000 to one million bacteria &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2493393/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;living there.&lt;/a&gt; Warm and moist areas of the skin, such as the feet, are considered prime real estate and are home to the greatest numbers of species. Feet are idyllic havens for &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19478181/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;i id="corynebacterium" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Corynebacterium&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i id="staphylococcus" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Staphylococcus&lt;/i&gt; bacteria&lt;i id="," class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for example.

In fact, the human foot contains &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12171" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;a greater biodiversity of fungal species&lt;/a&gt; than any other body region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This is probably a good reason to clean your feet. In one study, researchers &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/18/3503" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;swabbed the soles&lt;/a&gt; of 40 volunteers. They found that foot washing had a significant impact on bacteria numbers. People who washed their feet twice a day had around 8,800 bacteria living in each square centimetre of skin. Those who reported washing every other day had over one million bacteria per square centimetre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However just because the soles of your feet are brimming with microbial life, that doesn't mean that they are necessarily smelly or that there is anything to worry about. As always, it's not just the number, but the type of bacteria that's important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;The human foot contains a greater biodiversity of fungal species than any other body region&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;i id="staphylococcus" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Staphylococcus&lt;/i&gt; are the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark-Harker/publication/271213529_Spatial_variations_in_the_microbial_community_structure_and_diversity_of_the_human_foot_is_associated_with_the_production_of_odorous_volatiles/links/5657182e08aeafc2aac0bad5/Spatial-variations-in-the-microbial-community-structure-and-diversity-of-the-human-foot-is-associated-with-the-production-of-odorous-volatiles.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;key players&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to producing the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) responsible for foot odour. Sweat glands on the skin of the feet release a heady mix of electrolytes, amino acids, urea and lactic acid. The &lt;i id="staphylococcus" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Staphylococcus &lt;/i&gt;bacteria consider this a veritable feast and, in the process of feeding, convert amino acids into VFAs. The main chemical culprit is isovaleric acid, which has an unpleasant odour which has been described as having a "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ffj.3136" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;distinct cheesy/acidic note"&lt;/a&gt;. The comparison is apt, as many cheeses contain a similar &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030218302984" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;mix of volatile chemicals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In one &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark-Harker/publication/271213529_Spatial_variations_in_the_microbial_community_structure_and_diversity_of_the_human_foot_is_associated_with_the_production_of_odorous_volatiles/links/5657182e08aeafc2aac0bad5/Spatial-variations-in-the-microbial-community-structure-and-diversity-of-the-human-foot-is-associated-with-the-production-of-odorous-volatiles.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;2014 study,&lt;/a&gt; researchers swabbed the feet of 16 subjects and found that 98.6% of the bacteria present on the soles of the feet were &lt;i id="staphylococci" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Staphylococci&lt;/i&gt;. The levels of VFAs, including the key foot odour compound isovaleric acid, were also significantly increased on the sole of the foot compared to the bridge (top) of the foot. Overall, the study concluded that the intensity of foot malodour was correlated to the total number of &lt;i id="staphylococcus" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Staphylococcus&lt;/i&gt; present – another reason to reach for the soap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, washing your feet isn't just about preventing cheesy foot odour. Many diseases and foot problems can be prevented through good foot hygiene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Because of the small space between the toes, these areas are particularly at risk for microbial infections," says Joshua Zeichner, associate professor of dermatology at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. "This can lead to itching, swelling, and a foul smell. As the skin barrier becomes disrupted, this can also increase the risk of microorganisms invading the skin and causing more significant soft tissue infections known as cellulitis," he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;According to Zeichner, the most common problem is the development of athlete's foot, which is a superficial fungal infection of the skin on the feet. The fungi that cause athlete's foot&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/for-patients-and-visitors/patient-information/conditions-treated-a-to-z/athletes-foot" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt; thrive in warm, dark, and moist environments&lt;/a&gt; – hence why this condition most commonly affects the spaces in-between the toes. Keep this area clean and dry and you deprive the fungi of their perfect home. This is a good thing, as athlete's foot can cause a series of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/athletes-foot/symptoms-causes/syc-20353841" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;unpleasant symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as itchiness, a scaly rash, flaky skin and cracking on the soles of your feet and between your toes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Gorka Olmo/BBC Our feet are home to a surprisingly diverse array of fungi that make their home in the many microscopic folds and creases of these appendages (Credit: Gorka Olmo/ BBC)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Gorka Olmo/BBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Our feet are home to a surprisingly diverse array of fungi that make their home in the many microscopic folds and creases of these appendages (Credit: Gorka Olmo/ BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Keeping your feet clean could also prevent skin infections, such as those caused by &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1586/14787210.2015.1023291" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;i id="staphylococcus" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Staphylococcus&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i id="pseudomonas" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt; bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. While these bacteria exist naturally on your skin, if they get into your bloodstream via a cut then it can lead to a serious infection. Even a minor staph infection can lead to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/staph-infections/symptoms-causes/syc-20356221" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;boils&lt;/a&gt; – bumps of pus that form under the skin around hair follicles or oil glands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The feet are more prone to infections because there's quite a lot of biomass of bacteria there, and also if you do have cracks or injuries to your feet, it tends to heal much more slowly than other areas of the body," says Wilkinson. "In a situation like that, there's a greater chance that if you have an injury, pathogens could get into that wound, populate and overgrow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;While skin infections can still occur if you have good foot hygiene, regularly washing your feet reduces the number of bacteria present. So, if you happen to get a cut, there will be less microbes around to get into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"They are there waiting for an opportunity to cause an infection. So, it's really important that people with diabetes are keeping on top of their foot hygiene, because they're at more risk of developing infection because of that," says Wilkinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;To make matters worse, people with diabetes also have an impaired immune response, so if they do get an infection, their body can't fight it off. Diabetes patients are also prone to cuts, wounds, and sores in the feet that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(05)67700-8/abstract" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;don't heal&lt;/a&gt;. If these aren't caught early, then toes, feet, or even limbs may need to be amputated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"If you have uncontrolled diabetes, you may have damage to the nerves in your feet, so you can't feel your feet properly," says Wilkinson. "Just the act of washing allows you to properly check your feet for any minor abrasions or dryness that might contribute to having an infection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;A lot of people think that if you have a shower and you kind of just let the water trickle, that that's washing feet, but it isn't – Holly Wilkinson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But what about everyone else? Some experts argue that for most people, washing the feet every day has little health benefit, and can even raise the risk of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/instance/2631732/pdf/11294712.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;skin problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Overwashing the skin can disrupt the skin barrier, stripping the skin of natural oils, contributing to dryness and inflammation," says Zeichner. This leads to itchy, dry skin and can &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/eczema-from-overwashing-hands#overwashing-hands-and-eczema" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;exacerbate conditions like eczema&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It is also important not to overly scrub or exfoliate the skin on the feet," says Zeichner. "Calluses develop because of daily trauma. But they actually protect the feet from the environment. Removing calluses takes away that protection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;There is also a concern that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/are-antibacterial-products-with-triclosan-fueling-bacterial-resistance-2019080617473" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;antibacterial soaps&lt;/a&gt; could upset the delicate balance of microorganisms on the skin, killing the beneficial species and allowing the emergence of hardier, pathogenic strains that are resistant to antibiotics. Finally, our immune system needs to be challenged to a certain extent by microbes in order to do its job. If we don't come into contact with a steady stream of bacteria and viruses in childhood, then our bodies don't learn how to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/showering-daily-is-it-necessary-2019062617193" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;properly respond to attack&lt;/a&gt;. Some experts believe that &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/culture/article/20240423-theres-no-need-to-shower-every-day-heres-why" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;bathing or showering too frequently&lt;/a&gt; could actually be counterproductive for you for this very reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l017sg.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l017sg.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l017sg.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l017sg.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l017sg.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l017sg.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l017sg.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l017sg.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l017sg.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l017sg.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Gorka Olmo/BBC The microbes that live on our feet are actually serve an important purpose, helping to repel harmful bacteria (Credit: Gorka Olmo/ BBC)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Gorka Olmo/BBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;The microbes that live on our feet are actually serve an important purpose, helping to repel harmful bacteria (Credit: Gorka Olmo/ BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;So that leaves us with the perennial question, how often should we wash our feet? The answer depends to some extent on the individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"For people with diabetes, it is 100% advised that you wash your feet every day," says Wilkinson. "But if you don't have any underlying conditions, then dermatologists tend to advise that every couple of days is more than enough to maintain good hygiene, without stripping too much of the natural oils on your skin."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, Wilkinson points out that if you're somebody likes to run or work out at the gym, then you will obviously need to wash your feet more regularly than somebody who is less active. It's also not just the frequency of washing that's important either. How you wash and dry your feet also has health implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"A lot of people think that if you have a shower and you kind of just let the water trickle, that that's washing feet, but it isn't – you need to actually physically wash your feet with soapy water," says Wilkinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, according to Dan Baumgardt, a GP and lecturer in neuroscience and physiology at the University of Bristol in the UK, the most important thing he stresses to patients is to make sure you dry your feet properly. "When you've got wetness or dampness in between the toes that's allowed to just remain there in a warm environment, that's when you're prone to developing things like athlete's foot and other fungal infections," says Baumgardt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="facebook" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="x" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="instagram" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b id="." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxQazFQajFYcmxJaWhwUV9aaUh3YXc4VjRSYmhRMllXXzU3cTJUWFozUk9QaUNzV0NRcW5Nd1drczR4RElUMzBvbzYweE51bGt5WWIzNW9lVkRETV9UOFF0aXh6TEItV2pmVm9FbkFnME5qVFZOQ1J6WVRfMEkzMW8zcmx3NkZCdw</guid></item><item><title>Dentists Recommend The Dental Products They Can't Live Without - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxQbS15MmY0SEs3RmZTb3NsNlQwU0pHT0NIOXIwNVVHZXpvRkMwenZicVYtQ29tMFhHbTc1YjY0MC1obGxJZHFSZ1lBMC1tRnNHbVprdTdCZVgxMlk0aGRsRkRvczAwek8xblVuOVpJRl9qV0ZmaDZjUWVZdnFYd3VpTnpjaFVQSV8zN0lPZHh3UlZNalNpQVgwa3BLS1BYd9IBowFBVV95cUxNZWNiOTRDZmJZZG1ZUzZUbW5uTThaTktUYkxITTRXdTEzdmF4cWVEdWw5ckcxNWhnRGIya3BzVHlnNEdidU9YR2lYOVdDUkZkNFBpd2QyZ0lvWVhXUERFWUkwNHRnNkZtcmExMlhTMUdlM0VGck1idlNxS1J5Z0FydVhFSzRINk1aTGFVS1h5TEtwYU1CTGdnZ0ZmUDhRWjdad0JR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking proper care of your teeth is quite possibly one of the most important things you can do for your health.

                TikTok videos on ADHD — attention deficit hyperactivity disorder — are often not backed up by credible sources.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;As more Americans suspect they have ADHD — &lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd" target="_blank"&gt;attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt; — social media platforms have become go-to spots for sharing symptoms and getting advice.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's especially true on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On the app, popular content on #ADHD and related hashtags have amassed hundreds of millions of views, tapping into humor or themes that feel relatable to many who live with the mental health condition. And therapists say it's undoubtedly helped &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/23/nx-s1-5272801/adhd-research-shorter-life-expectancy-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder" target="_blank"&gt;lead many adults to a diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; after years of being overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0319335" target="_blank"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; also carries a warning.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Fewer than half of the claims in the top videos accurately match the scientific criteria that form an ADHD diagnosis. Many oversimplified or &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/05/29/527654633/adult-adhd-cant-be-diagnosed-with-a-simple-screening-test-doctors-warn" target="_blank"&gt;overstated the symptoms of ADHD&lt;/a&gt;, and weren't backed up by reliable sources.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Many content creators were also selling something related to ADHD via links in their profiles or posts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And even more concerning: The study suggests a heavy diet of this TikTok content shapes how people perceive ADHD, and not necessarily for the better.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"People who consumed more also felt worse about their own symptoms," says &lt;a href="https://psych.ubc.ca/profile/vasileia-karasavva/" target="_blank"&gt;Vasileia Karasavva&lt;/a&gt;, the study's author and a postdoctoral student at the University of British Columbia. "They thought they were worse and harder to cope with."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The work expands on &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2831638" target="_blank"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; that has identified the spread of misleading content related to ADHD on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you spend enough time on TikTok, you're going to find hundreds of videos that you could walk away from saying, 'That's me, I think I have ADHD," says &lt;a href="https://artsandsciences.syracuse.edu/people/faculty/antshel-phd-kevin-/" target="_blank"&gt;Kevin Antshel, a clinical psychologist at Syracuse University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At the same time, there's also a growing recognition of ADHD in adults, including many who weren't diagnosed as children. The U.S. has no guidelines specifically for adults with ADHD, and efforts are underway to roll those out later this year.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Therapists acknowledge social media is meeting a very real need, especially for people who've been traditionally overlooked. "It's a mixed bag," says &lt;a href="https://psychiatry.uw.edu/profile/maggie-sibley/" target="_blank"&gt;Maggie Sibley&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical psychologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine. "It's a great thing when people who have experiences with ADHD that have been unrecognized for decades finally get the care they need,&lt;em&gt;" she says.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;What TikTok gets wrong&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the study, two experienced psychologists ranked the top 100 TikTok videos, which at the time had nearly half a billion views. They gave each a score based on how closely the claims aligned with the&lt;a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm" target="_blank"&gt; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&lt;/a&gt;, known as the DSM 5.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"A lot of them lacked nuance," says Karasavva. "Some of the things they were describing wouldn't apply to all people with ADHD or also could apply to people without ADHD."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Next, close to 850 college students were asked to watch and score the five most and least accurate videos as ranked by the clinicians. Then they answered questions about their TikTok habits.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those who watched more of this content were more likely to recommend these videos, regardless of their accuracy. They also tended to overestimate the prevalence of ADHD as nearly 30%.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In reality,&lt;a href="https://caddac.ca/about-adhd/#:~:text=Attention%20Deficit%20Hyperactivity%20Disorder%20(ADHD,the%20country%20has%20the%20disorder." target="_blank"&gt; it's roughly 5% &lt;/a&gt;in Canada, and&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/adhd/php/adults/index.html" target="_blank"&gt; 6% in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Karasavva says their findings raise questions about how TikTok is shaping views of ADHD more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A constant stream of this content could lead people "to become hyper aware of lapses in concentration or small mistakes that we all make," she says. That might explain why people view symptoms as more severe and widespread when they watch more videos.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;TikTok meets a need&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But it's not exactly a mystery why these videos resonate. They can be funny and entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Going through a list of diagnostic symptoms, I imagine that's kind of boring for people to watch," Karasavva says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In fact, Sibley, at the University of Washington, recalls how early on some "well-meaning clinicians" tried to get on TikTok with a more conventional approach.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"But who wants to watch them? Nobody," she says, "Social media algorithms like TikTok reward novelty. The tried-and-true science is probably not going to be as popular."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Clinicians who focus on treating ADHD say they regularly encounter the downstream effects of this social media ecosystem that has sprung up around ADHD, when patients show up at their clinics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They already have a self-diagnosis that's been made based on this content, and arrive at our office telling us they have ADHD," Antshel says. "In fact, quite often now they're telling us the type and the dose of medication they want to treat this."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;As he sees it, the major concern is that people end up pursuing unnecessary treatment. For adults under 65 who use stimulants, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2831638" target="_blank"&gt;more than a quarter report misuse&lt;/a&gt; — a well-known problem on college campuses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says some of this TikTok content also tends to blur the line between ADHD and symptoms that may actually point to other mental health conditions like anxiety, depression and trauma.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Antshel stresses social media is clearly "filling a void" and for some people it can provide answers after struggling for decades.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="https://health.osu.edu/health/mental-health/survey-adults-and-undiagnosed-adhd" target="_blank"&gt;some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, one in four adults in the U.S suspect they have ADHD. Social media is likely one of many factors at play.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;ADHD exists on a spectrum, Sibley says. The average American may have two or three symptoms, but this doesn't mean they have the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"ADHD isn't a temporary response to your environment," she says, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/23/nx-s1-5272801/adhd-research-shorter-life-expectancy-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder" target="_blank"&gt;"It's a largely genetic condition&lt;/a&gt; that you'll see the thread of throughout someone's life."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While there are certainly some concerns, Sibley — who's involved in developing the new ADHD adult guidelines — welcomes the novel ideas coming from places like TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That is just fodder for us," she says,&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sibley believes researchers should listen with an open-mind — and then rigorously study what holds up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Severe pain in the lower abdomen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you notice pain in the lower quadrants of your stomach that persists and is sharp and unbearable, then that could mean a trip to the ER may be warranted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Not all lower stomach pain is serious, but &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.adventhealth.com/find-doctor/doctor/douglas-j-sprung-md-1821196064" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Douglas Sprung" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d48614e4b034e451a5e440" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.adventhealth.com/find-doctor/doctor/douglas-j-sprung-md-1821196064" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Douglas Sprung&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a gastroenterologist at The Gastroenterology Group in Florida, said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;that you’ll want to be cautious of appendicitis, which is mostly in the right lower quadrant, and diverticulitis, which is mostly in the left lower quadrant. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Swelling in the abdomen or other accompanying symptoms. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to stomach pain, if you have other worsening symptoms like swelling, that means you should go to the emergency room straight away. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Abdominal pain associated with swelling of the abdomen, abdominal tenderness ― that is, touching or pushing on the abdomen worsens the pain, or chest pain, persistent vomiting or yellowing of the skin (jaundice) is concerning,” Raufman said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Pain with fever or bleeding.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If abdominal pain is associated with rectal bleeding or vomiting blood, or severe abdominal pain with concomitant fever, sweats and chills, these are times to consider going to the ER/hospital for medical evaluation, blood testing and ultrasound testing,” Sprung said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there cases where you should try to treat your pain at home first?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If your stomach pain doesn’t exactly match the descriptions above ― or you don’t think it’s severe enough to warrant a trip to the emergency room right away ― then there’s some things you can try at home first to see if it helps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For starters, Raufman suggested going easy on your diet to see if it helps your symptoms. Eat foods like “crackers, bananas or other easily digestible foods and [drink] plenty of water,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;Get Our Lifestyle Coverage Ad-Free&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost-control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our reporters rely on research, expert advice and lived experiences.

However, Jessie said the recommended daily protein intake, which was '0.8 grams of protein per kilo body weight per day (which is about 56 grams of protein per day for a 150-pound or 68-kg person), was a joke' and added that the intake should be closer to '2 grams of protein per kilo body weight per day' as people should be eating 'way more protein'.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="shortEntryContainer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Karan Rajan reacted to her statement by saying in a video, “I have a confession to make. In 2018, on a routine blood test, I found out that I have high cholesterol levels. This was a time when I was fixated on protein, mainly animal protein and I had a scarcity of fibre in my body. A year later, in my reformed meat enthusiast journey after ramping up my fibre intake to 30 grams a day and cutting down my meat consumption, my cholesterol levels normalised.”&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Balanced diet with protein-rich and fibre-rich foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then said that you can also consider a balanced approach that includes both plant-based and animal-based protein sources, adding, “I don't think macronutrient tribalism serves us well. We don't need to create this false dichotomy of team protein versus team fibre. You can and should have good levels of both in your diet. To this point, my biggest takeaway from years of getting things wrong and learning from people smarter than me is that plant-based protein sources are not incomplete. This, which I also used to believe, is about as accurate as your uncle's Facebook medical advice.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Plant vs animal protein sources: Which is better?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/htcity/wellness/world-protein-day-can-indian-diets-meet-protein-needs-101740633082616.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual"&gt;Plant-based protein sources&lt;/a&gt; include legumes (lentils, chickpeas, beans), nuts and seeds (almonds, chia seeds, hemp seeds), whole grains (quinoa, brown rice, whole wheat), soy products (tofu, tempeh, edamame), as well as vegetables (broccoli, spinach, kale). While, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/following-all-animal-protein-rich-meal-plan-beware-of-3-biggest-mistakes-you-could-be-making-on-carnivore-diet-101741927822915.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual"&gt;animal-based protein sources&lt;/a&gt; include lean meats (chicken, turkey, fish), eggs, dairy products (milk, Greek yoghurt, paneer), red meat (beef, pork, lamb) and poultry (duck, goose, game meats).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Rajan further said, “In terms of digestibility, the difference between plant and animal proteins is much smaller than you've been led to believe. By all means, go full whack on protein consumption, but consider getting a diversity of protein sources in your diet. For example, from plant sources, unlike animal proteins, these come prepackaged with fibres, resistance starches, and phytochemicals, which act as prebiotics to feed your good bacteria. It is true that we don't have a protein deficiency pandemic like we do with fibre, and health is not an either/or concept – you don't need to cut out protein or become a vegan, everything is about balance and moderation. You can be a protein and a fibre demon at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By understanding the roles of protein and fibre in the body and making informed choices about your diet, you can support overall health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to know who you can trust with your life’s most valued possessions. Sometimes even close family members aren’t trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mm-player"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read how &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/uh2t0f/greedy_grabbers_get_exactly_what_they_take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one Redditor&lt;/a&gt; recalls a story of one major family betrayal that doesn’t go as planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s read all the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Greedy grabbers get exactly what they take&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweet older lady in our church was a retired nurse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never married, no kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had a heart attack, and while she was in the hospital, her niece and nephew thought she was dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the niece and nephew got greedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They came and TOOK HER STUFF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her apartment was small but she had some very nice crystal and silver, and some lovely antique furniture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman realized her apartment had been ransacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she came home, she had no dishes and almost no furniture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Niece and nephew denied it, but the neighbors had seen them carting everything away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, this woman had the ultimate revenge plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several years later, she passed away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her most recent will, dated after her heart attack, left one dollar each to her niece and nephew. Everything else went to the church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her estate was NINE MILLION DOLLARS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does Reddit have to say about this ultimate revenge on these crooks? Read below to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Redditor provided a legal reason for the dollar given.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A Florida man in his 70s contracted an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326340/"&gt;extremely rare&lt;/a&gt;, life-threatening infection in his &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/defibrillators"&gt;implanted defibrillator&lt;/a&gt; after eating a feral pig in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before cooking and consuming the gift from a local hunter, the man remembers handling the raw meat with bare hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts suspect it was at this moment that he was unknowingly exposed to a sneaky bacterium, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brucella_suis"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Brucella suis&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later, the man began experiencing feverish symptoms, intermittent pain, excess fluid, and a hardening of the skin on the left side of his chest, according to a case study, led by infectious disease specialist Jose Rodriguez from the University of Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When doctors finally figured out what was going on, the insidious bacterial infection had already slipped into the man's defibrillator, passing through the chest wall, the left subclavian vein, and into the muscular tissue of his left ventricle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The safest option was to replace the medical device completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155664" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155664" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/24-1721-F2-642x565.jpg" alt="Defibrillator Infection" class="size-medium wp-image-155664" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/24-1721-F2-642x565.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/24-1721-F2-472x415.jpg 472w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/24-1721-F2-768x676.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/24-1721-F2-600x528.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/24-1721-F2.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155664" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;PET scans showing markers of infection surrounding the cardiac defibrillator generator device. (Rodriguez et al., &lt;em&gt;Emerging Infectious Diseases&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, brucellosis is the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4498663/"&gt;most common bacterial infection&lt;/a&gt; that spreads from animals to humans, and it is usually carried by cows, goats, sheep, and pigs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infections of &lt;em&gt;B. suis&lt;/em&gt; and its close relatives are tricky to treat because they can hide inside immune cells for years on end, causing only mild, feverish symptoms that come and go at random. Since the bacteria are hard to isolate and grow in the lab and easily misidentified, as occurred in this case, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1109966616301506"&gt;blood tests&lt;/a&gt; don't always pick them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defibrillators are a perfect place for &lt;em&gt;Brucella&lt;/em&gt; bacteria to hide. Antibiotics are difficult to deliver to these implants because of their limited blood supply, which means that if infected, taking out the whole device is often the only way to ensure proper treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While severe and life-threatening, a &lt;em&gt;Brucella&lt;/em&gt; infection of a defibrillator is extremely rare. In a &lt;a href="https://www.journal-of-cardiology.com/article/S0914-5087(12)00241-9/fulltext"&gt;30-year review&lt;/a&gt; of 5,287 patients with a defibrillator, only one patient had a &lt;em&gt;Brucella&lt;/em&gt; infection requiring complete device and lead removal with antibiotic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of unfortunate events led to the Florida man's diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2019, long after the man had handled raw pig meat, he began experiencing uncomfortable symptoms on the left side of his chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unfortunate fellow, who also suffers from type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="155615" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and heart failure, was admitted to the hospital several times that year, where he was treated with a whole host of antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His blood cultures revealed an infection with a different bacterium from &lt;em&gt;B. suis&lt;/em&gt;, and an ultrasound of his heart showed his defibrillator had migrated to the left chest wall, just below the nipple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, his symptoms persisted, so the man sought treatment once again at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Gainesville, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While doctors could find no outward sign of bacteria on his defibrillator's valves or leads, they were concerned by the possibility of an overlooked infection, and so they decided to take the automated implant out of his body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lab analysis later confirmed the device was contaminated by &lt;i&gt;B. suis&lt;/i&gt;. The previous bacterium was a misidentification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155668" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155668" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/24-1721-F1-642x179.jpg" alt="Bacteria Heart Defibrillator" class="size-medium wp-image-155668" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/24-1721-F1-642x179.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/24-1721-F1-768x214.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/24-1721-F1-600x167.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/24-1721-F1.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155668" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Blood samples showing &lt;em&gt;Brucella suis&lt;/em&gt; infection (pink clumps) in the Florida man. (Rodriguez et al., &lt;em&gt;Emerging Infectious Diseases&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Substantial delays between &lt;em&gt;Brucella&lt;/em&gt; exposure and clinical symptoms have been previously reported in patients with cardiac implantable electronic device infections," &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/4/24-1721_article"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the authors of the case study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In this case, the intermittent use of antibiotics with device retainment likely led to a prolonged clinical course."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After six weeks of taking two antibiotics, the man's infection was cleared.The patient was outfitted with a new defibrillator four months after his old one was removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, more than three years later, his blood shows no clinical evidence of brucellosis. His story is a cautionary tale to all who partake in eating unpasteurized dairy products or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/zombie-deer-disease-zoonotic-transfer-suspected-after-two-human-deaths"&gt;wild animals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-25"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;23rd March 2025 – (Springfield)  A 48-year-old man from Springfield, Missouri, has recounted his unexpected battle with stage four colorectal cancer, initially prompted by a single symptom he chose to ignore. Shawn Michael has shared his experiences in a video that has garnered significant attention on social media, attracting nearly 100,000 views after being featured on The Patient Story’s YouTube channel last month.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Michael’s diagnosis came as a shock to both him and his family, particularly as he had previously been dealing with what he thought was a milder issue. In October of last year, he experienced bowel complications and attributed them to constipation. Despite trying various over-the-counter remedies without success, he sought assistance from an urgent care centre, where he received a powerful treatment that momentarily eased his discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;However, Michael felt that something was still amiss. He described the immense pain that lingered and returned to urgent care for further examination. A subsequent CT scan revealed a significant mass in his colon, necessitating immediate surgery. Alongside the blockage, doctors discovered additional concerning masses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the operation, surgeons removed a large segment of Michael’s colon and identified several sizeable tumours on his omentum, a layer of fat encasing the colon. Remarkably, the obstruction had not ruptured, a fortunate circumstance that had slowed the spread of cancer to other organs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the surgery was deemed successful and all visible cancer was excised, some remnants remain in his body. Michael is now preparing to undergo three months of chemotherapy, hopeful that the treatment will eradicate the remaining cancerous cells and enable his recovery. Despite the challenges ahead, both he and his medical team remain optimistic given his age and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;


        &lt;/div&gt;

At my regular annual physical, I asked my doctor whether he would do a PSA test, as other doctors had done for over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;He pivoted his monitor to me. The image was of 100 little blue silhouettes of men. He stated that very few men (those shaded in gray) die of prostate cancer. The vast majority would die from other causes. He said the harms of screening outweighed the benefits, but added derisively, “I’ll do it if you want.” I got the message; a test wasn’t done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Years later I learned the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued definitive guidelines in 2012 not to screen for prostate cancer. It said knowing about prostate cancer led to treatments that didn’t extend life, but harmed men who underwent prostatectomies. They concluded that it was better for doctor and patient alike to not know if any patient had prostate cancer. In part, what drove this conclusion was a 2008-09 Health and Human Services (HHS) study of prostate cancer as a cost driver in medical care. The study concluded that PSA testing leads to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. That conclusion was fed to the USPSTF, whose guidelines disregarded the fact that 10-20% of men may have an aggressive form of cancer — a cancer that can kill. Those men become collateral damage to a guideline that seeks to protect the other 80-90%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Most men with prostate cancer will indeed not die principally of prostate cancer. However, those with an aggressive form may see their lives shortened by five to seven years or more, and undergo harsher, more costly treatment, assuming their cancer is even caught. In the seven years after the 2012 guidelines were issued, fewer prostate cancers were diagnosed and treated. Yet the rate of aggressive cancers diagnosed rose at the rate of 4-7% a year. Because fewer prostatectomies were done, there were some cost savings. However, those cost savings were offset by the cost of treating aggressive cancers, which can be orders of magnitude greater.

In what became known as “shared decisionmaking,” the burden of deciding on screening is now put on patients. This sleight-of-hand gives primary-care physicians deniability for any harm to patients.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest analysis to examine the best way to lower levels of "bad" cholesterol in patients with blocked arteries shows that they should immediately be given a combination of a statin and another drug called ezetimibe, rather than statins alone. This could prevent thousands of deaths a year from heart attacks, strokes and other cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/meta-analysis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of 108,353 patients in 14 studies who were at very high risk of suffering heart attack or stroke, or who had already suffered one of these cardiovascular events is published in the journal &lt;i&gt;Mayo Clinic Proceedings&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It shows that when ezetimibe was combined with a high dose statin to reduce levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), there was a significant 19% reduction in the risk of death from any cause, a 16% reduction in deaths from cardiovascular causes, and a significant reduction in the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events or stroke by 18% and 17% respectively, compared to high doses of statins alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination therapy also significantly reduced LDL-C levels by an extra 13mg per deciliter (dL) of blood compared to statins alone, measured from the baseline—the time at which the patient first started the treatment. This increased the chances of reaching the ideal goal of less than 70mg/dL of LDL-C by 85%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results were even more pronounced in the network meta-analysis, which enables a direct comparison of different therapy regimens used in the study. This showed a 49% reduction in all-cause mortality and a 39% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events, when compared to high-dose statin therapy alone," said first author, Maciej Banach, Professor of Cardiology at the John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin, Poland, and Adjunct Professor at the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Banach also leads the International Lipid Expert Panel and the Blood Pressure Meta-analysis Collaboration group that carried out the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The combination therapy is safe and efficacious; the risk of adverse events and the therapy discontinuation rate was comparable between groups. In the network meta-analysis, we showed a significant 44% reduction in the risk of discontinuation in those treated with moderately high-dose statin therapy plus ezetimibe versus a high-dose statin alone."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, there have been inconsistent findings about whether or not combined cholesterol-lowering therapy should be given to high-risk patients immediately, even before they suffer a heart attack or stroke, or whether doctors should start these patients on a high-dose statin first and monitor the effects on cholesterol levels after at least two months before deciding if the patients need ezetimibe as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-author of the study, Peter Toth, Professor of Clinical Family and Community Medicine, University of Illinois, and Adjunct Associate Professor of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University, U.S., said, "This study confirms that combined cholesterol-lowering therapy should be considered immediately and should be the gold standard for treatment of very high-risk patients after an acute cardiovascular event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Simply adding ezetimibe to statin therapy, without waiting for at least two months to see the effects of statin monotherapy, which is suboptimal in many patients, is associated with more effective LDL-C goal achievement and is responsible for significant incremental reductions in cardiovascular health problems and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"This approach does not require additional funding or reimbursement of new expensive drugs. In fact, it may translate into lower rates of first and subsequent heart attacks and stroke, and their complications like heart failure, which are extremely costly for all health care systems."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to data from the Global Burden of Disease and the American Heart Association, deaths occurring as a result of high LDL-C alone are highest in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38092509/" target="_blank"&gt;4.5 million deaths worldwide&lt;/a&gt; were attributed to it in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Banach said, "Cardiovascular disease kills around 20 million people a year worldwide. Based on our previous analysis, we estimate that if combination therapy to reduce LDL-C was included in all treatment guidelines and implemented by doctors everywhere for patients with high cholesterol levels, it would prevent over 330,000 deaths a year among patients who have already suffered a heart attack, and almost 50,000 deaths alone in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We recommend &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/combination+therapy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;combination therapy&lt;/a&gt; should be considered the gold standard of treatment for these patients and included in all future treatment guidelines."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statins have been used safely for years. They help to lower LDL-C by reducing the production of it by the liver. Ezetimibe reduces the amount of cholesterol that the body takes from food by inhibiting the absorption of it in the intestines.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Some patients do not respond adequately to statins and are prescribed ezetimibe in combination with a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/statin/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;statin&lt;/a&gt;. High doses of statins are known as "high intensity" statins and moderately high doses are known as "moderate intensity" or "medium intensity" statins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Toth said, "Our findings underline the importance of the adages 'the lower for better for longer' but also the equally important 'the earlier the better' for treating patients at high risk of cardiovascular conditions and to avoid further medical complications and deaths."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strength of the study is its large size, as it includes the greatest number of patients studied so far. The patients were included in 14 studies, 11 of which were randomized controlled trials and three were cohort studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limitations relate mainly to the type of studies that were included in the meta-analysis, including their size and the observational nature of some of them.&lt;/p&gt;

The fox repeatedly attacked and bit the hunter’s shoes. The fox was subdued, captured and sent for testing to the Alabama Department of Public Health laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="63HZGCEBKVCCTAY4RS5SPRMOH4"&gt;The hunter has begun receiving the post-exposure prophylaxis series of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="X3MVKDITR5ECBPZYCX7FSRVDTE"&gt;“This is a good reminder as the warmer months get underway to remember to vaccinate your animals and to report any strange-acting wildlife,” said Dr. Dee W.

He said that additional testing is being performed on the fox to determine the strain of rabies. He said it is expected to be the raccoon strain, the primary reservoir of rabies in terrestrial animals in Alabama, including this area of Lowndes County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FZSHDJ4N6JDJVIP2DZHNTMQJHI"&gt;Instances of wildlife species attacking people is not common, but it does happen because of the altered mental states the virus causes in the animal, Jones said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" class="middleParagraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="X3XWUX2W55GXNGJBN6TCVPLGTM"&gt;Alabama state law requires that dogs, cats and ferrets 12 weeks of age and older be current with rabies vaccination. Although there are animal rabies vaccines that last for one year or three years, the first rabies vaccination is only good for one year, regardless of which vaccine a pet receives. Vaccinating animals reduces the risk of rabies infection should an exposure occur; thus, vaccinations help protect animals, as well as their owners and caretakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OUGFBNHKCBCW5K7H6N5OJCTHPY"&gt;Rabies prevention is multifaceted. It involves people taking precautions with wildlife, making sure their pets are current on rabies vaccinations, and always reporting an animal bite or other exposure to their medical provider or ADPH.

&lt;p&gt;(WKBN) — If you’re not getting enough sleep, you may feel tired and groggy, but it can also make you hungrier. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors say sleep deprivation impacts our hormones and may make us eat more the next day. We also tend to crave more unhealthy foods when we’re tired. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctor Nancy Foldvary with the Cleveland Clinic says if you’re having trouble sleeping, it’s important to create a regular nighttime routine and aim to wake up at the same time each day. She also says avoiding an afternoon cup of coffee can help as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="nojq1euy" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Caffeine can have a widely variable half-life. It can linger in the central nervous system far beyond what you might expect, and so some of us are really sensitive to that and really can’t have caffeine beyond early morning,” Foldvary said. “Certainly, drinking caffeine or eating foods with caffeine — including chocolate — after noon or 2 p.m. is likely to lead to some sleep fragmentation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you continue to toss and turn at night, Foldvary recommends seeing a sleep specialist for help and to rule out any underlying sleep disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

It's not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers in the UK recently studied the cases of 21 children, ranging in age from two to seven-year-old, who were hospitalized shortly after drinking a single 'zero-sugar' slushie that was artificially sweetened with glycerol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yes, you read that right. A single slushie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In the U.S. Glycerol is just one of 10,000 chemicals that the food industry can legally sneak into your food under an FDA loophole created by Congress in 1958.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most of the children lost consciousness. Four needed brain scans. One had a seizure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The newly identified condition is being called 'glycerol intoxication syndrome.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In adults, too much glycerol can cause headaches, nausea, dizziness, and bloating. But children's bodies are smaller, their metabolism works differently, and when they consume too much glycerol at once, their blood sugar can drop so fast that they can black out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of course, glycerol isn't new. It's been added to food for decades – only now, the food industry is using more of it. A lot more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some jurisdictions in the US have implemented 'sugar taxes' or surcharges on sweetened beverages to discourage their consumption by making them more expensive. And the public has also become far more health conscious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So Big Food has responded by cutting down on sugar content. But the food industry is also desperate to keep things sweet, so they've loaded up their products with sugar substitutes, like glycerol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also known as glycerin, this additive is a sugar alcohol. It's not sugar, but it tastes like it. And kids are consuming more of it in than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Slushies in the UK are some of the biggest offenders, because either sugar or glycerol is needed to keep the drinks from freezing into solid blocks of goo. And the result is children are getting dosed with more sugar alcohol than their little bodies can handle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But here's the truly shocking part: glycerol is technically considered 'safe' by the Food and Drug Administration and some European Union food agencies. Though let's be real: 'safe' according to these food regulators may only mean 'not immediately lethal'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, glycerol is one of 10,000 chemicals that the food industry can legally sneak into your food under an FDA loophole created by Congress in 1958.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Back then 'Generally Recognized As Safe' or GRAS standards were established to exempt certain food additives – like salt, yeast, flour and eggs – from the FDA's rigorous pre-market review and approval processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That meant no independent testing and no long-term studies. Food manufacturers got to decide for themselves if something was 'safe' before adding it to your favorite snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Also known as glycerin, this additive is a sugar alcohol. It's not sugar, but it tastes like it. And kids are consuming more of it in than ever before (stock image).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But here's the good news. On Thursday, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to eliminate GRAS standards for many foods sold in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We've launched a review of the GRAS standards, and we're going to get rid of the GRAS standards for most products,' Kennedy told Fox News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We have 10,000 [GRAS] ingredients [in the US]… and in Europe they only have 400, and [Americans] have the worst chronic disease burden of any country in the world.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Go figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is undoubtably a great step towards addressing America's health crisis but there's no reason to wait for Kennedy to act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You aren't powerless. You have agency, and it's time to start using it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Read every damn label. If it says glycerol, glycerin, or E422 (a European Union designation) — put it back on the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Avoid buying ultra processed food for yourself and your kids as often as possible. I know — it's easy, it's convenient, and they love it. But what's more important? Their long-term health or a momentary tantrum?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Demand better. Food companies aren't really going to change unless we force them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speak up. Complain. Stop buying from brands that put profit over people. Educate your kids. Teach them to recognize garbage ingredients and make better choices. They're never too young to learn how to protect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end of the day, you are the gatekeeper of what goes into your body and your child. Stay informed, stay vigilant, and don't trust that, just because something is sold in a store, it's safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Jillian is a TV star, author and health expert.
