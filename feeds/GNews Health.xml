The rest are due to complications from localized tumors or blood cancers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When you look at the literature, you quickly realize that 70 percent of cancer patients do not succumb to the primary tumor, but the metastatic spread,’ Rodriguez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After years of research in chemical biology that can be leveraged to fight cancer , Dr Raphael Rodriguez and his team have developed a molecule that could save millions from deaths caused by the cancer spreading to other parts of the body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I realized the gap. The treatments we have are not sufficient — they are not designed to target metastasis, and they are not designed to target the capacity of a cell to migrate.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer cells hoard iron in special compartments called lysosomes, which makes them more aggressive — but also gives them a hidden weakness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That same iron can trigger a process called ferroptosis, which destroys the cancer cell from the inside out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rodriguez said: ‘We conceptualize the fact that cancer cells can exploit iron chemistry to adapt, to change identity, to be plastic, to become invasive.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But at the same time, he said, iron is chemically active (redox-active), meaning it easily reacts with molecules in cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The paper that we just published exploits that finding, basically: could we develop a compound that would accumulate inside of the cell where iron is loaded, and can we manipulate the chemistry of iron?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rodriguez, a French biochemist, helped develop Fentomycin-1, a molecule that supercharges ferroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In early lab tests, metastatic cancer cells were wiped out in less than 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cancer cells aggressively stockpile iron in lysosomes to fuel their spread—but this creates a fatal flaw. The same iron can trigger ferroptosis, a self-destruct mechanism that corrodes tumors from within&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And this was spectacular,’ Rodriguez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘At this point in time, cancer patients are dying — specifically in this population [with these cancers]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And it was very gratifying for us to see that we are capable of designing a compound that does what we wanted to do.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team tested Fento-1 in aggressive forms of pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and sarcomas, a group of rare malignant tumors that form in bones or soft tissues — all known for drug resistance, high iron levels, and grim survival rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In mice injected with breast cancer cells, the drug slowed tumor growth and activated the immune system, potentially offering a one-two punch with existing treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also worked well in combination with chemotherapy, especially in pancreatic cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rodriguez’s lab even tested tumor samples taken directly from patients after surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The compound reduced the number of cells with CD44, a protein that helps cancer resist drugs and spread to new organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rodriguez's team tested Fento-1 in aggressive forms of pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and sarcomas, a group of rare malignant tumors that form in bones or soft tissues — all known for drug resistance, high iron levels, and grim survival rates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because cancer cells have higher iron levels than surrounding healthy tissue, Fento-1 can target tumors with precision, leaving normal cells relatively unharmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clinical trials will be needed to determine if these molecules could be leveraged as new cancer treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before then, Rodriguez said, his team will have to raise funds for the next stage of research, which will establish basic knowledge about how the compound might interact with living human cells in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Rodriguez is clear — getting there will take funding, testing, and more time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There are a few other [data sets] that are not published, and what we now need to do is [figure out] can we scale up the compound, is it stable, is it bioavailable, can we take it by IV, how does it get decomposed inside the body, what is the clearance of it?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘At this point in time,’ he added, ‘we are happy with the compound we made.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His team's findings were published in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08974-4"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Metastatic cancer cells are adept at resisting chemotherapy by developing ways to prevent the medicine from entering the cell, and radiation treatments, by learning how to repair any damage done to their DNA to help them survive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When cancer cells spread beyond their original site in the body, or metastasize, it becomes markedly more difficult to treat and reach remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Metastatic cancer cells can adapt to new, hostile environments, such as unfamiliar organs and tissues, adjusting their metabolism and outsmarting the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are also adept at resisting chemotherapy by developing ways to prevent the medicine from entering the cell, and radiation treatments, by learning how to repair any damage done to their DNA to help them survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Estimating the exact number of Americans living with metastatic cancer at any single time is challenging due to limited real-time tracking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The National Cancer Institute estimated in 2018 that there were &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/ocs?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template#:~:text=Researchers%20at%20the%20National%20Cancer,693%2C452%20by%20the%20year%202025."&gt;more than 623,000&lt;/a&gt; people in the US living with the six most common metastatic cancers - bladder, breast, colorectal, lung, melanoma, prostate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That rate was expected to increase to nearly 700,000 in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 04:48:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxPdWw5VzdjRHRrdW1TV3BPa1VXWXY2c3BsYUlQZ0JnbnlYRlNJaFQwdGd5TEdFR2V5Vk9Kd1pMVGdkSUVFYkNQQVBDdF9TWlJBZ2pQNUY4N3o1VVRNakRSb2dickhheldlTGwtVGN0eS1xRndEdkgtWkRucTZDNC1EWEdNWnQyNklPS1V3OHlwbUtsdGt1WVRBRXlJQ05KRzBVY3N5ZtIBqgFBVV95cUxQRDFtdDV5NUlaaTFWM1JMRFJYdlkzdC0wdnJ1VVpsaHNvMElKdWZTMEMwc1J1VnRpbDE3S0xMUEFobHhjTnlPQTlmNGdaRzF5bWU4NlVlYl96RGgtUktxaF9xME5QTGdGaS1SOERITXM0RVU3WjFzdTBqM21iQjlyWlpUbjdHN251TUZBM3dHU01uM1N5OHd6cmNXSWFyNVA5M0dHd2FhZmFjUQ</guid></item><item><title>在警察自杀后自杀的激光眼科手术患者数量惊人-每日邮报 | Alarming number of Lasik eye surgery patients who took their own lives revealed after police officer's suicide - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The recent suicide of a young &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pennsylvania/index.html" id="mol-c9f22d20-376d-11f0-9e0f-cf04fa396522"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; police officer has reignited concerns over Lasik eye surgery, as dozens more were pushed to the brink of death over similar complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/news/article-14733481/police-officer-effects-lasik-eye-surgery-ryan-kingerski.html"&gt;Ryan Kingerski, a 26-year-old officer with the Penn Hills Police Department, took his own life&lt;/a&gt; after months of excruciating pain, double vision and persistent headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He claimed the Lasik eye surgery he underwent five months earlier was the source of his suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, as more horror stories of agonizing symptoms surface, it's becoming increasingly clear that Kingerski's case is not isolated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Everyone has different problems when it comes to Lasik,' Edward Boshnick, a Miami-based eye doctor, told &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/22/health/doctors-former-patients-warn-of-lasik-eye-surgery-dangers/"&gt;The New York Post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's the biggest scam ever put on the American public... and it's a multi-billion dollar business.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lasik eye surgery, or laser vision correction, is marketed by providers as 95 to 99 percent safe.

Longevity is not just about living longer, it’s about feeling good as you age — strong in body &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;mind. If anyone knows about healthy aging, it’s cardiologist Eric Topol, who studied “super agers” for decades. This week, we’re sharing a few things he learned while taking a look at these ultrahealthy older folks. First up? The secret to their success is not all about genetics. With a few lifestyle tweaks, you can dramatically increase your chances of becoming a super ager yourself. But before that …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="GBRUOROFKBGXHJ7M6XROR3MGOQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="GBRUOROFKBGXHJ7M6XROR3MGOQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;This week’s must-reads:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="LLQ3JXVEVJE73JUNCWKVZJZKUY" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rough night ahead?

All qualified, he felt, as “super agers.” Turns out they shared few, if any, genetic similarities — meaning their DNA wasn’t necessarily the reason they were faring so well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QZ4WOV34PJBA5EJLRRO2NI2E34" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There was one lifestyle change that seemed to influence aging far more than any other.

But long covid is an umbrella term, and treating it as one disease is, in a way, equivalent to thinking cancer is one entity as opposed to hundreds of types, each with different diagnostics, prognosis and treatments, Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis, told our writer Richard Sima, a former neuroscientist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K32YAOJ4NVBTTEF4MSK3ULPFOU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That’s why researchers are pressing ahead with new clinical trials for more targeted treatments built on advances in our understanding of long covid. And we’re learning more every day about the condition. “It is a constellation of many things, and dissecting out those things is going to be the biggest challenge,” said Janna Moen, a neuroscientist at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O6UKG27ORFHQJABOZFNRXQZHBM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Learn more here &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/05/16/long-covid-treatments-trial-immune-system/" target="_blank"&gt;about clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; that are underway to unravel all the long-covid subtypes and biological pathways that cause this devastating condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="HLWMMVLSKNBBJPMEFN6OH7CQXU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="HLWMMVLSKNBBJPMEFN6OH7CQXU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Why are colorectal cancer rates rising in young adults?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7GISK2JFOJDPXFRCUDOHSFGQ5E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our Ask a Doctor columnist is Trisha S.

But for younger adults, the trend is rapidly going in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6059239/#djw322-F1" target="_blank"&gt;wrong direction&lt;/a&gt;. While the overall numbers are still relatively low, colorectal cancer will become the leading cause of &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2778204" target="_blank"&gt;cancer-related deaths&lt;/a&gt; for adults in their 20s, 30s and 40s by 2030. In a study recently published in Nature, scientists unveiled a link between the rise in young colorectal cancers and a toxin called colibactin, which is produced by certain bacteria in the gut. Turns out, 30 to 40 percent of healthy adults have colibactin-producing bacteria, although only a small percentage of people get cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TRL4JEUVW5COXPPGFBF5IY73AI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Read more here from Trisha on the one thing you can do to help reduce the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/05/19/why-colorectal-cancer-rising-young-people/" target="_blank"&gt;impact of colibactin&lt;/a&gt; on your digestive tract.

&lt;p&gt;Experts have been &lt;a href="https://github.com/neherlab/SARS-CoV-2_variant-reports/blob/main/reports/variant_report_latest_draft.md#global-overview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;closely watching&lt;/a&gt; the variant, which is now dominant in China and is on the rise in parts of Asia. Hong Kong authorities say that rates of COVID-19 in the city have climbed to the worst levels they have seen in at least a year, after a "significant increase" in reported emergency room visits and hospitalizations driven by COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While authorities in Hong Kong &lt;a href="https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202505/15/P2025051500748.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; there is no evidence that the variant, a descendant of the XDV lineage of the virus, is more severe, they have begun urging residents to mask when in public transportation or crowded places as cases have climbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health authorities in Taiwan have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov.tw/Bulletin/Detail/r632O45d10BEHKwQhQVm8w?typeid=9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;also reported&lt;/a&gt; a rise in emergency room visits, severe cases and deaths. Local health authorities say they are stockpiling vaccines and antiviral treatments in response to the epidemic wave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.30.651462v1.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from researchers in China suggest the NB.1.8.1 variant is not better at evading the immune system compared to other strains on the rise, but it does have a greater ability to bind to human cells, suggesting it could be more transmissible.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;"A more predictable pattern"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strain came up multiple times during a Thursday &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WX8rfa_f5o0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/food-and-drug-administration/" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;'s outside vaccine advisers, as they wrestled with whether and how to recommend updating &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/covid-19-vaccine/" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for the coming fall and winter seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines from &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-fall-2024-fda/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;last season&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; targeted a descendant of the JN.1 variant called KP.2. Early data presented to the committee by Pfizer and Moderna suggested switching to a different JN.1 descendant that has been dominant in recent months, called LP.8.1, could boost protection against NB.1.8.1, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The LP.8.1 vaccine has the highest titers against LP.8.1, which is dominant in the U.S. and many other regions and cross-neutralizes other currently circulating variants, including NB.1.8.1, a dominant JN.1 subvariant in many Asian countries," Darin Edwards, lead of Moderna's COVID-19 program, told the panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee unanimously backed recommending that the coming season's vaccines should target some kind of JN.1 variant, but was split on the details. Some favored allowing vaccine makers to stick with last season's vaccines, while others called for the update to target the LP.8.1 descendant of JN.1 that Pfizer and Moderna have prototyped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although one can't predict evolution, and you don't know how this is going to keep diversifying, the overwhelming odds are that what does come and predominate in the next few months, the next six months, next year will come from something that's circulating now. It won't come from something that doesn't exist any longer," Jerry Weir, director of the FDA's division of viral products, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, CDC and FDA officials told the panel that only one strain — a variant called XFC — has been significantly growing in the U.S. But they cautioned that the evolution of the virus has been unpredictable, even as the country has settled into a relatively predictable pattern of two surges a year: once in the summer and once over the winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This past season only saw an evolutionary "drift" in the virus, as opposed to the kind of sweeping replacements driven by highly mutated strains in some earlier years. While COVID-19 trends climbed over the winter, they remained far below previous peaks.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Throughout this winter, we didn't see that strain replacement that we have in the past couple of years. But I'm not saying that the virus will not shift again in the immediate future," the CDC's Natalie Thornburg told the panel. Thornburg is the acting chief of the laboratory branch in the CDC's division for coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rates of COVID-19 have now fallen back to low levels nationwide, measured through &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/activity-levels.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_3-emergency-department-visits-for-viral-respiratory-illness" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;emergency room visits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-nationaltrend.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;wastewater testing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do think after five years now, we are seeing very distinct patterns that [are] falling into a more predictable pattern," Thornburg said, citing a "seasonality analysis" that the agency has been working on about the virus. &lt;/p&gt;

This surprising finding has caught the attention of scientists, raising hopes that similar dietary tweaks could one day boost human health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isoleucine, a type of branched-chain amino acid, helps the body build proteins. But there's a catch—it can't be made internally. Instead, it comes from foods like eggs, meat, dairy, and soy. While essential, too much of it might do more harm than good, especially over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past studies had already hinted at a link between isoleucine and body weight. Data collected from a 2016–2017 health survey in Wisconsin showed that people with higher BMIs tended to eat more isoleucine. That clue led researchers to take a closer look at how this amino acid affects the aging process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Different components of your diet have value and impact beyond their function as a calorie,” said Dudley Lamming, a metabolism expert from the &lt;a href="https://www.wisc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; who is involved in both studies. “We've been digging in on one component that many people may be eating too much of.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Study graphical abstract: Low-protein diets promote health and longevity in diverse species. (CREDIT: Cell Metabolism) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting findings is that reducing isoleucine doesn’t just add years to life—it also improves “healthspan,” or the number of years lived in good health. Even older mice benefitted when the change was made later in life. That offers real hope for &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/common-hypertension-drug-slows-down-aging-and-can-increase-lifespan-study-finds/"&gt;aging humans&lt;/a&gt; looking for new ways to stay healthier, longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their theory, scientists used mice with diverse genetic backgrounds and divided them into three groups. One group followed a standard diet with all 20 amino acids. The second had their intake of all &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/discoveries/all-life-on-earth-originated-from-a-single-common-ancestor-millions-of-years-ago/"&gt;amino acids&lt;/a&gt; reduced by two-thirds. The third group had only isoleucine reduced by the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;All mice were free to eat as much as they wanted, but only from their assigned diets. Despite eating freely, those with less isoleucine aged more slowly and showed better markers of health. That suggests it wasn’t about calories—it was about the specific nutrients consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study opens the door to new ways of thinking about nutrition and aging. With further research, scientists hope to see if cutting back on isoleucine can safely help humans live not just longer, but better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, restricting dietary isoleucine led to a host of positive effects on the mice's health and longevity. It increased their lifespan, improved their overall healthspan, reduced frailty, and promoted leanness and glycemic control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male mice experienced a remarkable &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/lifechanging-senolytic-drugs-could-extend-human-lifespans-by-30/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;33 percent increase in lifespan&lt;/a&gt; compared to their counterparts whose isoleucine intake was not restricted, while female mice enjoyed a 7 percent increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mice exhibited significant improvements across 26 health measures, including enhanced muscle strength, endurance, better blood sugar control, improved tail function, and reduced hair loss. Notably, male mice in the low isoleucine group demonstrated less age-related prostate enlargement and a reduced likelihood of developing cancerous tumors—a common occurrence in diverse mouse strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unexpected twist in the study was that the mice with restricted isoleucine consumption actually consumed more calories than their counterparts. Despite the increased caloric intake, they managed to burn more energy and maintain &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-discover-genetic-variant-which-could-prevent-obesity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;leaner body weights&lt;/a&gt;, even though their physical activity levels remained unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Low Isoleucine Reduces Cancer Prevalence in Males. Compared to mice fed a normal diet (Control), cancer prevalence was reduced by about 25% in male (left) mice fed a low isoleucine diet (Low Ile). However, this did not occur in females (right).

However, as with all studies involving mice, there are significant challenges to overcome before translating these findings into practical human applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet is a complex chemical reaction within the body, and it is likely that other dietary components play crucial roles in achieving the observed results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;General protein restriction, for instance, has been shown to have detrimental effects on both mice and humans. Therefore, applying these findings to the real world is more intricate than merely reducing the consumption of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/higher-protein-intake-while-dieting-leads-to-healthier-eating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;high-protein foods&lt;/a&gt;, despite its simplicity in limiting isoleucine intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers highlight that the amino acid restriction level remained constant in all experiments. They acknowledge that further fine-tuning may be necessary to optimize the effects across different strains of mice and genders, emphasizing that when it comes to diet, one size does not fit all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Low Isoleucine Reduces Frailty. Compared to mice fed a normal diet (Control), mice fed a low isoleucine (Low Ile) or low protein (Low AA) diet scored lower on the frailty index (FI), suggesting reduced frailty. For males this occurred at 24, 28, and 30 months of age. For females this occurred at 24 months of age. For 22-month-old females, the Low Ile, but not Low AA group had a lower FI score than the Control group.

However, he remains hopeful, suggesting that isolating the benefits to a &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/lifechanging-amino-acid-compound-successfully-treats-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;single amino acid&lt;/a&gt; brings us one step closer to understanding the underlying biological processes and the potential development of interventions for humans, such as isoleucine-blocking drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="_10_common_foods_that_contain_significant_amounts_of_isoleucine_"&gt;10 common foods that contain significant amounts of isoleucine:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chicken: &lt;/strong&gt;Chicken is a rich source of isoleucine, with one &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/scientists-discover-surprising-link-between-zinc-levels-and-type-2-diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cooked chicken breast&lt;/a&gt; containing about 2.7 grams of isoleucine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beef: &lt;/strong&gt;Beef is another good source of isoleucine, with one cooked beef steak containing about 2.4 grams of isoleucine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Beef is another good source of isoleucine, with one cooked beef steak containing about 2.4 grams of isoleucine.

                                        &lt;p&gt;A school-aged child from Leander has tested positive for measles, Williamson County's public health department has confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Williamson County and Cities Health District said this is the first reported case of measles in the county this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child was contagious starting last Thursday, May 15, and may continue to be through Saturday, May 24. They are currently recovering in isolation at home. The agency said &lt;a href="https://www.wcchd.org/news_detail_T4_R296.php" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;in a press release&lt;/a&gt; it's working with school officials and the Texas Department of State Health Services to notify people who might have been exposed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency didn't share information about what school the child attends, where they recently traveled to or their vaccination status. The family decided not to give certain details to health officials, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials are urging people who may have been exposed to monitor for &lt;a href="https://www.wcchd.org/healthy_people/measles.php" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;symptoms of measles&lt;/a&gt;, which include fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes, white spots inside the mouth and a skin rash. If symptoms develop, reach out to a health care provider before entering a hospital so health care workers can take appropriate steps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are pregnant, have an infant or are immunocompromised should consider asking their health care provider about preemptive treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious diseases and can lead to serious complications, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine provides the best protection against the virus; the standard two doses people are recommended to receive in childhood are 97% effective at preventing infection, according to the government agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hays County &lt;a href="https://www.kut.org/health/2025-05-20/hays-county-kyle-texas-measles-case" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its first measles case of the year on Tuesday.

&lt;h2 class="dek"&gt;First described by neurologist Constantin von Economo in 1917, encephalitis lethargica infected more than 1 million people — and killed an estimated 500,000.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div id="attachment_539247" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-539247" src="https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/encephalitis-lethargica.jpg" alt="Encephalitis Lethargica" class="size-full wp-image-539247 post-img-landscape" srcset="https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/encephalitis-lethargica.jpg 900w, https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/encephalitis-lethargica-300x200.jpg 300w, https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/encephalitis-lethargica-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-539247" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Paul Bernard Foley&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption-body"&gt;Patients with encephalitis lethargica, also known as “sleeping sickness” or “sleepy sickness.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="dropcaps"&gt;Between the mid-1910s and the 1930s, an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica (EL) spread around the world, affecting more than 1 million people and leading to an estimated 500,000 deaths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mysterious neurological disease baffled physicians, as those who were infected experienced a wide variety of symptoms, including extreme tiredness, sleep disturbances, fevers, headaches, muscle pains, vision issues, psychiatric changes, and sometimes even symptoms resembling Parkinson’s disease. While many victims died of respiratory failure soon after being infected, some survivors suffered a far worse fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people who contracted EL eventually developed severe neurological disorders, like post-encephalitic Parkinsonism, and in the most extreme cases, victims were left with an immobile face, rigid muscles, and an inability to interact normally with other people. This left them in an almost statue-like state or puppet-like state — with their minds still active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that the spread of encephalitis lethargica happened around the same time as the &lt;a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/1918-flu-pandemic" target="_blank"&gt;Spanish flu pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, researchers initially believed that there may have been a link between the two conditions, but this was never conclusively proven. The exact cause of EL remains unknown to this day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more strangely, the disease seems to have vanished just as mysteriously as it appeared, barring a handful of isolated cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Emergence Of Encephalitis Lethargica&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_539244" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-539244" src="https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/spanish-flu-camp-funston.jpg" alt="Spanish Flu At Camp Funston" class="size-full wp-image-539244 post-img-landscape" srcset="https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/spanish-flu-camp-funston.jpg 900w, https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/spanish-flu-camp-funston-300x225.jpg 300w, https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/spanish-flu-camp-funston-768x575.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-539244" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Public Domain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption-body"&gt;Patients being treated for the Spanish flu at Camp Funston in Kansas. Circa 1918. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sudden emergence of EL was one of the biggest medical mysteries of the early 20th century. Some of the first cases began cropping up as early as 1916 (or perhaps even 1915), but it wasn’t until 1917 that the Austrian neurologist Constantin von Economo identified a unique pattern of symptoms among patients in Vienna. Around the same time, French physician Jean-René Cruchet reported similar cases in France. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the similarities with the symptoms, however, no one could find a definitive common cause or method of transmission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the world was still in the throes of &lt;a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/ww1-photos" target="_blank"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; at the time. And then, in the postwar period, even more death followed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1918, the H1N1 influenza known as the Spanish flu rapidly spread across the planet and affected over one-fourth of the global population. When cases of EL were appearing at the same time, it was a natural assumption that it was perhaps some horrendous side effect of the flu. But there was never any direct link established between EL and the Spanish flu virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to find a cause was made even more complicated, as Dr. Heidi Moawad noted in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.neurologylive.com/view/encephalitis-lethargica-still-unexplained-sleeping-sickness" target="_blank"&gt;NeurologyLive&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; since not all patients had the same symptoms or the same level of severity with their symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“According to the medical literature, about a third of the patients died from respiratory failure caused by neurological dysfunction,” Moawad explained. “And, while at least hundreds [of] thousands of patients died, there were at least as many who survived. Some of the survivors exhibited residual Parkinsonian or neuropsychiatric sequelae.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, a potential connection between Parkinson’s and EL was likewise explored, yet once again there was no definitive link. Others theorized that EL was caused by an autoimmune condition or streptococcal infection, but the disease’s true origins still haven’t been discovered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental and societal factors such as &lt;a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/albert-kahn-ww1-photographs" target="_blank"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, crowded living spaces, and global travel may have facilitated the spread of the disease, but these factors still would have only influenced the likeliness of infection rather than revealed the actual origin of encephalitis lethargica. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Uncovering The Mysterious “Sleeping Sickness”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_539249" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-539249" src="https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/constantin-von-economo.jpg" alt="Constantin Von Economo" class="size-full wp-image-539249 post-img-portrait" srcset="https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/constantin-von-economo.jpg 700w, https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/constantin-von-economo-202x300.jpg 202w, https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/constantin-von-economo-606x900.jpg 606w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-539249" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Public Domain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption-body"&gt;Constantin von Economo, the man who identified EL. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Constantin von Economo of the Psychiatric-Neurological Clinic of the University of Vienna examined patients in late 1916 who had been presenting odd neurological symptoms. According to &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/140/8/2246/3970828" target="_blank"&gt;an &lt;em&gt;Oxford Academic&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; by Leslie A. Hoffman and Joel A. Vilensky, those patients had been admitted with diagnoses ranging from meningitis to multiple sclerosis to delirium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, none of the diagnoses truly aligned with any known diagnostic scheme — and the presence of notable lethargy among each patient suggested a common affliction that didn’t seem to fit a known illness. Von Economo believed that this required the description of a new disease, which he outlined in a 1917 manuscript titled &lt;em&gt;Encephalitis Lethargica&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another physician, Jean-René Cruchet, had been treating similar cases in France in a military hospital and published his own description of the disease around the same time as von Economo. Researchers eventually found that EL presented itself in two phases, one acute and one chronic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researcher Paul Foley summarized the stages (and added a third stage) in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/a-viral-infection-of-the-mind-the-curious-case-of-encephalitis-lethargica-660" target="_blank"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, explaining that in the first phase, patients experienced general unease, double vision, extreme drowsiness, and sometimes a fever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The second phase was marked by a general loss of concentration and interest in life, giving a vague sensation that the patient was not the person they had once been,” Foley wrote. “But this period, which resembled chronic fatigue syndrome, was the calm before the storm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_539250" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-539250" src="https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/die-encephalitis-lethargica-illustration.jpg" alt="Encephalitis Lethargica Illustration" class="size-full wp-image-539250 post-img-landscape" srcset="https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/die-encephalitis-lethargica-illustration.jpg 614w, https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/die-encephalitis-lethargica-illustration-300x274.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px"&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-539250" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Public Domain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption-body"&gt;An illustration by Constantin von Economo, showing the brain tissue of a monkey with encephalitis lethargica. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some time — which could have been anywhere between a few days and decades — some patients developed post-encephalitic parkinsonism (PEP), a potential third phase of the disease. It was an irreversible condition that effectively disabled sufferers for the rest of their lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some patients contracted encephalitis lethargica as children. If they were infected between ages 5 and 10, they might eventually experience “pathologic changes of character that approached the psychopathic.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, this may have looked somewhat like attention deficit disorders: restlessness, an inability to focus, clinginess, and so on. But as these children grew older, their impulsive behaviors could potentially lead to violent outbursts that posed a serious threat to themselves and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Errant behaviours included cruelty to anyone who crossed them; destructiveness; lying; and self-mutilation including, in one example, removal of eyes,” Paul Foley explained. “When they reached adolescence, these patients manifested inappropriate and excessive sexuality, including sexual assault without regard for age or gender.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More curiously, these dangerous behaviors were seemingly done purely out of impulse rather than selfishness. Patients often showed genuine remorse for what they had done and said that they had simply felt compelled to behave in the way they did. Unfortunately, some of them continued to let that impulse drive them well into adulthood, only to eventually fall victim to the Parkinsonism that put them in the statue-like state that came to characterize the most severe forms of encephalitis lethargica. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, these severely affected patients lost all willpower and sense of emotional connection. Music no longer moved them, even if they could recognize a musician’s skill. Despite some feeling empathy, they could no longer properly express sympathy. Their minds remained active, but they were incapable of normally interacting with the world as they once had. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while, it may have seemed like countless people would be doomed to suffer this terrible fate. But then, as suddenly as it had swept across the globe, encephalitis lethargica started to vanish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Happened To Encephalitis Lethargica?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_539242" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-539242" src="https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aj-hall-epidemic-encephalitis.jpg" alt="Woman Suffering From Encephalitis Lethargica" class="size-full wp-image-539242 post-img-portrait" srcset="https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aj-hall-epidemic-encephalitis.jpg 800w, https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aj-hall-epidemic-encephalitis-241x300.jpg 241w, https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aj-hall-epidemic-encephalitis-724x900.jpg 724w, https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aj-hall-epidemic-encephalitis-768x955.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-539242" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Public Domain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption-body"&gt;A woman suffering from EL is stuck holding her arms in the air.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EL epidemic reached its peaks during the early 1920s, but by 1927, cases had started to dwindle. According to the &lt;em&gt;Oxford Academic&lt;/em&gt; article, a report in 1929 listed around 80 treatments for EL that had been attempted during the epidemic, none of which proved to be particularly effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that specific report, one-third of patients who contracted EL died during the acute phase, one-third survived without any further complications, and the final third fell victim to later neurological decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since 1940, there have only been around 80 published reports of EL worldwide. There have been some mild successes in treatments — namely with the Parkinson’s medication Levodopa (or L-DOPA), which was mentioned in British neurologist Oliver Sacks’ famous book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Revenirea_la_viata/Zu_UEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=1&amp;amp;pg=PT6&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover" target="_blank"&gt;Awakenings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The book later inspired a 1990 movie starring Robert De Niro as a patient recovering from the effects of the disease after decades of being in a shut-down state and &lt;a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/robin-williams-death" target="_blank"&gt;Robin Williams&lt;/a&gt; as the doctor who was helping him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sacks described the most severely affected EL patients as “extinct volcanoes” that “erupted into life” thanks to L-DOPA, but it turned out that his celebration was presumptuous. What actually happened was that L-DOPA only managed to help EL patients for a period of several months, after which they experienced adverse effects like tics and emotional instability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, some doctors have suggested that electroconvulsive therapy could prove effective for some patients, but with limited data to go on and mixed results, it can’t be said to be a cure. Even now, more than a century after it first emerged, there is no cure for encephalitis lethargica. Nor can anyone explain why the disease appeared and faded away like it did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this day, the EL epidemic remains one of the biggest medical mysteries of the 20th century. And some fear it could possibly return someday.&lt;/p&gt;

It was not immediately clear how the juvenile got measles, and whether the person had traveled. The health department also didn’t say what age range the juvenile was in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;If not immune, people exposed to measles could develop symptoms between May 17 and June 2, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Measles symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose, a rash that usually starts on the face and moves to chest and back, and red watery eyes, according to the health department. The highly contagious respiratory illness can be&lt;a href="https://health.alaska.gov/en/education/measles/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; dangerous or fatal&lt;/a&gt;, especially for babies or children, but the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine provides effective immunity, according to state health officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Most children in Alaska are &lt;a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2025/01/17/state-confirms-measles-case-in-alaskan-who-traveled-overseas/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;vaccinated against measles&lt;/a&gt;: As of the end of last year, about 79% of Alaska kids between 19 and 35 months old had gotten one dose of the MMR vaccine, and 83% of kids between 5 and 18 years old had received a second dose, according to the state’s immunization program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;This year, the United States has seen more than 1,000 cases of measles and three deaths, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#:~:text=Why%20are%20some%20fully%20vaccinated,have%20seen%20in%20previous%20years." target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, including large outbreaks in Texas and New Mexico.

			&lt;p&gt;Humans are not yet done cooking. We're continuing to evolve and adjust to the world around us, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/legendary-female-free-divers-reveal-evolution-in-action-on-south-korean-island"&gt;records of our adaptations written in our bodies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that there are some environments that can make us unwell. Mountain climbers often succumb to &lt;a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/altitude-sickness"&gt;altitude sickness&lt;/a&gt; – the body's reaction to a significant drop in atmospheric pressure, which means less oxygen is taken in with each breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, in high altitudes on the Tibetan Plateau, where oxygen levels in the air people breathe are notably lower than lower altitudes, human communities thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the more than 10,000 years the region has been settled, the bodies of those living there have changed in ways that allow the inhabitants to make the most of an atmosphere that for most humans would result in not enough oxygen being delivered via blood cells to the body's tissues, a condition known as hypoxia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GV5m1wNCJRg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia is fascinating because the stress is severe, experienced equally by everyone at a given altitude, and quantifiable," anthropologist Cynthia Beall of Case Western Reserve University in the US told ScienceAlert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is a beautiful example of how and why our species has so much biological variation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beall has been studying the human response to hypoxic living conditions &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0701985104"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt;. In research published in October 2024, she and her team unveiled some of the specific adaptations in Tibetan communities: traits that help the blood deliver oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To unlock this discovery, the researchers delved into one of the markers of what we call evolutionary fitness: reproductive success. Women who deliver live babies are those who pass on their traits to the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traits that maximize an individual's success in a given environment are most likely to be found in women who are able to survive the stresses of pregnancy and childbirth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141134" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141134" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/lo-monthang.jpg" alt="We're Watching Humans Evolve Right Before Our Very Eyes on The Tibetan Plateau" class="size-full wp-image-141134" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/lo-monthang.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/lo-monthang-553x415.jpg 553w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/lo-monthang-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141134" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Lo Manthang in Nepal, where some of the data was collected. (&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1061935"&gt;James J. Yu&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These women are more likely to give birth to more babies; and those babies, having inherited survivability traits from their mothers, are also more likely to survive to adulthood, and pass the traits on to the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's natural selection at work, and it can be a bit strange and counterintuitive; in places where  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/malaria" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73073" data-postid="162437" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt; is common, for example, the incidence of sickle cell anemia is high, because it &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(11)00384-9"&gt;involves a gene that protects against malaria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beall and her team made a study of 417 women between the ages of 46 and 86 years who have lived all their lives in Nepal above altitudes of around 3,500 meters (11,480 feet). The researchers recorded the number of live births, ranging between 0 and 14 per woman for an average of 5.2, as well as health and physical information and measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the things they measured were levels of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"&gt;hemoglobin&lt;/a&gt;, the protein in red blood cells responsible for delivering oxygen to tissues. They also measured how much oxygen was being carried by the hemoglobin. Interestingly, the women who demonstrated the highest rate of live births had hemoglobin levels that were neither high nor low, but average for the testing group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the oxygen saturation of the hemoglobin was high. Together, the results suggest that the adaptations are able to maximize oxygen delivery to cells and tissues without thickening the blood – a result that would place more stress on the heart as it struggles to pump a higher viscosity fluid more resistant to flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141135" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141135" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/hemoglobin.jpg" alt="We're Watching Humans Evolve Right Before Our Very Eyes on The Tibetan Plateau" class="size-full wp-image-141135" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/hemoglobin.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/hemoglobin-552x415.jpg 552w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/hemoglobin-600x451.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141135" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The noninvasive measurement of hemoglobin concentration and oxygen saturation. (&lt;a href="https://thedaily.case.edu/evolution-in-action-how-ethnic-tibetan-women-thrive-in-thin-oxygen-at-high-altitudes/"&gt;Sienna R. Craig&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Previously we knew that lower hemoglobin was beneficial, now we understand that an intermediate value has the highest benefit. We knew that higher oxygen saturation of hemoglobin was beneficial, now we understand that the higher the saturation the more beneficial. The number of live births quantifies the benefits," Beall said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It was unexpected to find that women can have many live births with low values of some oxygen transport traits if they have favorable values of other oxygen transport traits."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women with the highest reproductive success rate also had a high rate of blood flow into the lungs, and their hearts had wider than average left ventricles, the chamber of the heart responsible for pumping oxygenated blood into the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken all together, these traits increase the rate of oxygen transport and delivery, enabling the human body to make the most of the low oxygen in the air respired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that cultural factors can play a role, too. Women who start reproducing young and have long marriages seem to have a longer exposure to the possibility of pregnancy, which also increases the number of live births, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even taking that into account, however, the physical traits played a role. Nepalese women with physiologies most similar to women in unstressed, low altitude environments tended to have the highest rate of reproductive success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a case of ongoing natural selection," &lt;a href="https://thedaily.case.edu/evolution-in-action-how-ethnic-tibetan-women-thrive-in-thin-oxygen-at-high-altitudes/"&gt;Beall said&lt;/a&gt;. "Understanding how populations like these adapt gives us a better grasp of the processes of human evolution."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2403309121"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in October 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alarmingly, more and more adolescents are being diagnosed with depression, and when it starts early, the effects can be long-lasting and severe,” said senior author Cecilia Flores, James McGill Professor in McGill’s Department of Psychiatry, a researcher at the Douglas Research Centre and a principal investigator at the Ludmer Centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Teens with depression are more likely to struggle with substance use, social isolation and experience symptoms that often don’t respond well to treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the nine molecules – known as microRNAs – have not been linked to adult depression, suggesting they reflect biological processes unique to teens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A minimally invasive and scalable approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, conducted in collaboration with colleagues at the University of California, Los Angeles and Stanford University, focused on 62 teenagers: 34 with depression and 28 without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers collected small volumes of blood samples, let them dry, and then froze the samples to preserve molecular integrity over time. Such samples are taken with a simple finger prick and are easy to store and transport, making the approach practical and scalable for broader use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The McGill team developed the lab method used to extract and analyze microRNAs from the samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings pave the way for using dried blood spots as a practical tool in psychiatric research, allowing us to track early biological changes linked to mental health using a minimally invasive method,” said first author Alice Morgunova, postdoctoral fellow at McGill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosing depression mostly relies on self-reported symptoms. The authors say this could delay care, especially if teens don’t recognize the signs or aren’t ready to talk about them. A blood-based screening tool could provide an additional and more objective metric to identify teens at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers plan to validate their findings in larger groups of adolescents and to study how these microRNAs interact with genetic and environmental risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Peripheral microRNA signatures in adolescent depression” by Alice Morgunova and Cecilia Flores et al., was published in &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry Global Open Science.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was funded by the Douglas Foundation and Bombardier Fund grant, the National Institute on Drug Abuse of NIH, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, a Healthy Brains for Healthy Lives Graduate Student Fellowship, an Integrated Program in Neuroscience Internal Award, and Postdoctoral Fellowship from the McGill-Douglas Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry International Collaborative Initiative in Adversity and Mental Health, an international partnership funded by the Canada First Research Excellence Fund, awarded to McGill University for the Healthy Brains for Healthy Lives initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this depression and genetics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4b202e22272a652f2e3b2a3b2e0b26282c22272765282a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Keila DePape&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mcgill.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;McGill University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Keila DePape – McGill University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsgos.2025.100505" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Peripheral microRNA signatures in adolescent depression&lt;/a&gt;” by Cecilia Flores et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry Global Open Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peripheral microRNA signatures in adolescent depression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0015"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adolescent depression is linked to enduring maladaptive outcomes, chronic severity of symptoms, and poor treatment response. Identifying epigenetic signatures of adolescent depression is urgently needed to improve early prevention and intervention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MicroRNAs are epigenetic regulators of adolescent neurodevelopmental processes, but their role as markers and mediators of adolescent depression is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0020"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we examined microRNA profiles from dried blood spot samples of clinically depressed and psychiatrically healthy male and female adolescents. We processed and sequenced these samples using a small RNA protocol tailored for microRNA identification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0025"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified nine differentially expressed (DE) microRNAs (adjusted p-value &amp;lt; 0.05), all of which upregulated in adolescents with depression. At future follow-ups post blood collection, expression of miR-3613-5p, mir-30c-2 and miR-942-5p positively associated with depression severity but not anxiety, suggesting a stronger link to persistent depression symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expression of miR-32-5p correlated inversely with hippocampal volume, highlighting a potential neurobiological basis. Common predicted gene targets of the DE microRNAs are involved in neurodevelopment, cognitive processing, and depressive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0030"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings lay the groundwork for identifying adolescent peripheral microRNA markers that reflect neurodevelopmental pathways shaping lifelong psychopathology risk.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 21:10:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE9QazN6TUIxMXdwMDdfbDhnV3d4YmtPZHFzSVNWTGQ5MlBVeFh2dzJwRWxveGFZNEdWX3VTcmw2OElFZko0WnBzYWVJYkF0UDg5THVYcVluVElyXy1oY2gwQS1WQk1tMUlfUGcxaHpBRQ</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，与酒精有关的癌症死亡人数正在迅速上升- ABC新闻 | Cancer deaths tied to alcohol are rising fast, study finds - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxQQlctNnpOaU93N2t1dmY3ckE3RU9JNnZST3lQNEs2dGRoWTVuU2dwSWkyYm9obFFhdmQ4TjJJUW12MExlOWFpS3lWcmNTM09GdDVZYy1LYmltR2NLd3duWG1QaVNnRDBpWGZWdnRQTlo5ekhBR2h4eUhHejFtQzdKS3diY1pQUDNGSjF1U2E2eTk5M3Y4bVNfbjFxRdIBoAFBVV95cUxOSUdUbkNYVmxMbEhCeFhaemo3cVBDOWl6Z0cxcFE5SFdLeDBQaWpsdldtWlRuSVR4cXMzVkdZcEZ4OWxEdUY1WDl2akxHTTF3X2ZQS2tnemgyMVh5cnhseVJsUU9kcnpmUzF2TGs0Znl2SFpnR1V4NXdxdmFQY29CeUh6b2xXQkN3NldjYVdjX05XQ19pWUo3WXJ6OWtYbWJX?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;Alcohol associated cancer deaths have doubled in the United States over the past three decades, disproportionately impacting men and people 55 and older, according to a new, yet to be published, study being presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual conference this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The analysis of national death rates attributable to alcohol use between 1990 to 2021 found a significant increase from 11,896 to 23,207 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We already know other risk factors, such as tobacco, for cancer," Dr. Chinmay Jani, the study's lead author and a clinical fellow in hematology and oncology at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, told ABC News.

We can treat a lot of cancers, and we’re getting better at that, but this is really driving home the point that people are dying from cancer due to alcohol,” said Jane Figueiredo, a professor of medicine at the Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, who was not involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The study focused on seven alcohol-related cancers: breast, liver, colorectal, throat, voice box, mouth and esophageal. Alcohol isn’t responsible for every case of these cancers, but it has been shown to be a driving factor in a percentage of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“When people think about alcohol, they don’t necessarily think of it as being a carcinogen like they do tobacco,” said Dr. Michael Siegel, a professor of public health and community medicine at the Tufts University School of Medicine, who was not involved with the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But it is. Once in the body, alcohol breaks down into &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/alcohol/alcohol-fact-sheet" target="_blank"&gt;acetaldehyde&lt;/a&gt; — a carcinogen also found in tobacco smoke. Alcohol damages DNA and makes it easier for the mouth and throat to absorb other carcinogens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The International Agency on Cancer Research, a branch of the World Health Organization, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/alcohol/alcohol-fact-sheet" target="_blank"&gt;classified alcohol&lt;/a&gt; as a carcinogen in 1987. Research&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;at that time linked drinking to cancers of the head and neck (including the mouth, throat, voice box and esophagus) and liver cancers. It’s since been linked to breast and colorectal cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A January &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/alcohol-cancer-risk-warning-surgeon-general-report-rcna186095" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from the former U.S. surgeon general said alcoholic drinks should come with cancer warning labels. According to WHO, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news-room/04-01-2023-no-level-of-alcohol-consumption-is-safe-for-our-health" target="_blank"&gt;no safe amount&lt;/a&gt; of alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The new research found that in 1991, 2.5% of all cancer deaths in men and 1.46% in women were related to alcohol. In 2021, those percentages rose to 4.2% and 1.85%, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Over that same time period, men saw a 56% increase in deaths from alcohol-related cancers specifically. For women, it was nearly 8%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It was not surprising that it was higher in men, but it was certainly surprising how much higher it was in men versus women,” said study co-leader Dr. Chinmay Jani, chief fellow of hematology and oncology at the University of Miami’s Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. Historically, men have tended to start drinking alcohol earlier in life, Jani and his team noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, sex-based drinking habits appear to be shifting. In recent years, an increasing number of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/women-us-are-drinking-death-research-finds-rcna96848" target="_blank"&gt;women have become heavy drinkers&lt;/a&gt;, and slightly more young women binge drink than men, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2832889?guestAccessKey=d47ec1d7-0eea-48ee-a6ad-a9356c6b5f85&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=041625" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Deaths from the seven alcohol-related cancers increased among men in 47 states, and in 16 states for women. In both groups, deaths among people living in New Mexico rose the most — nearly 60% for men and 18% for women. Oklahoma, for men, and Tennessee, for women, came in close second. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Washington D.C. and New York saw the biggest decreases for men, and Massachusetts and New York for women. Utah remained the state with the lowest alcohol-related cancer deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Cancer deaths were highest among people 55 and older. In men in this age group, alcohol-related cancer deaths rose by more than 1% every year between 2007 and 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The carcinogenic effect probably isn’t affecting you right away in your younger age, but as you continue to drink as you age, this carcinogen has an accumulative effect on the body,” Jani said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Of all seven alcohol-related cancers, liver, colorectal and esophageal cancers were the deadliest overall in 2021. In men specifically, liver cancer deaths were most common. For women, it was breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We know that even small amounts of alcohol can affect the breast tissue,” Figueiredo said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Jani said the next phase of research should tease out how different racial and ethnic groups are affected by alcohol differently when it comes to cancer risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The enzyme that metabolizes alcohol is lower in some ethnic groups than others, so acetaldehyde, the carcinogen in alcohol, is higher in these people,” Jani said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Alcohol consumption in the U.S. hit its peak in the late 1970s and dropped until the late ‘90s, data from the &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/surveillance-reports/surveillance120" target="_blank"&gt;National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism&lt;/a&gt; show. Drinking also rose sharply during the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/alcohol-deaths-spiked-middle-aged-adults-especially-women-pandemic-rcna55419" target="_blank"&gt;as did alcohol-related deaths&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Siegel said messaging around alcohol needs to shift from drinking responsibly to making sure people understand the health effects that even moderate drinking can pose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“It’s not that we’re telling people they can’t drink. Every person has the autonomy to make their own decisions,” Siegel said. “But we want to make sure they are well-informed based on the facts rather than misconceptions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxQUkFxdENaN0NDRW1NT3hMV1JzSTBTT29TbjJRNGZ1QlUwTV9UUktZQU5sSjczclNWMVp4bXZycVNXMERaSkRhMllFeVliaUticW14RGFQbGJ6Z3oyR2hWaC1tT2tCcVNkRl9sZUtkaFRyQ1lVUnZyQ3FpeGdCQjd0d0FoSFJjVFR3YXpOa0t30gFWQVVfeXFMTXVoczdPdVhkZ3BMT2FUaUlnREJiQ1QtclU0cE5ZemctQ0w5Qlk4V1NKMVMxRk1oTEpOb2tneTRfMGtjZWxxTG9YZlU2WnkxaHIxcl9PNHc</guid></item><item><title>新的研究表明，维生素D可能会减缓与衰老相关的过程-《华盛顿邮报》 | Vitamin D may slow a process related to aging, new study suggests - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxNS3dReThmRFBEcTRvelhTZ0tGNUowT0lxdHE3SUdCM2VBWEV2b2JETjFHVzcxMnpoMFlvRlR6b2ZMNHRXSkVsQlhnNzB6QTZ0UkNwZnVULTZ3Y0hDaWJrd01jYmdOTkYzaHdzblZ0S2FXdHQ5QlU3SnlWTTJuTkJhWmtabnl2djI3eXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="I77BVWH4TVF7NJREDLXXTEVQVI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;People who have a higher vitamin D intake may be slowing down a biological process linked to aging, according to &lt;a href="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(25)00255-2/abstract"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; published this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="H5SY23A24BBDBE7IFLRCVRLBCQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But don’t rush out to buy supplements just yet. The findings need to be confirmed with additional research, and the vast majority of people in the United States are already &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/09/12/vitamin-d-supplement-deficiency-covid/"&gt;getting enough vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; from diet and sunlight, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RVX4X7J6YZELDOYNPF5X32IPJU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the new analysis, researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and other universities looked at telomeres — the protective caps of DNA code at the ends of chromosomes — which tend to shorten as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3GERJYXPHRGOVBHJJI766IVKG4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s a biological “clock” of sorts, and shorter telomeres have been linked to an increased risk of certain diseases. Vitamin D supplements, though, may slow that shrinking process, the new research, published in the &lt;a href="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(25)00255-2/fulltext"&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7BH5A5GKNVAT7CIJ3GD2LJ6DAY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While previous studies have shown an association between vitamin D and telomere length, most were observational.

It involves 25,871 participants — U.S. women age 55 and older and men age 50 and older — who have been given 2,000 IUs of vitamin D3 a day and 1 gram of Omega 3 fatty acid a day to determine their effects primarily on cancer and cardiovascular disease prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DUSRLXLG4FHQNG2JHP2QRWV3V4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The telomere study focused on about 900 of those participants, largely from Boston, whose telomere length in white blood cells was assessed at baseline and again in years 2 and 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JYQUW5W3BVDMPJX6IDZNJTDEOI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers found that compared with the group taking the placebo, those taking vitamin D supplements had reduced telomere shortening over four years. Omega 3 fatty acid supplementation, on the other hand, had no obvious effect on telomere length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="S4VHXBMF2VDTNEDXL3KBJ4YNRA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="S4VHXBMF2VDTNEDXL3KBJ4YNRA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How telomeres may be associated with aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ISVJKZN2M5DU5H3ZC35TR24YMQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;During each cell division, telomeres ensure that the cell’s chromosomes do not fuse with one another or rearrange themselves, and with each replication, the telomeres shorten a bit. This process is associated with aging as well as an increased risk of infections, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MXSVZOCGP5DYPJJTRKBJSX32EU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The researchers think that vitamin D supplementation’s benefit is related to tamping down inflammation, Manson said. Inflammation has been associated with autoimmune diseases as well as cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="ZX73D7LDNFHKVGMWNMTY4JNXLU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="ZX73D7LDNFHKVGMWNMTY4JNXLU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Healthy diet and lifestyle are critical&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UQQQGUHTMZFDXDBB3DADTJ72TM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While vitamin D may have benefits, Manson emphasized that it is not a cure-all. There are many chronic diseases that do not seem to be reduced by vitamin D supplementation, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7265VQYKSZBCDH44R3MODZUKXI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Dietary supplements will never be a substitute for healthy diet and healthy lifestyle, and we've made it very clear time and again that the focus should be on the diet and lifestyle rather than on supplementation,” she said. “However, targeted supplementation for people who have higher levels of inflammation or a higher risk of chronic diseases clearly related to inflammation, those high risk groups may benefit from targeted vitamin D supplementation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C2Y6A47X7ZD73AEPKLG5LZXGTQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The telomere study was randomized, meaning participants were randomly assigned to either the vitamin D supplement group or the placebo group to ensure that characteristics such as age, health status, diet and lifestyle are balanced between the groups. Randomization is considered the gold standard in clinical research because it makes the groups as similar as possible at the start of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="E26MIEAO6JDLBM5PUXMVD5JEUA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“All of the risk factors for chronic disease, for telomere shortening, the age, the demographics, the physical activity, diet, underlying health, hypertension, diabetes, all these risk factors are balanced out by the randomization process,” Manson said, meaning the only difference between the two groups was that one received vitamin D and one did not. And the study was also “double-blinded,” meaning that not only did the participants in each group not know which was receiving the supplement, but neither did the technicians administering it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="NRK27DIADJEEVH3YNQRLR36APU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="NRK27DIADJEEVH3YNQRLR36APU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What other research and experts say&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DWHE56MJ55HGZOMMY6ZCWJPJBU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Not all studies have been as promising with regard to telomere preservation. A paper published in 2023 in the Journal of Nutrition, Health and Aging, for instance, concluded that “routinely supplementing older adults, who are largely vitamin D replete, with monthly doses of vitamin D is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1279770723002312"&gt;unlikely to influence telomere length&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NLOM6FBBRNFEVEUGQWOT2LKTXU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Between 2014 and 2020, researchers at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute in Brisbane, Australia, led a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 1,519 participants, to see whether vitamin D supplementation would affect telomere length.

       in the state — two each in Cass and Williams counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All four of the cases are in unvaccinated people.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;Cass County, home to Fargo and West Fargo, has four cases of the disease, and Williams County, home to Williston, has 13. No other counties in the state have reported measles infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those infected, one person is under 5 years old, 12 are between age 5 and 19, and 4 are 20 or older, according to Health and Human Services data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One person in Cass County has been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious, viral illness that can be fatal, particularly for young children and those with compromised immune systems. Measles spreads through the air and can remain in a room and on surfaces for up to two hours, sometimes even traveling between floors through ventilation systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms often include a fever, cough, runny nose or eye irritation followed by a body-wide rash. There is no specific medical treatment for measles.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;According to the state health department, most North Dakotans are vaccinated against measles, and the risk to the general public is low. People who were vaccinated as children and 
    
      &lt;a class="Link " href="https://www.inforum.com/health/some-adults-may-only-have-1-measles-vaccine-dose-others-may-have-no-protection-doctors-say" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;adults born before 1957&lt;/a&gt;
    
       are considered protected due to previous infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The MMR vaccine is 93% effective after one dose and 97% effective after two doses,” Molly Howell, state immunization director, said in a statement. “People who are vaccinated and exposed to measles are not likely to develop the disease. MMR vaccination is critical to preventing the spread of measles in the community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For information about measles, vaccination or local clinic availability, contact the Health and Human Services Immunization Unit at

                Our newsroom occasionally reports stories under a byline of "staff." Often, the "staff" byline is used when rewriting basic news briefs that originate from official sources, such as a city press release about a road closure, and which require little or no reporting. At times, this byline is used when a news story includes numerous authors or when the story is formed by aggregating previously reported news from various sources. If outside sources are used, it is noted within the story.

Ethel Caterham, the world’s oldest living woman at the age of 115, offers a simple yet powerful insight into how she has managed to live such a remarkable life.Born in 1909, Ethel has witnessed immense global changes—from world wars to technological revolutions—and through it all, she has maintained a philosophy that has kept her peaceful, healthy, and vibrant. Her secret? One straightforward rule that she believes has helped her live over a century: “Never argue with anyone. I listen and I do what I like.” This rule, rooted in calmness and self-respect, reveals much about the connection between emotional well-being and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One rule the 115-year-old world’s oldest woman lives by every day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about her secret to living beyond a century, Ethel’s answer was refreshingly simple: avoiding arguments and listening more. She said, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;“Never argue with anyone. I listen and I do what I like.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; This philosophy centers on emotional calmness and self-control, avoiding unnecessary conflicts that can drain energy and increase stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific research confirms the wisdom in Ethel’s words. Chronic stress and emotional turmoil are linked to an increased risk of heart disease, weakened immune function, and accelerated aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By choosing to avoid arguments, Ethel likely protected her body and mind from these harmful effects, creating an environment where health and happiness could flourish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ethel Caterham’s early life and formative experiences&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethel Caterham was born on August 21, 1909, in the village of Shipton Bellinger, England. Growing up as the second youngest in a family of eight siblings, her early years were shaped by simplicity and traditional values. Life at that time was markedly different — horse-drawn carriages, handwritten letters, and a world on the brink of World War I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the many historical upheavals she experienced, Ethel maintained a steady and calm disposition throughout her life. This ability to remain composed and adaptable was a foundation that supported her health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How emotional well-being impacts longevity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emotional health is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in overall longevity. Studies show that people who manage their emotions well and maintain stable, positive relationships tend to live longer and healthier lives. Chronic emotional conflict can lead to inflammation in the body, which is associated with many age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethel’s ability to listen and remain composed reflects an emotional resilience that scientific studies link to longevity. By conserving her energy for positive experiences rather than arguments, she helped her body maintain a healthier internal balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A life rich with experience and travel&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethel’s long life was also marked by boldness and curiosity. At 18, she traveled to India to work as a nanny, embracing new cultures and challenges. Later, she lived in Hong Kong and Gibraltar with her husband, a British army major. These experiences likely enriched her life and kept her mentally engaged, another important factor linked to healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite frequent moves and changes, Ethel’s calm demeanor never wavered. She raised two daughters in the UK and continued to live with strength and grace, even after the loss of her husband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;115 years of life, love, and calm: What Ethel teaches us about longevity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethel recently celebrated her 115th birthday surrounded by friends, family, and caregivers. Beyond the impressive number, her story is a reminder that longevity is about quality as much as quantity. Her life teaches us that peace of mind, emotional balance, and simple joy can be the most effective ingredients for a long life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Practical lessons From Ethel Caterham’s rule for long life&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we cannot all control our genetics or the eras we live through, Ethel’s simple rule offers actionable wisdom:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid unnecessary conflict&lt;/strong&gt;: Focus on listening and understanding rather than arguing, which can reduce stress and promote emotional health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do what you like&lt;/strong&gt;: Prioritise your happiness and well-being, embracing personal autonomy and enjoyment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay curious&lt;/strong&gt;: Embrace new experiences and cultures to keep your mind active and engaged.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice emotional resilience&lt;/strong&gt;: Develop habits that support calmness and mental clarity, such as mindfulness and deep breathing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Supporting healthy longevity with modern science&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethel’s philosophy aligns with scientific recommendations for longevity, which emphasize emotional health alongside physical health. Regular exercise, hydration, stress management, a balanced diet, and strong social connections are all essential. Emotional calmness and happiness have been shown to enhance immune function, reduce the risk of chronic disease, and improve overall life satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 18:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi6wFBVV95cUxOY3UxSmNlWDlzTkZfVGtoUFg2enJSelNtVjN4UlJJaW5GY3hRUEk1S1VxSDRSTXlna3RnbE0wRXVtWFp4RklFUTAzVEg4Mnlfa1g4a04xUVA3UnV2djZpVmlIVXBEa2o5dkxVVGtFLTBmQnpYREFUWWZIQmFSdFpDMUlQc1JrdFpORU01elZuV1lUUGdaNEd6RXdmQ3k2NlkxXy03S25NUDNxTl9aWDhHTWVHRFVHbGFpZkZpVDhFRGZodG9XeWVVQk1lZzhITTd4WTZWaXhOZGtVT2pmTlloRXlyaTRjazVocHpz</guid></item><item><title>肠道细菌可以影响大脑蛋白质如何被碳水化合物修饰- PsyPost | Gut bacteria can influence how brain proteins are modified by carbohydrates - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxQLWZkQ05ZTnAzREdoWHRzUTdGNUxTYTFERHQ5d1ZZUFBZcUJ5WEVoNzFITzUyVkVmcXMtX3NxelVmNTdNdHk5RlRaRHNPb1VLWVR5b3hHY3kxeE9QNE93NWlJX09kbHM1Ukk2aGlIXzV6ZTFwWVZWNmN5Z3dpYVR5dkF4dzc0dDlaRjRUcTJqenpaWGp0bmZEdFJxbVpGa2hyZ3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-025-01485-w" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Structural and Molecular Biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; offers groundbreaking evidence that gut bacteria can influence how proteins in the brain are chemically modified by sugars, a process known as glycosylation. Using a new method called DQGlyco, the researchers were able to analyze brain glycosylation with unprecedented resolution, revealing that different microbial populations in the gut can alter these patterns in ways that may affect brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein glycosylation is a biological process in which sugar molecules are added to proteins, helping regulate how proteins function, interact, and communicate within and between cells. While this process plays important roles in many systems of the body, its involvement in the brain has been difficult to study due to the complexity and diversity of sugar modifications. Past studies have also been limited by technical constraints in identifying and quantifying the many forms of glycosylation that can occur on a single protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome these challenges, researchers developed a method called deep quantitative glycoprofiling, or DQGlyco. This new technique allows scientists to measure protein glycosylation at a scale and resolution not previously possible. The team then used DQGlyco to examine how glycosylation patterns in the mouse brain are affected by different gut microbiomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study began by validating the DQGlyco method in both human cells and mouse brain tissue. This method combines improved sample preparation, high-sensitivity detection, and precise labeling techniques to isolate and analyze glycopeptides—protein fragments with attached sugar chains. The researchers applied their method to brain tissue from mice, identifying over 177,000 unique glycopeptides. This is more than 25 times the number identified in previous studies, offering an unprecedented view of the brain glycoproteome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this enhanced dataset, the researchers discovered widespread “microheterogeneity”—meaning that individual sites on a protein often carried many different sugar forms, known as glycoforms. On average, they found about 17 glycoforms per site, and in some cases, more than 600 different glycoforms at a single location. This variation was not random. Sites with greater microheterogeneity were more likely to be located in structured and accessible parts of the protein, suggesting that structural features help determine how extensively proteins are glycosylated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed that certain types of glycosylation—such as those involving specific sugar types like fucose or sialic acid—were more common on particular protein domains, such as those involved in immune signaling or cell adhesion. These findings suggest that the chemical diversity of sugar modifications may be functionally relevant, influencing how proteins interact and perform their roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore the influence of the gut microbiome on brain glycosylation, the team conducted experiments using germ-free mice. These mice were either kept sterile or colonized with different bacterial populations, including a single common gut species or a defined community of eight bacteria. Two weeks later, the researchers analyzed the mice’s brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed substantial differences in glycosylation patterns between the groups. Over 2,500 glycopeptides in the brain were affected by the presence or absence of gut microbes. These changes were especially prominent on proteins known to be involved in neurotransmission, such as glutamate receptors and ion channels. Many of the altered glycoforms were located at sites with high microheterogeneity, indicating that microbial signals might be influencing the most dynamically glycosylated regions of brain proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, only a small number of changes in protein abundance were observed, suggesting that the differences were not due to changes in how much protein was produced, but rather in how those proteins were modified after being made. Additional experiments showed that glycosylation changes were also associated with differences in protein solubility and thermal stability, two indicators of changes in protein function or localization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that certain glycoforms were more likely to be surface-exposed on cells, using enzymes to selectively cleave sugars or proteins from intact cells. Surface-exposed glycoforms tended to be more complex and processed, whereas high-mannose forms—often considered immature—were less accessible. This helped distinguish between proteins that were still being processed inside cells versus those functioning at the cell surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining deep profiling with structural predictions from AlphaFold, the researchers created a model that could predict whether a given glycosylation site was likely to be highly variable or not. This model, based on structural exposure and folding, successfully distinguished between high and low microheterogeneity sites and suggested that glycosylation patterns are influenced by the 3D structure of proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings open new directions for understanding the gut-brain axis, the study has several limitations. The experiments were conducted in mice, so it is not yet clear how directly the results apply to humans. The study also measured glycosylation patterns at a specific time point, meaning that the dynamic nature of these changes over longer periods remains unknown. Additionally, although changes in glycosylation were linked to structural and biophysical changes in proteins, the functional consequences for behavior or brain activity were not directly tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research may explore how these glycosylation changes influence neural development, cognition, or disease risk. The authors also suggest that their DQGlyco method could be applied to human tissue or disease models to identify glycosylation signatures linked to neurological or psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-025-01485-w" target="_blank"&gt;Uncovering protein glycosylation dynamics and heterogeneity using deep quantitative glycoprofiling (DQGlyco)&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Clément M.

				&lt;p&gt;Five travel-associated cases of Legionnaires’ disease are being investigated by the Southern Nevada Health District, the agency announced Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two are at the South Point, and three others are at the neighboring Grandview at Las Vegas, the agency said in a release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At South Point, one person stayed at the property in August, while the other stayed in February. Both individuals have since recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At The Grandview, one person stayed at the property in February, while the other two stayed in April. All three were hospitalized; two have since recovered, and one remains hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following notification of cases, the Health District conducted environmental water sampling at the facilities. Multiple water samples tested positive for Legionella, the bacteria that can cause Legionnaires’ disease, the release said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legionnaires’ disease symptoms typically begin within two to 10 days after exposure to the bacteria. However, people should watch for symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, fever, muscle aches and headaches for up to two weeks after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guests who stayed at the South Point on or after April 16 and who developed or are experiencing symptoms within 14 days of their stay are urged to &lt;a href="https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/8326801/South-Point-Legionella-Investigation" target="_blank"&gt;complete a confidential illness survey here&lt;/a&gt;. Guests who stayed at The Grandview on or after March 27 and who developed or are experiencing symptoms within 14 days of their stay are urged to &lt;a href="https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/8323167/Grandview-Legionella-Investigation" target="_blank"&gt;complete a confidential illness survey here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If guests are currently still symptomatic, they should seek medical attention and alert their medical provider of the potential exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a developing story. Check back for updates.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, often says that when his uncle was president in the early 1960s, Americans were much healthier than they are now. People were thinner and had lower rates of chronic disease, he recalls. Fewer children had autism, allergies or autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;On Thursday, the Trump administration &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/kennedy-trump-maha-report.html" title=""&gt;released a report on children’s health&lt;/a&gt; premised on the idea that we’ve fallen far since this golden era. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But were Americans really healthier back then?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The U.S. population was much younger in the 1960s, at the tail end of the Baby Boom, which complicates comparisons. Only 12.4 percent of the population was 65 or older in 1963, compared with 17.7 percent now. Rates of chronic diseases generally increase with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But Americans must be doing something right: Life expectancy has increased. A child born today can expect to live almost a decade longer than a child born in 1960. That’s partly because advances in medical care mean that conditions that were deadly decades ago can be kept in check for longer now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“If R.F.K. Jr. makes the statement that more people are dying of chronic diseases now than in Jack Kennedy’s era, that’s undoubtedly true — we’ve got twice as many people, and a much larger chunk are old folks who have much higher chronic disease rates,” said Kenneth Warner, dean emeritus of the University of Michigan School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Does that mean we’re doing worse than back then?” he added. “Absolutely not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Americans have put on the pounds over the decades, as Mr. Kennedy often notes. Diabetes and obesity are on the rise even among adolescents. On the other hand, the country has cut back dramatically on smoking, a habit that once contributed to huge numbers of deaths in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

The longer someone used antidepressants, the more severe and prolonged the symptoms became, with 64% of long-term users reporting moderate or severe withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, short-term users—those taking the medication for less than six months—mostly experienced no or only mild symptoms, with few lasting beyond four weeks. These findings highlight the importance of careful prescribing and support the need for informed, gradual tapering strategies to help individuals discontinue antidepressants safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Long-term use (over 2 years) increases the odds of withdrawal symptoms tenfold compared to use under six months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severity &amp;amp; Persistence:&lt;/strong&gt; 25% of long-term users reported severe symptoms; 12% experienced symptoms lasting over a year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short-Term Advantage:&lt;/strong&gt; Most short-term users saw symptoms resolve within four weeks, with only 7% reporting severe effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who have been taking antidepressants for more than two years are substantially more likely to experience withdrawal symptoms compared to short-term users when they come off the medication, finds a new study led by UCL researchers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term users also tend to experience worse withdrawal symptoms, and for a longer period of time, than short-term users, and are less likely to be able to stop taking the drug when they attempt to do so, according to the findings published in &lt;em&gt;Psychiatry Research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s lead author Dr Mark Horowitz, visiting clinical researcher at UCL Division of Psychiatry, said: “Our findings confirm what many researchers have long suspected, that the likelihood of experiencing withdrawal symptoms when coming off antidepressants is largely determined by duration of use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While coming off antidepressants can be easier for people who have only taken them for a short period of time, these drugs are commonly used for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Half of those in the UK who take antidepressants have taken the medication for at least a year, and the majority of US antidepressants users have been taking them for over two years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was based on survey responses from 310 participants in England, who had been accessing NHS primary care therapy services, and who had at one point attempted to stop taking their prescribed antidepressant. Most participants – 62% – reported that antidepressants had been helpful to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents were asked about an extensive list of potential withdrawal symptoms, and self-reported whether the symptoms were mild, moderate, or severe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the whole group, 79% reported at least one withdrawal symptom and 45% experienced symptoms they classified as moderate or severe (30% and 15%, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the entire group, 38% said they were unable to stop antidepressants when they tried to do so, rising to 79% among people who had been taking antidepressants for two years or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As some withdrawal symptoms (such as anxiety, worsened mood, agitation and fatigue) overlap with depression and anxiety symptoms and may represent relapse, the researchers also separated those out to find that 76% of respondents experienced at least one non-emotional withdrawal symptom such as dizziness, headache, vertigo, or nausea, while 43% experienced four or more non-emotional symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In analysis conducted by researchers in the UCL Division of Psychology &amp;amp; Language Sciences, the team found that how long someone had been on an antidepressant was the major determining factor for incidence, severity, and duration of withdrawal effects, and whether someone was able to stop taking the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The differences between short-term and long-term users were not explained by the severity of the underlying depression or anxiety disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the odds of experiencing any withdrawal effects were 10 times greater for those who had been on antidepressants for more than two years, compared to those who had been taking them for less than six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among people who had been taking antidepressants for two years of more, 64% reported moderate or severe withdrawal effects (25% reported severe effects), while among those who had been taking the medication for six months or less, the majority (73%) reported either no withdrawal effects or only mild symptoms, with only 7% experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For long-term users, 30% reported withdrawal symptoms lasting more than three months, with 12% experiencing such symptoms for more than a year, while only 10.5% of short-term users experienced withdrawal symptoms for more than three months. For most short-term users, withdrawal symptoms resolved in under four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Horowitz said: “This is one reason to use antidepressants for no longer than necessary – because doing so may make it harder to stop using them later on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers say that one limitation of the study is that the survey response rate was less than one in five (18%). Respondents may have been more motivated to answer the survey if they experienced withdrawal symptoms, although the survey was not solely focused on withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the researchers asked whether people had been easing themselves off antidepressants slowly with a tapering technique, or quitting all at once, the results were inconclusive as not enough participants had been tapering for more than four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers say that as other studies have suggested that tapering is beneficial, further research is needed into how best to taper from antidepressants, and how it can mitigate withdrawal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior author Professor Joanna Moncrieff (UCL Division of Psychiatry) said: “Withdrawal symptoms are commonly experienced by people coming off antidepressants, so we would advise that people who want to stop taking the medication should do so in consultation with an informed health professional.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this mental health and psychopharmacology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7e1d160c170d50121f101b3e0b1d12501f1d500b15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chris Lane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucl.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Chris Lane – UCL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2025.116497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Antidepressants withdrawal effects and duration of use: a survey of patients enrolled in primary care psychotherapy services&lt;/a&gt;” by Mark Horowitz et al. &lt;em&gt;Psychiatry Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antidepressants withdrawal effects and duration of use: a survey of patients enrolled in primary care psychotherapy services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cesectitle0003"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies of antidepressant withdrawal have been limited by short duration of drug exposure or self-selected samples. Our study aimed to estimate withdrawal effects in routine clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cesectitle0004"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants from NHS primary care psychological treatment services who had ever tried to stop an antidepressant were surveyed. Regression models were constructed to examine the association between personal and medication characteristics, and withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cesectitle0005"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents(&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 310) were mostly female(78 %), white(75 %), with an average age of 38.79(SD 12.4). The response rate was 18 % of eligible patients. 62 % reported antidepressants had been helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Withdrawal symptoms of some degree were reported by 79 %. 45 % reported severe or moderately severe symptoms. 43 % met the most stringent definition of a withdrawal syndrome, reporting 4 or more ‘non-emotional’ withdrawal symptoms. 38 % of participants reported being unable to stop their antidepressant when they tried to do so. 20 % reported withdrawal symptoms lasting more than three months and 10 % for more than a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fully adjusted models those using antidepressants for over 24-months prior to stopping were more likely to experience a withdrawal syndrome (OR(95 %CI)=10.41(2.88;37.67)), report severe withdrawal effects (OR(95 %CI) = 5.16(2.75;9.70)), report longer lasting symptoms (Beta(95 %CI)=18.11(3.85;32.38), and be less likely to be able to stop (OR(95 %CI)=27.55(10.29;73.81), than those using for less than six-months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cesectitle0006"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antidepressant withdrawal symptoms were common, and severe and prolonged for a substantial proportion of users. Longer duration of use was associated with greater likelihood of severe and protracted symptoms and being less likely to be able to stop. A limitation of this study is the low rate of response.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 16:21:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTFBIdERqM2JlT3A1aUhlRXNneGVvUkd2WFVVajJrcFdNRUtaMW9tYWJQLUdTS3VMSGxINWY5WnN0YzNSTmlEN1RTYVI0WmVfWVFiaTBLSnNQZkJhVDJSVmJJQnRtaXZTYlVPM0k1Yg</guid></item><item><title>研究表明， “虎妈”育儿可以提高青少年的认知技能，但会破坏情绪发展- PsyPost | “Tiger mom” parenting boosts teens' cognitive skills but undermines emotional development, study suggests - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixAFBVV95cUxPTi1YRW9ZUThMaTNSdjhuVF83LWNQQUdjaVUtRjJhdnlfMWQzQUZ5cmVNYUJROW5Fcm1zMHkyZXM5a2lPLTRYMGl6bVpOamhhSmhEU2xqXzJwNER4Y0NnZTRnUHY2V2M3eHdBV0hxZmswdE5DMDZWb09iaG1CSWhlVjdaVmFxSXNmNzF5OWhvdDJ6cV9JNzVMZTYtUlE5dFdiLUxTV1haNjdkNy1FYXNqVDdveXExNTJWTmxKTXRfcU0zT0x0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ehb.2024.101463"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Economics and Human Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that when mothers hold dominant positions in their children’s educational decisions, they are more likely to adopt a “tiger mom” approach. This parenting style is associated with enhanced cognitive performance and academic achievement in adolescents but may hinder the development of non-cognitive skills and reduce investment in leisure time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Tiger moms” are mothers who practice strict, high-expectation parenting styles. The term became widely known through Amy Chua’s 2011 book &lt;em&gt;Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother&lt;/em&gt;. This approach is often associated with East Asian parenting, particularly in Chinese or Chinese-American households.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiger moms emphasize academic excellence, discipline, and obedience. They enforce rigorous study schedules and often restrict recreational activities. Supporters argue that this style fosters work ethic, perseverance, and achievement, while critics warn it may contribute to anxiety, low self-esteem, and strained parent-child relationships. Research on its effects has produced mixed results, with some children thriving under such pressure and others experiencing emotional or behavioral difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Chengkui Liu and colleagues sought to examine how maternal dominance in educational decision-making affects adolescent human capital—a term that encompasses the knowledge, skills, and attributes that contribute to a person’s productivity and life outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data from the 2014 wave of the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), a nationally representative longitudinal survey covering 25 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in China. While the CFPS has been conducted regularly since 2010, the 2014 wave was used because it includes detailed data on household decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive ability was assessed using standardized word memory and math tests. Non-cognitive ability was measured using indicators related to the Big Five personality traits: conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion, openness, and emotional stability. Maternal dominance was defined based on whether the mother reported having the final say in decisions about the child’s education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that approximately 49% of mothers reported having decision-making authority over their child’s education. Children of these mothers, on average, scored higher on cognitive ability tests but lower on measures of non-cognitive traits compared to those whose mothers did not have such authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Girls tended to outperform boys on cognitive measures, although there were no significant gender differences in non-cognitive outcomes. The researchers found that maternal dominance was linked to increased parental time spent on daily care and homework supervision, greater provision of academic resources, and reduced time spent on leisure activities. However, there was no corresponding increase in emotionally responsive parenting or activities aimed at social or emotional development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is clear that as mothers have the decision-making authority in children’s education, parents allocate more time to daily care and homework tutoring and provide additional extracurricular learning resources for adolescents, ultimately enhancing their cognitive abilities,” the authors wrote. “Meanwhile, parents tend to be more demanding. Conversely, the mothers’ dominance in the children’s educational decisions results in reduced investment in leisure time, with no statistically significant effects on parents’ responsiveness and activities related to talent development, mental growth, and parent-child bonding. The above three mechanisms indicate that when mothers hold dominant positions in their children’s educational decisions, they are more likely to adopt a ‘tiger mom’ approach to fostering their children’s human capital development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study offers important insights into parenting and developmental outcomes in China, the correlational nature of the analysis limits the ability to draw firm conclusions about causality. Additionally, the use of Big Five personality traits as a proxy for non-cognitive ability, though common in psychological research, remains subject to debate regarding its comprehensiveness and validity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ehb.2024.101463"&gt;Cognitive or non-cognitive?

Researchers analyzed samples from PCS patients and identified key immune and gut-related biomarkers linked to inflammation and intestinal barrier dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, altered levels of IL-6 and a higher LBP/sCD14 ratio suggest chronic immune activation in PCS sufferers. These findings suggest gut monitoring may be vital in predicting and managing long-term post-COVID symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune Changes:&lt;/strong&gt; PCS patients showed increased inflammatory markers like IL-6 and an elevated LBP/sCD14 ratio.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gut Health Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Individuals with prior gastrointestinal symptoms were more likely to develop post-viral fatigue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Monitoring gut-related biomarkers may help identify and treat PCS earlier.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Medical University of Vienna&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a recent study, a research team from the Medical University of Vienna has gained new insights into post-COVID syndrome (PCS) and the relevance of a healthy gastrointestinal tract. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was recently published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Allergy&lt;/em&gt;, shows that PCS patients have altered inflammatory markers and a disturbed intestinal barrier, which could contribute to the development of post-viral fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110289"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a man holding his stomach." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In addition, there were increased IL-6 levels, which are considered a marker for systemic inflammatory reactions. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers, led by Eva Untersmayr-Elsenhuber from MedUni Vienna’s Center for Pathophysiology, Infectiology and Immunology, analyzed data from a prospective observational study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The course of SARS-CoV-2 infections and gastrointestinal symptoms before, during and after the infection were examined. In addition, blood, saliva and stool samples from PCS patients were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results show that patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal complaints have an increased risk of developing PCS fatigue. At the same time, prominent changes were found in certain biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, PCS patients showed an increased LBP/sCD14 ratio and lower IL-33 levels, which indicates altered immune activation and a reduced intestinal barrier. In addition, there were increased IL-6 levels, which are considered a marker for systemic inflammatory reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection can have long-term effects on the immune system and intestinal health that contribute to the development of PCS,” explains Eva Untersmayr-Elsenhuber. She is co-director of the National Reference Center for Postviral Syndromes at MedUni Vienna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developing targeted treatment strategies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study underlines the central role of the gastrointestinal tract in the development of long-term consequences after COVID-19. Monitoring gastrointestinal symptoms and biomarkers could help to identify at-risk patients at an early stage and develop targeted treatment strategies. This could be particularly important for the treatment of post-viral fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What is particularly exciting is that our study participants were mostly young and healthy before the infection. Even the Covid disease was mostly mild or even asymptomatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One difference was the more frequently reported gastrointestinal complaints in the group that developed post-viral fatigue,” explains Johanna Rohrhofer from the Center for Pathophysiology Infectiology and Immunology, lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team plans to validate the findings in further studies. “The identification of predictive markers for PCS could enable personalized prevention and treatment in the future,” says Eva Untersmayr-Elsenhuber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this post COVID fatigue research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ea9a988f99998faa878f8e9f84839d838f84c48b89c48b9e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Karin Kirschbichler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://meduniwien.ac.at" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Medical University of Vienna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Karin Kirschbichler – Medical University of Vienna&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/all.16593" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gastrointestinal Barrier Disruption in Post-COVID Syndrome Fatigue Patients&lt;/a&gt;” by Eva Untersmayr-Elsenhuber et al. &lt;em&gt;Allergy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gastrointestinal Barrier Disruption in Post-COVID Syndrome Fatigue Patients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="all16593-sec-0001-title"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS) is the term for a condition with persistent symptoms in a proportion of COVID-19 patients after asymptomatic, mild, or severe disease courses. Numbers vary, but the current estimate is that after COVID-19 approximately 10% develop PCS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and associations with the development of PCS with fatigue, post-exertional malaise (PEM), orthostatic dysregulation, autonomous dysregulation, and/or neurocognitive dysregulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="all16593-sec-0002-title"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining medical record data from a prospective observational study with symptom analysis before, during, and after SARS-CoV-2 infection, we aimed to identify potential risk factors and predictive markers for PCS. Additionally, we analyzed blood, saliva, and stool samples from this well-characterized PCS patient cohort to biologically validate our findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="all16593-sec-0003-title"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified significant associations between pre-existing GI complaints and the development of PCS Fatigue. PCS patients showed higher LBP/sCD14 ratios, lower IL-33 levels, and higher IL-6 levels compared to control groups. Our results highlight the critical role of the GI tract in PCS development of post-viral Fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="all16593-sec-0004-title"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We propose that the viral infection disrupts pathways related to the innate immune response and GI barrier function, evidenced by intestinal low-grade inflammation and GI barrier leakage. Monitoring GI symptoms and markers before, during, and after SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for identifying predictive clinical phenotypes in PCS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the interaction between viral infections, immune responses, and gut integrity could lead to more effective diagnostic and treatment strategies, ultimately reducing the burden on PCS patients.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 15:54:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE5GRXdjSngyTDBRVk05b3Vhd0JrUkpzVFV0SV8xSnRYT1dCRWFZMlhobm5vRVBHaDRvMHdlSVdZREpHcGRwT0Q4SUJqZUF1ekx6Y0MyY215d2M0Q0ZmVktmOWtfMzlMOWtVRlpRcjlaZklCdlg0YTBocVE3QQ</guid></item><item><title>向度假者发出警告，因为美国度假热点受到维多利亚时代致命疾病“令人担忧”上升的打击-每日邮报 | Warning to holidaymakers as US vacation hotspot hit by 'worrying' rise in killer Victorian-era disease - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hawaii/index.html" id="mol-8e41d560-3717-11f0-bf19-131624c38f94" class=""&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; health officials are asking visitors to ensure they are vaccinated against whooping cough as cases reach an all-time high in the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this week, the state's Department of Health reported 108 cases of the Victorian-era disease — dubbed the 100-day cough — a stark increase from last year's 84 total cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to data from the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-46831e30-371e-11f0-9ee9-c37da55ef89e"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, about 10,000 cases of the coughing malady and nearly a dozen deaths have already been reported across the country this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whooping cough, also known as pertussis, is a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14667277/whooping-cough-infection-cases-rise-17-fold-year-ukhsa-vaccinated.html"&gt;highly contagious respiratory infection&lt;/a&gt; caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis and mainly affects infants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The illness leads to violent coughing fits, fever, sore eyes and blue lips. In severe cases, it can also lead to vomiting, exhaustion and breathing issues and is fatal in about one percent of babies who catch the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Given the sudden increase in cases, Dr Sarah Kemble, Hawaii State Health Department epidemiologist released a statement asking all adults - particularly those with infants - to be vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'Whooping cough is a highly contagious respiratory disease that spreads through the air via the coughs or sneezes of an infected person&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's particularly important for families that are expecting a baby, so pregnant women, but also grandparents who are going to be holding the baby, dads who are going to be holding the baby. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hawaii health officials are asking visitors to ensure they are vaccinated against whooping cough as cases reach an all-time high in the state&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So everyone in the household who may be spending a lot of time around a newborn infant, we recommend that they also get their booster for pertussis.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The illness is initially difficult to tell apart from a cold, with the first signs typically being a runny nose and sore throat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But within a week, sufferers may develop coughing bouts which last minutes, struggle to breathe after coughing and make a 'whoop' sound between coughs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials said health complications can also lead to pneumonia, seizures, brain damage and even death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC recommends the whooping cough (pertussis) vaccination for children, teenagers as well as adults.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The agency recommends babies get the DTaP (tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis) vaccine at two, four, six, and between 15 and 18 months old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Children ages four to six are also recommended to receive a booster shot of the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC also states that preteens between the ages 11 to 12 should also receive a shot of Tdap to boost their immunity against pertussis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The shot is recommended every 10 years after that to adults including pregnant women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of 2023, about 87 percent of toddlers in Hawaii had received their DTaP vaccine shot as compared to a national average of 92.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The TDAP vaccine is 98 percent effective in children within a year of their last dose. In teenagers, the vaccine is 73 percent effective in the first year and 34 percent effective four years after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But fewer are getting it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Sarah Kemble, Hawaii State Health Department epidemiologist released a statement asking all adults - particularly those with infants - to be vaccinated.

This dropped to 93 percent for the 2023-2024 school year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of 2024, over 35,000 cases across all age groups were reported in the US out of which about 10 people died, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023, officials in Hawaii reported only three cases of whooping cough and no deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts believe that the sudden jump in cases in the tourist hotspot is due to increased vaccine hesitancy and decreased immunity in adults as well as older children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also warn even tiny dips in vaccine uptake allow the ultra-infectious virus to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials are also concerned that the confirmation of Health Secretary nominee Robert F Kennedy Jr may worsen whooping cough vaccination rates as the 71-year-old has expressed doubts about the efficacy of vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prior to the introduction of the pertussis vaccine in 1948, the US saw as many as 250,000 cases per year, but they have steadily dropped by more than 90 percent each year compared to the pre-vaccine era, the CDC states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC has also noted that the bacteria that causes whooping cough, Bordetella pertussis, is prone to mutations, which could make it able to evade vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The illness is initially difficult to tell apart from a cold, with the first signs typically being a runny nose and sore throat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials have been warning for months that the US is on track to see a staggering rise in pertussis cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Marcos Mestre, chief clinical operations officer at Nicklaus Children's Health System in Miami told CBS: 'We have been seeing some increase in pertussis cases that are coming through our emergency departments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Not necessarily requiring admission, but coming in for evaluation and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They're coughing to the point that they can't catch their breath. And those are the children we really worry about, when infants are getting infected and that could cause more severe illness.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Researchers tracked nearly 12,000 youth over three years and discovered that increased screen time predicted later depression, while depressive symptoms did not predict more social media use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kids’ average daily social media use jumped from 7 to 73 minutes, and symptoms of depression rose by 35%. The findings suggest social media may play a causal role in the development of mental health issues, particularly when exposure includes risks like cyberbullying and poor sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direction of Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Social media use predicts depressive symptoms, not vice versa.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alarming Trends:&lt;/strong&gt; Screen time rose tenfold; depressive symptoms increased 35%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyberbullying Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Victims were over 2.5x more likely to report suicidal thoughts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As rates of depression and suicide in youth spike, experts are asking whether social media makes kids depressed, or do depressed kids simply spend more time on social media?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study provides answers. Researchers at UC San Francisco found that as preteens used more social media, their depressive symptoms increased. Yet the reverse wasn’t true — a rise in depressive symptoms didn’t predict a later increase in social media use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, kids’ social media use rose from seven to 73 minutes per day over the three years of the study and their depressive symptoms went up 35%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), was published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by Jason Nagata, MD, MSc, associate professor in UCSF’s Department of Pediatrics, examined data following nearly 12,000 kids aged 9 to 10 years and then three years later at 12 to 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is among the first to use within-person longitudinal data, meaning researchers could track changes over time in each child to accurately assess the link between social media and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There has been ongoing debate about whether social media contributes to depression or simply reflects underlying depressive symptoms,” said Nagata. “These findings provide evidence that social media may be contributing to the development of depressive symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s unclear why social media increases depressive symptoms, prior research points to risks such as cyberbullying and disrupted sleep. In fact, Nagata and team just published a separate study in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet Regional Health – Americas&lt;/em&gt; looking at the same cohort of participants, focusing instead on the effects of cyberbullying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found kids aged 11 to 12 years who were cyberbullied were 2.62 times more likely to report suicidal ideation or a suicide attempt one year later. Additionally, those kids were also 2.31 times more likely to experiment with a substance (4.65 times more likely with marijuana, 3.37 with nicotine, and 1.92 with alcohol) in the following year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, the youngest generations find themselves facing a catch-22, with growing evidence that social media is associated with depressive symptoms and risky behavior, yet it is also a primary area for them to connect and communicate with friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this reality, the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests using the tools in its Family Media Plan to create healthier digital habits for both kids and parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a father of two young kids, I know that simply telling children to ‘get off your phone’ doesn’t really work,” said Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parents can lead by example with open, nonjudgmental conversations about screen use. Setting screen-free times for the whole family, such as during meals or before bed, can help build healthier digital habits for everyone, including adults.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors:&lt;/strong&gt; UCSF authors are Jason M.

Sample sizes varied across waves and measures due to attrition and missing data. Analyses retained all available data at each wave. Data were analyzed from January 2024 to March 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exposures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-reported time spent on social media at baseline to 3-year follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reciprocal associations between social media use and depressive symptoms (Child Behavior Checklist) at baseline and at 1, 2, and 3 years of follow-up were assessed using longitudinal, cross-lagged structural equation panel models. Covariates included sex, race and ethnicity, household income, and parental educational level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At baseline, the sample included 11 876 participants (mean [SD] age, 9.9 [0.6] years), of whom 6196 (52.2%) were male. After adjusting for stable between-person differences and covariates, within-person increases in social media use above the person-level mean were associated with elevated depressive symptoms from year 1 to year 2 (β, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.01-0.12; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .01) and from year 2 to year 3 (β, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.04-0.14; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001), whereas depressive symptoms were not associated with subsequent social media use at any interval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final random-intercept cross-lagged panel model demonstrated a good fit (comparative fit index, 0.977; Tucker-Lewis index, 0.968; root mean square error of approximation, 0.031 [90% CI, 0.029-0.033]). Between-person differences in social media use were not associated with depressive symptoms (β, −0.01; 95% CI, −0.04 to 0.02; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .46) after accounting for demographic and family-level factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this cohort study of 11 876 children and adolescents, reporting higher than person-level mean social media use in years 1 and 2 after baseline was associated with greater depressive symptoms in the subsequent year. The findings suggest that clinicians should provide anticipatory guidance regarding social media use for young adolescents and their parents.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 15:30:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE1JUWFfQjJYYTdTcUJvRnBZUktYdmZIQjVwY1k1R2otTnNkM2pZdmY5RGlkMUVnWVZieFMyaHdIMV9iU2txQjNjajFLSjd2VlI4eDc3Y0x5MzNFYWxlR0g4UjFBNWtnZy1MNUttSDNWNUtTZw</guid></item><item><title>皮肤科医生揭示了令人难以置信的微妙线索，即您的小痘痘实际上是癌症-每日邮报 | Dermatologist reveals incredibly subtle clue that your tiny pimple is actually cancer - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxNclpXQURPVHBmaUw5V21BWWpIdnVMcmcxbGpzdjhMdTFEUk1vYmpqeUNVTHN6SDdBUVBVSWFncDloc1N1Q2F0dDBSdlZTZHY2LVZqclZTemp4RngtLWtPRF81UVZjMThJdkFFUkQxci1GYU5rVGFlR0ZNSnEtY051MU9PRGJLT3V1TXhBX0ZOeW91MmRtT0FSc2J0dTLSAaIBQVVfeXFMTTNYSUVLY0tFZDhxbHJta2FBaDdMLU1tY09MUXR5ejFXMVNKMkpXZS1yN0xjSnVSY3daUTNMbXJNN2FKQkhMcldNZXhzbDhlaXI1RFZmZDRaX21mdGJJTjQzR2xhSmxvT1FUaGkybGg0TXN2bWd4ZU9ZdFJCem1CM0RaclBwVElsOUN1bWNxQVhyX1ExOU5rX1B5OTg5cXdHZkRR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A top dermatologist has flagged a little-known sign of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-07552a10-3718-11f0-b9b2-c5f94a3b7f4b"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; that patients often mistake for a hormonal spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the 'pimple' scabs over and bleeds, it's likely skin cancer, according to Harvard-trained dermatologist Dr Daniel Sugai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an Instagram video that's so far attracted more than 134,000 views, Dr Sugai warned that the most common form of skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), 'does not have to be an obvious growth on the face'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, it can be a small, non-healing sore, bump or even a patch of flat, scaly skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the video, he listed common symptoms of cancer he sees in his patients who have missed the warning sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'A complaint I hear patients say is that "I just washed my face and there's this one spot that keeps bleeding", and it does this bleed-scab cycle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So if you have a spot that's not fully healing or is very fragile with gentle trauma like washing your face, definitely see your dermatologist.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is likely because BCCs are typically fragile tumors and can develop blood vessels to help them grow, making them more prone to bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In a viral video shared to Instagram with more than 134,000 views, Dr Daniel Sugai warned that basal cell carcinoma (BCC) 'does not have to be an obvious growth on the face', and even your average spot could be a warning sign&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;For people of colour, a bump will grow and become darker than the surrounding skin, the top dermatologist said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sugai also advised if that pesky pimple doesn't go away after four weeks it could be cancer, and you should consult your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the average spot will go away in about a week, a skin cancer bump will not heal on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For those with darker skin, a bump will grow and become darker than the surrounding skin, the top dermatologist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For my patients who have skin of colour, I will find a pigmented basal cell most commonly and it's usually hyperpigmented with some red mixed in. And with time it will start to bleed easily.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Upon closer inspection with a dermatoscope, even the tiniest of spots can be skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pointing to an example, he said: 'This tiny spot on the lip was skin cancer and most people would have ignored it because it's flat and wasn't bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I looked up close and I was able to see these concerning features. There's tree-like blood vessles and I can see some small scarring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I took a biopsy of it and it turned out to be a basal cell carcinoma. I diagnose these everyday and I actually treat them surgically everyday.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pointing to an example, he said the tree-like blood vessles small scarring were an indication of BCC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; Dr Sugai's biggest for avoiding the deadly cancer is wearing sunscreen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'People don't realise that the first 20 years of life is so important in terms of sun protection, because getting those sunburns early on in life will definitely affect how healthy your DNA is later on in life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you're starting late in the sunscreen game, it's never too late. Keep wearing your sunscreen because we don't want to overwhelm our skin with DNA mutations that are induced from the sun.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It takes a scarily low number of sunburns—only five—to make you vulnerable to the condition that kills more than 2,000 people in the UK every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 75,000 people are diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma (BCC) each year and the condition accounts for approximately 70 per cent of all skin cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike the deadliest type, melanoma, these cancers are slow growing and doctors can almost always cure them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, patients often have to undergo invasive operations to remove large chunks of their skin in order to destroy the cancer—which can be disfiguring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most harmful type of sunrays are UVB which hit the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) and cause the most sunburn, as well as UVA rays which penetrate much deeper and contribute to ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both are ultraviolet, which means they cause skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A worrying 90 per cent of skin cancer cases in the UK are a direct result of sunburn and using sunbeds, according to Cancer Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 15:12:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxNclpXQURPVHBmaUw5V21BWWpIdnVMcmcxbGpzdjhMdTFEUk1vYmpqeUNVTHN6SDdBUVBVSWFncDloc1N1Q2F0dDBSdlZTZHY2LVZqclZTemp4RngtLWtPRF81UVZjMThJdkFFUkQxci1GYU5rVGFlR0ZNSnEtY051MU9PRGJLT3V1TXhBX0ZOeW91MmRtT0FSc2J0dTLSAaIBQVVfeXFMTTNYSUVLY0tFZDhxbHJta2FBaDdMLU1tY09MUXR5ejFXMVNKMkpXZS1yN0xjSnVSY3daUTNMbXJNN2FKQkhMcldNZXhzbDhlaXI1RFZmZDRaX21mdGJJTjQzR2xhSmxvT1FUaGkybGg0TXN2bWd4ZU9ZdFJCem1CM0RaclBwVElsOUN1bWNxQVhyX1ExOU5rX1B5OTg5cXdHZkRR</guid></item><item><title>感染者参加售罄的夏奇拉秀后，新泽西州的麻疹警报- HuffPost | Measles Alert In New Jersey After Infected Person Attends Sold-Out Shakira Show - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxOODJQY3JUNGV4T3psWGRfM2JJNXRTZGhva09ETWZlc2Y4cnlKZ3FCZnBUSVF6SlVaN2hyZG9ScXM3VGJSMDJXVmNudGxvMUwyZElGZTQ3eE1fZmF3VkVzNFU2MDdkRGZUZ0dRclRvSkdOc0w2alRWMUo1eTBGRTB0dlAtalk0Y2FnaEw0dzVPaVdXUFUwSTRidHlWR09ud9IBowFBVV95cUxPbC1MOHJGZXBrVmNrX19pX19CUDA3MkUwdzJNV1hqZjhpQmJsb01VTHhjWWdyQ25UX2xLRW1XQW5HSTNfdDFEMmNOM2ZjUzhpWTFEXzhZd2lzWUVZV0NfeDNYNDhfT0tmMkRSTmdYcm1hakJUMndjM0J6eVExOUlTWjQ5ZncxckVMYzdoUUZORG9kcldRSmwxN1VsalBWTG5SY1hz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of people may have been exposed to measles in New Jersey after attending a sold-out Shakira concert last week, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;An out-of-state resident infected with the highly contagious virus attended the “Whenever, Wherever” singer’s May 15 show at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, the state’s Department of Health &lt;a href="https://www.nj.gov/health/news/2025/approved/20250520a.shtml" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="announced" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682f2646e4b0ef574bf5dbff" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nj.gov/health/news/2025/approved/20250520a.shtml" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person, whose exact seating in the stadium was not shared, was at the venue from 7:30 p.m. until 1 a.m. the following morning.

— a bat-linked infection caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People become infected after inhaling spores of the fungus that thrive in bat feces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors say up to 40 percent of people with serious cases die from the disease, which infects the lungs and in serious cases spreads to other organs including the brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No family members died from the infection, and within 28 days of the cave visit — and following treatment — all were making a recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The family had visited the Venado cave in Costa Rica, where they crawled through bat feces for two hours and saw scores of living bats (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the CDC, which investigated the cases, said it underscored the dangers of visiting bat-infested caves and crawling through feces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The news comes on the&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/tv/article-14725961/The-fans-left-tears-Pedro-Pascals-shock-return-major-question-finally-answered.html"&gt; eve of the finale&lt;/a&gt; of The Last of Us season two, a hit HBO series where the modern world is turned on its head after whole cities are infected with a fungus that turns them into rabid zombies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Histoplasmosis is often misdiagnosed or diagnosed late because it symptoms, which are similar to pneumonia, can be mistaken for a bacteria or fungus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fungus behind the infection is spread in bird and bat droppings, and also lives in the soil — including in the central and eastern US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It does not spread between people, and also does not spread between animals if they become infected with the fungus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Revealing the cases in its &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7417a1.htm"&gt;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports&lt;/a&gt;, the CDC said only one family member did not get sick — the individual who did not go on the cave tour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family visited the caves on Christmas Eve 2024. They were in Costa Rica for a week, from December 21 to 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the sick patients, six family members were adults aged between 42 and 49 years old and six were children, aged between eight and 16 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only two family members tested positive for the fungus out of the four tested using a swab for fungus-fighting antibodies in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said more family members were likely infected, however, adding that in more mild cases it can be difficult to detect the antibodies in tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The caves were also linked to 51 cases of histoplasmosis diagnosed in 1998 and 1999&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The other 11 patients were suspected to have the disease, given the trip and their links to the patient who tested positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The caves were also linked to a histoplasmosis outbreak between 1998 and 1999 that sickened 51 people, including tourists and Costa Rican residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tests carried out on bat feces samples from the cave revealed they contained the fungus that causes the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms appeared within eight to 19 days of visiting the caves, with no family members reporting other sources of infection since the trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors are recommended to prescribe the antifungal itraconazole to treat the infection, but only in more serious cases. In mild cases of the fungal infection, the disease normally goes away on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some family members were initially prescribed antibiotics, which is not recommended because these could worsen the infection. The prescriptions suggest that the fungal infection was not initially suspected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC says the fungus that causes histoplasmosis lives along the Ohio and Mississippi river deltas. It has been detected in states in eastern, southern and midwestern areas of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Thoracic Society &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thoracic.org/patients/patient-resources/resources/histoplasmosis.pdf"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that up to 250,000 people suffer from histoplasmosis in the US every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Few of these cases are formally diagnosed and reported, however, with only about 4,600 cases &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8538056/"&gt;recorded annually&lt;/a&gt; according to CDC data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 120 people die from the disease every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 14:40:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxNejBLUkw5UWJmWm9FdnEtY0pCRmo4VnJrcTQ3MzR1R2Zva2tzelphMXUwa1F0Rklxd1M0elRTQWZET25idHE2SnZCZFhWanpaSjllc0kxdFlvYUdDNmE3UzlEYklvNEdDWkhPbzNJakVDLVBuZnJfbVcyODE0cDg4TklSZ0sxdHdHd0YxWFJURUlSb3gwYlpmd1FNbWxSSXZROU9XdDB3OHVZMW5lQ2otVmlVVHTSAboBQVVfeXFMTl9aWE95UnNGNTRsZnNVaVNoTGMyRjZsT3Noc0pNUE9iZFpEV004LWlpSWR2UzVONUJZZXV2bzluczhhS21WYlBIUjBHYmdPR095c0VxTUl5U0xiSVlrN0ZYVlN4QU56b3VhNEdGd0xzV3BjS3dkSVJOZDMtczJYWENidkpydHJWQVVyM1c3SmJ6SjFubXpHbjM1U1JkQUI2TE5CYmdaREQybFBiUjM2TmV4S3JsYXFITWVn</guid></item><item><title>“Ozempic Teeth”展示了好莱坞最受欢迎的减肥药物-无聊熊猫的丑陋一面 | “Ozempic Teeth” Shows The Ugly Side Of Hollywood’s Favorite Weight-Loss Medication - Bored Panda</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOUHZmOG5QWnBITjhhTFJSMnVTTm05cXFfSDRDaDNDUFlKbWVoYjRJVkFOX1k3SWlfMGQtdUlYTXNRek1EQzFELTFNeC16cDJtTmVLSzd2M2NiWlg0S2VGT1V4Z0w4WUlseTQ1cVAwQUgtbGlPOWdrbnRBdGhUNmZURlNMUmMyZ1ZIclN3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

one’s weight loss regimen could lead to receding gums, yellowing teeth, and decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the medication itself isn’t directly harmful to the teeth, side effects–particularly dry

Michele Green told the &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt;. “Ozempic might reduce saliva production, diminishing the mouth’s natural ability to cleanse the teeth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

used to or have the same cravings as they did before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the reduced acting of chewing can also impact one’s overall dental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sofina said the act of chewing helps stimulate the production of saliva, which naturally helps keep the teeth clean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Less chewing equals faster plaque build-up,” Dr Sofina Ahmed of Viva Dental told &lt;a

rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hello!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts further explained that Ozempic could lead to the recession of gums whilst trimming down the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fat loss in the cheeks and jawline can cause gums to shrink and smiles to look aged or sunken,” Sofina said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Taking another pill was Dolores Catania’s advice for the side effects of

You must always go through a real doctor though who knows what they are doing.

She advised switching to crunchy fruits like apple or veggies like celery to help with saliva production and natural cleansing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would also be ideal to speak to a dentist and discuss ways to combat the negative effects on dental health while taking Ozempic-like medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Patients [are] now being actively encouraged to see the dentist before they start a programme,” Dr Victoria Holden, a member of the British Association of Private Dentistry, told &lt;i&gt;Independent&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;“Just don’t take it then,” a social media user commented&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_2" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_3" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_4" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div id="postPoll-8734926" class="post-poll poll-wrapper single-post" data-poll-viewed="false" data-post-id="8734926" data-main-post-id="" data-poll-id="12427"&gt; &lt;input class="post-8734926-poll-value" type="hidden" value="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"&gt; &lt;div data-bind="if: isInitialised()"&gt;    &lt;div data-bind="if: !isLoading() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; isShowingResults"&gt; &lt;div class="poll-content"&gt; &lt;h3 class="answered-content-title"&gt;Thanks!

&lt;p&gt;The findings shed new light on how EBV may set the stage for MS to develop, and could potentially form the basis for new &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-treatment/"&gt;treatment strategies for MS&lt;/a&gt; and other EBV-related diseases, according to researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59813-z"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Epstein–Barr virus induces aberrant B cell migration and diapedesis via FAK-dependent chemotaxis pathways&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Most people infected with EBV by adulthood&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBV is most known for causing infectious mononucleosis, colloquially known as mono. It also commonly causes nonspecific childhood illnesses. About 95% of people in the general population have been infected with EBV by the time they reach adulthood, but most never know they’ve been infected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies have identified EBV as a key &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/risk-factors-for-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;risk factor for MS&lt;/a&gt; — in fact, there’s evidence MS can only develop in people who are infected with EBV. The specific biological mechanisms that link EBV and MS remain incompletely understood, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Understanding the contribution of EBV to the development of autoimmune diseases, and in particular of multiple sclerosis, is seen as key for the understanding of their pathogenesis [disease development] and the development of targeted therapies,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MS, the immune system launches an inflammatory attack that damages healthy cells in the brain and spinal cord. While many types of immune cells are involved in this inflammatory attack, B-cells are one type of immune cell known to play a central role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When EBV enters the body, the virus mainly infects B-cells. In this study, researchers discovered EBV-infected B-cells change their behavior and movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B-cells and other immune cells normally reside in the blood or in immune organs called lymph nodes. But when there’s trouble, like an infection or cancer, B-cells turn into homing cells, so named because they rush, or home, to the site of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have now found EBV-infected cells produce certain inflammatory molecules that cause infected and non-infected cells to turn into homing cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We were able to show that EBV-infected B cells exhibit characteristics of ‘homing cells,’” Henri-Jacques Delecluse, MD, PhD, co-author of the study at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), said in a &lt;a href="https://www.dkfz.de/en/news/press-releases/detail/how-the-epstein-barr-virus-promotes-its-spread-in-the-body"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Discovery could lead to therapies to prevent B-cell migration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through a series of experiments in cell and mouse models, the researchers showed EBV-infected B-cells move to other parts of the body, and they also undergo diapedesis, the process where immune cells squeeze out of blood vessels and move into the body’s tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We found that EBV infection … confers to these cells the ability to migrate and undergo diapedesis with high efficiency, two cardinal features of homing cells,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process may allow EBV-infected B-cells to move to the brain — and because B-cells in the brain are known to drive MS, this could potentially set the stage for MS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;Deciphering the reaction cascade that triggers EBV-infected B-cells to enter homing mode offers the possibility of targeted intervention to prevent B-cell migration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers found the movement of EBV-infected B-cells was governed primarily by two EBV proteins called EBNA2 and LMP1, and by an inflammatory signaling molecule called CCL4, which normally helps immune cells move to sites of infection, but has also been implicated in the development of MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The viral proteins EBNA2 and LMP1 increase the activity of pro-inflammatory [signaling molecules] such as CCL4, which have been shown to be relevant in multiple sclerosis,” Delecluse said. “As a result, the infected B cells divide and swarm out. The EBV-manipulated B cells overcome the barrier of the vascular endothelium [the walls of blood vessels] and penetrate into the brain, among other places.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discovery of this pathway opens the possibility of developing therapies to prevent B-cell migration, which could potentially have applications in MS and other EBV-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In proof-of-concept experiments in mice, the researchers showed inhibitors of B-cell migration could stop EBV-infected B-cells from getting into the brain, lending credence to this strategy as a potential treatment approach. The researchers stressed further tests are needed to see if this approach can be used safely and effectively in people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Deciphering the reaction cascade that triggers EBV-infected B-cells to enter homing mode offers the possibility of targeted intervention to prevent B-cell migration,” said Susanne Delecluse, MD, study co-author at DKFZ. “Using specific inhibitors, we were able to reduce the survival rate of EBV-infected B-cells and prevent them from spreading in the body, including to the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Multiple Sclerosis News Today</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 14:32:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxPcTF1RnN4LUFYNk5ZM2lVYlJ2SzE4RDJ0anNGNjl4OGVnYmFJZGhvUGtsbzU3ZVFnamZrRUtCbWYxaFZzQnRPbmliaTgxamhPMVZ6WWl2YXNWcEVXSll5Uk5xOG1RZmNmRXlMcFowS0ljb1JmRkFUTnA3dV9NQzFIRkVNRlZYTTVSSmpvOXpNSndlOXh4dnFHT1JzQUs3Q3R2VTd5V2lWSnA3U2VOWnoxNGpyb2VPQQ</guid></item><item><title>关闭阅读适合所有人-叛逃者 | Close Reading Is For Everyone - Defector</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX0FVX3lxTE5tbDBXc2t0SGw4b0plSmdLVEJqR0xoREtMNlVsMFdGUDU5VTZ1TGF5RHNCYlF3ZFR6SjFJa25VUEtFVGNlc0YwYTE3VUpIX3pBRkc4YzZFZng2WmM5WmZz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="PostContent_content__FblEJ"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Sigrid Nunez’s 2018 novel &lt;em&gt;The Friend&lt;/em&gt;, a famous writer kills himself. Not long before, he complains to the narrator about readers: “People talking about a book as if it were just another thing, like a dish, or a product like an electronic device or a pair of shoes, to be rated for customer satisfaction—that was just the goddamn trouble.” Students submit papers that say, “I hate Joyce, he’s so full of himself.” Online reviewers imply, “if a book didn’t affirm what the reader already felt—what they could identify with, what they could relate to—the author had no business writing the book at all.” The famous author quits teaching, quits writing. The state of the novel, its place in the world, is too depressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But hasn’t it always been this way?” asks the narrator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No doubt,” says the famous writer. “But in the past the writer didn’t have to know, the problem wasn’t right there in your face.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know it’s been this way—or something like it—for more than a century, because that’s how long it’s been since I. A. Richards conducted his experiment. A young Cambridge professor in the 1920s, Richards printed poems with their authors redacted, sent them home with his students, and asked them to produce commentary. They did, and their commentary, from these otherwise good students, was riddled with errors. Without the context of who wrote the poems or when, the students failed to make out the plain sense. They connected poems to irrelevant memories, offered stock responses, indulged in sentimentality, and allowed preconceptions about what poetry is to skew what they saw on the page. At a time when literature professors either lectured grandly or lingered over the minutiae of history, Richards set out a new path; he wanted to provide support for “those who wish to discover for themselves what they think and feel about poetry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading, a skill easily taken for granted, is difficult—all the more so when reading literature that wields language as a medium for art. In the wake of Richards' revelations, scholars in Britain and the United States developed a technique to address our failures. Eventually that technique took the name "close reading," and it remains the principal methodology of literary studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close reading is untimely. It bristles against today’s universities, which treat students as customers to please and as future workers to train rather than as people in pursuit of human flourishing. Jeff Bezos’ empire—Amazon; Goodreads; Kindle Direct Publishing, which dominates the perfervid world of self-publishing—encourages readers to “talk about a book as if it were just another thing, like a dish, or a product like an electronic device.” Social media compels us to attend to what we’re seeing for as long as it takes to scroll by. Every day, AI produces more of the words we come across, making it hard—maybe impossible—to care about reading them. I’m sure there were college courses this semester where students completed their work with AI and professors graded it with AI, cutting humans from the loop. It’s easy to see why close reading, which demands patience, openness to others, and slow, careful thought, is having a moment among academics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, literary critic John Guillory, emeritus faculty at NYU, well known in the small world of literary studies, published a slim volume, &lt;a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/O/bo239363263.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Close Reading&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, accompanied by an exhaustive annotated bibliography compiled by Rhodes College professor Scott Newstok that demonstrated that more people are writing about close reading now than ever. Jonathan Kramnick’s &lt;a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo208342791.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Criticism and Truth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has garnered disproportionate attention, occasioning roundtables, special sections of journals, and many reviews. Much more, including a volume I co-edited, is forthcoming. After a spell of taking it for granted, academics are rediscovering the quiet excitement of close reading, a relief from the overheated corporate pablum routinely suffocating us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But close reading is not just for academics, and it deserves a bigger audience. Not because it’s virtuous. Not because it makes us better people. (I know some great close readers who are real assholes.) But because it’s a thrilling way to think with others, to claw back some of the time taken from us daily by tech oligarchs (I have looked at Twitter impulsively several times while writing this pointedly long, difficult sentence), and relearn some of our capacity, atrophied into passivity by algorithms, for aesthetics, a term that arose in modernity to name a storehouse of values in dialectical opposition to those of capitalism: above all, treating texts as ends in themselves rather than as means to productive ends—treating them, that is, as art. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what is close reading? As my co-editor and I write in our book, “Close reading is the practice of paying attention to a passage of text to account for at least one aspect of its meaning and to make an argument about how it works.” Close reading ought not only be right but elegant. At best, it’s akin to the performance of a great athlete, giving its witnesses the sense that they’ve seen something true and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the best way to get a sense of it is to read someone else doing it, and the best place to start is with Erich Auerbach, a German Jewish philologist who lost his professorship under the Nuremberg Laws and fled to Istanbul, where he wrote his opus, a gripping study of Western literature from Homer to Virginia Woolf, &lt;a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691160221/mimesis?srsltid=AfmBOooXvBE-S9rTAqBqjKT2VWAfKvR80Klm30KWGiExgVf24tcNDKza" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mimesis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He was a model for many of the most influential figures in literary studies: Stephen Greenblatt, Fredric Jameson, Edward Said. He’s a secret source of so much of what happens in literature departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late in &lt;em&gt;The Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, Odysseus, who has endured 10 years of wandering to return home from the Trojan War, encounters his childhood nurse. No one has yet recognized him, and he does not want to be recognized. He appears a stranger. His erstwhile nurse washes his feet and, in doing so, sees a scar on his thigh, startling her into recognition. The mark on the body becomes, once noticed by a caring, knowing observer, auratic, suffused with meaning. At that moment, Homer interrupts the story with some 70 lines about how Odysseus suffered the wound that left the scar, only to pick up when the nurse drops Odysseus’ foot in the basin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We might think, given how we have learned to read stories in our time, that Homer interjects the history of the scar into the scene to induce a feeling of suspense, suggests Auerbach. But we would be wrong. Suspense requires a distinction between foreground and background, which is unknown to Homer, who writes everything in a fully saturated &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;. While narrating the history of the scar, he does not expect us to be waiting to find out what happens with the nurse. He expects us, argues Auerbach, to be 100 percent in the presence of the past. Homer must describe the scar because if he did not, we would be left with an unexplained, mysterious detail, which he cannot bear. Everything must be illuminated. He must account for the scar. Everything in Homer proceeds with clarity, “never a lacuna, never a gap, never a glimpse of unplumbed depth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auerbach sketches out this reading in &lt;em&gt;Mimesis&lt;/em&gt;’s first five pages. Then: “The genius of the Homeric style becomes even more apparent when it is compared with an equally ancient and equally epic style from a different world of forms.” Auerbach turns to the Binding, told in full in 19 verses of the 22nd chapter of the Book of Genesis. It is very short. God commands Abraham to sacrifice his son, Isaac. Abraham prepares to do so, but at the last minute, God, satisfied by Abraham’s show of faith, relieves him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auerbach quotes the opening, from the King James Bible: “And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said to him, Abraham! and he said, Behold, here I am.” I’d bet most readers—that is, you—don’t find anything particularly notable about this quote. You might, like me, have grown up with a monotheistic religion, making this kind of language overly familiar. Or maybe religion is too foreign to you to make anything of it at all. Learning to see what lies hidden before our eyes is part of the magic of close reading. Auerbach is a master at this. He teaches us how to notice. “Even this opening startles us,” he writes, “when we come to it from Homer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where does God come from to speak with Abraham? “He does not come, like Zeus or Poseidon, from the Aethiopians, where he has been enjoying a sacrificial feast.” Instead, he comes from the cryptic depths of background, from which he never fully emerges. “Nor are we told anything of his reasons for tempting Abraham so terribly,” writes Auerbach. “He has not, like Zeus, discussed them in set speeches with other gods gathered in council.” Why such opacity? Auerbach, ventriloquizing an interlocutor, offers that opacity is just in the nature of the Jewish God. But that is no answer: or it leads us to ask why opacity is in the nature of the Jewish God. Rather, in the kind of inversion that has become routine in the humanities, but nevertheless in Auerbach’s hands still dazzles, “The concept of God held by the Jews is less a cause than a symptom of their manner of comprehending and representing things.” The Jews did not create a style to fit their God; they created a God to fit their style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can learn about a people through its style, its literature, which bears an ineradicable record of its version of reality. This, at least, was Auerbach’s gambit. The method is close reading. Others do it differently and can be no less exhilarating. It starts with a cultivation of sensitivity to art and language, for no other reason than that, which runs counter to the great powers that profit from our clicks, our data, our hustle. It’s not easy to travel upstream, but it’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By middle age, the mind loses much of its lability. Or, speaking for myself, &lt;em&gt;my &lt;/em&gt;mind. When I was young, words more easily disturbed, elated, shocked, and surprised me. I don’t think art will ever grip me again like it did when I was 17, before I had a mental place to put each thing, before I had seen it all. But close reading gets me closest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would you begin if you’ve never taken a literature course—or if it’s been a decade or three? You must acknowledge that its words are how they are for a reason, their placement is purposeful, thus meaningful. Every word is a clue. No skimming. You must (metaphorically) listen to the text: what is it trying to do—to you. You might start with a poem or a novel you’ve read before, one you’d like to understand better. You might already have hunches about what it’s about. These might be confirmed upon rereading, or pleasingly foiled. As you read, a line might hit you. You feel struck. You pause. Here’s where close reading happens. Hold up. Linger with that line. Read it again, a few more times. What gives it its force &lt;em&gt;here &lt;/em&gt;in its immediate moment? Work out its power. Does it reveal something about the text’s project?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I read Karl Ove Knausgaard’s &lt;a href="https://archipelagobooks.org/book/my-struggle-book-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Struggle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, his six-volume opus, a retelling of his life in excruciating and, to me, utterly compelling detail. Then I reread it. A passage early in the first volume held me. “Understanding the world requires you to take a certain distance from it,” he writes. “Throughout our childhood and teenage years, we strive to attain the correct distance to objects and phenomena. We read, we learn, we experience, we make adjustments. Then one day we reach the point where all the necessary distances have been set, all the necessary systems have been put in place. This is when time begins to pick up speed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I read these lines, something clicked. I had a feeling they held a key to Knausgaard’s whole monstrous epic. He wants to stop time. More, he wants to go back in time, to restore the experience of childhood, before we lost our mental lability, before we tamed the world. As I &lt;a href="https://post45.org/2016/06/my-struggle-volume-1-dan-june-17/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; then,“His meticulous descriptions of rolling a cigarette, or the sound of a VHS rewinding, or the weather, and his abrupt scalar shifts to the geometric patterns of cities or the life cycle of delivery rooms or funeral parlors are bids to break our habitual understanding of the world and thereby dilate time.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knausgaard has a reputation for disarming simplicity, openness, innocence, and honesty. Though he calls &lt;em&gt;My Struggle &lt;/em&gt;fiction, readers take it as true. But he admits many times that he has a poor memory. “His transparency,” I wrote, “is an illusion.” &lt;em&gt;My Struggle &lt;/em&gt;is utter artifice. It is a desperate effort to make the world meaningful again. Not unlike close reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meaningfulness doesn’t happen alone. Close reading, as much as it can seem a solitary practice, is social—explicitly in my analysis of Knausgaard, which I wrote as an &lt;a href="https://post45.org/2016/06/my-struggle-volume-1-dan-june-17/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; to a few critic friends who were reading it with me. We published our letters as epistolary criticism. That only foregrounded what is always true: Close reading requires someone you want to persuade, someone whose judgment you care about, and for whom you want your ideas about art and life to matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Sigrid Nunez’s &lt;em&gt;The Friend&lt;/em&gt;, the famous writer fails to kill himself. Or so we discover in the penultimate chapter, which presents the rest of the novel as written by the narrator to imagine what it would have been like had her friend succeeded. He feels betrayed that she has written about him, however fictionalized, while he was institutionalized. For most of the book, the narrator addresses her dead friend as "you," but in the final chapter, the "you"&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;shifts to his dog, whom she has adopted, and onto whom her love for her friend has been transferred. She takes the old, infirm Great Dane to a house on the ocean where she can minister to him while he lives out his last days. Unlike her friend, who survives in &lt;em&gt;The Friend&lt;/em&gt;’s belatedly revealed primary world, the dog cannot express betrayal, cannot, as a dog, even feel betrayed; he can only feel, for her, she hopes, love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Friend&lt;/em&gt;, like the Old Testament, is laden with latent meaning. It demands interpretation. What can writing do? How does it do it? Nunez acknowledges that now is not an auspicious time for fiction. Creative writing has been professionalized, publishing conglomerated. Everyone wants to write, no one wants to read—or so we’re told. Nunez, by publishing her cryptic novel, confesses her faith that readers persist, and that if fiction works it is thanks to those readers.

The therapy uses a tiny implanted device that sends timed electrical pulses to the brain when patients perform successful movements, helping rewire neural circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who previously saw no benefit from therapy alone experienced unprecedented recovery through CLV, regardless of age, injury duration, or severity. These results mark a major step toward potential FDA approval and offer hope to patients with no current treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breakthrough Recovery:&lt;/strong&gt; CLV led to major functional gains in upper limbs for spinal cord injury patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology:&lt;/strong&gt; A tiny implant sends electrical pulses during targeted movement therapy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Step:&lt;/strong&gt; A Phase 3 trial with 70 patients will test CLV’s efficacy for FDA approval.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UT Dallas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a new clinical study, researchers from the Texas Biomedical Device Center (TxBDC) at The University of Texas at Dallas demonstrated unprecedented rates of recovery for spinal cord injuries.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, published in the prestigious journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; on May 21, individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury safely received a combination of stimulation of a nerve in the neck with progressive, individualized rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110269"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The implant was activated upon successful movements, resulting in significant benefits for arm and hand strength. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach, called closed-loop vagus nerve stimulation (CLV), produced meaningful improvements in arm and hand function in these individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unprecedented results position the UT Dallas scientists to proceed with a pivotal trial — the final hurdle on the road to potential Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of vagus nerve stimulation for treatment of upper-limb impairment due to spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach is based on over a decade of neuroscience and bioengineering efforts by investigators at UT Dallas. The therapy uses electrical pulses sent to the brain via a tiny device implanted in the neck and timed to occur during rehabilitative exercises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous work by UT Dallas researchers has demonstrated that stimulating the vagus nerve during physical therapy can rewire areas of the brain damaged by stroke and lead to improved recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Michael Kilgard, the Margaret Fonde Jonsson Professor of neuroscience in the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences and corresponding author, explained that treating spinal cord injury with CLV is different than conditions targeted in earlier studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In stroke, people who do only therapy may get better, and adding CLV multiplies that improvement,” he said. “This study is different: Therapy alone for spinal cord injury didn’t help our participants at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial involved 19 participants with chronic, incomplete cervical spinal cord injury. Each person performed 12 weeks of therapy, playing simple video games to trigger specific upper-limb movements. The implant was activated upon successful movements, resulting in significant benefits for arm and hand strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These activities allow patients to regain strength, speed, range of motion and hand function. They simplify daily living,” said Dr. Robert Rennaker, professor of neuroscience and the Texas Instruments Distinguished Chair in Bioengineering, who designed the miniature implanted CLV device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study served as both a Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trial and included randomized placebo control in its first phase, in which nine of the 19 participants received sham stimulation rather than active treatment during the first 18 therapy sessions, then received CLV in the latter 18 sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants ranged in age from 21 to 65 and were from one to 45 years post-injury. Neither of those factors, nor the severity of the impairment in those with any hand movement, influenced the degree of response to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This approach produces results regardless of these factors, which often cause significant differences in success rates of other types of treatment,” said study co-author Dr. Jane Wigginton, medical doctor and chief medical officer at TxBDC, co-director of UTD’s Clinical and Translational Research Center, and medical science research director at the Center for BrainHealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is remarkable from a medical standpoint,” said Wigginton, who planned the clinical interactions and patient protections for the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TxBDC has worked to treat a wide variety of conditions using CLV across 13 years of research. As a result, the FDA has approved vagus nerve stimulation for treating impaired upper-limb movement in stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wigginton said the latest results are especially exciting because they help people for whom there is no existing solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The people in this study have now gained the ability to do things that are meaningful for them and impactful in their lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newest generation of the implantable CLV device, designed by Rennaker, is approximately 50 times smaller than their version from three years ago. It does not prevent patients from receiving MRIs, CT scans or ultrasounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Phase 3 pivotal trial will include 70 participants at multiple U.S. institutions that specialize in spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-author Dr. Seth Hays, associate professor of bioengineering and Fellow, Eugene McDermott Distinguished Professor in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science, has been with the CLV project dating back to the earliest studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Prior to this study, no person with spinal cord injury had ever received CLV,” he said. “This is the first evidence that gains can be made. Now we will set about determining how we make this optimally effective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hays cautioned that it is not a foregone conclusion that the therapy will make it to patients after the next trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We still have a long road ahead. For many reasons — financial, regulatory or scientific — this could still die on the vine,” he said. “But we have positioned ourselves to succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team emphasized the importance of the dozens of people involved in the work — both the patients and TxBDC’s partners at Baylor University Medical Center, Baylor Scott &amp;amp; White Research Institute and Baylor Scott &amp;amp; White Institute for Rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This has been the hardest working, most altruistic group of professionals, and that has been incredibly impactful,” Wigginton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noting that even outpatient surgery is complex for those with impaired mobility, Rennaker added, “These patients said, ‘Put that device in me’ — that’s a huge commitment. They deserve credit for paving the path for others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other UTD-affiliated co-authors included Joseph Epperson BS’20, PhD’24, TxBDC research associate; cognition and neuroscience doctoral student Emmanuel Adehunoluwa MS’23; Amy Porter MBA’20, TxBDC director of operations; Holle Carey Gallaway MBA’23, TxBDC research biomedical engineer; and David Pruitt MS’14, PhD’16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kilgard has a financial interest in MicroTransponder Inc., which markets vagus nerve stimulation therapy for stroke. Rennaker is the founder and CEO of XNerve, which developed the device used in this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was funded by a grant (N66001-17-2-4011) from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), an agency of the Department of Defense, as well as the Wings for Life Accelerated Translational Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurotech and SCI research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4a39322c7b7d7b7b797a0a3f3e2e2b26262b39642f2e3f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stephen Fontenot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://utdallas.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UT Dallas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Stephen Fontenot – UT Dallas&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09028-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Closed-loop vagus nerve stimulation aids recovery from spinal cord injury&lt;/a&gt;” by Michael Kilgard et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closed-loop vagus nerve stimulation aids recovery from spinal cord injury&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decades of research have demonstrated that recovery from serious neurological injury will require synergistic therapeutic approaches.

Over four years, researchers tracked 238 children and found distinct patterns of symptoms depending on whether a parent had schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children of those with schizophrenia were more likely to show attention deficits, disruptive behaviors, and subclinical psychotic traits, while those with bipolar-affected parents showed more mood-related symptoms and subclinical bipolar signs. Protective factors such as strong parental functioning and higher socioeconomic status reduced the likelihood of problems, pointing to the importance of early monitoring and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Children of parents with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder are more vulnerable to mental health issues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptom Patterns:&lt;/strong&gt; Schizophrenia is linked to attention and psychotic symptoms; bipolar disorder to mood symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protective Factors:&lt;/strong&gt; Better family functioning and socioeconomic support reduce risk in high-risk children.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Barcelona&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study confirms that children of people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder have a higher risk of developing psychopathology compared to children whose parents do not have these conditions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;European&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Child &amp;amp; Adolescent Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, examines how the clinical and social characteristics of parents influence the mental health of their offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study confirms this increased risk and helps to better understand what factors influence mental health problems patients’ children”, says Josefina Castro Fornieles, coordinator of the study and researcher in the Mental Health Networking Biomedical Research Centre (CIBERSAM), at the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences of the University of Barcelona, Hospital Clínic and the August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS). The study has been carried out in collaboration with the team of the researcher Dolores Moreno, from the Gregorio Marañón University Hospital in Madrid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts followed the children of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder for four years, comparing them with a control group of parents without these pathologies. The study included 238 children (aged 6-17), who were assessed at the beginning and end of this period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analysed variables such as parents’ and children’s psychiatric diagnoses, family socioeconomic status, parents’ age at childbirth and the presence of subclinical symptoms related to schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition, symptom patterns vary according to parental diagnosis”, says Elena de la Serna, CIBERSAM researcher at Hospital Clínic de Barcelona and first author of the article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study reveals that children of people with schizophrenia have a higher risk of attention deficit disorder, disruptive disorders and subclinical psychotic symptoms. In the case of bipolar disorder, children of affected patients show a higher prevalence of mood disorders, attention deficit disorder and subclinical bipolar symptoms”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also highlights factors that can mitigate this risk. Thus, better parental psychosocial functioning and higher socioeconomic status are associated with a lower presence of mental health problems in children, underlining the relevance of family and social interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study, which is part of the BASYS (Bipolar and Schizophrenia Young Offspring Study) project, reinforces the importance of long-term follow-up of children of patients with severe mental illness and raises the need for preventive strategies in these high-risk populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although studies with larger samples are needed, this one contributes to a better understanding of the mechanisms of intergenerational transmission of vulnerability to mental disorders in childhood and adolescence”, the team concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this mental health and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d8aab7abb9b5b9aaacb1b6bda298adbaf6bdbcad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rosa Martínez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ub.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Rosa Martínez – University of Barcelona&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00787-025-02719-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Effects of parental characteristics on the risk of psychopathology in offspring: a 4-year follow-up study&lt;/a&gt;” by Josefina Castro Fornieles et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;European Child &amp;amp; Adolescent Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effects of parental characteristics on the risk of psychopathology in offspring: a 4-year follow-up study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offspring of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (SZoff) or bipolar disorder (BDoff) have double the risk of developing a psychiatric disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we report the effects of some parental characteristics on the offspring risk of psychopathology at 4-year follow-up. At baseline, 90 BDoff, 41 SZoff and 107 Community Control offspring (CCoff) aged 6 to 17 were included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 4-year follow-up, 71% of the sample was assessed. Parents’ and offspring’s psychiatric diagnoses as well as socio-economic status (SES) and global functioning were assessed in addition to parents’ ages at childbirth and offspring subclinical psychotic/bipolar symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis were used to assess between-group differences in the cumulative incidence of psychiatric disorders and subclinical psychotic/bipolar symptoms and the association of some offspring and parents’ variables with risk of psychopathology and subclinical psychotic/bipolar symptoms. SZoff and BDoff had a higher risk of psychopathology than CCoff at 4-year follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SZoff showed a higher risk for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), disruptive disorders and subclinical psychotic symptoms, whereas BDoff displayed a heightened risk for mood disorders, ADHD and subclinical bipolar symptoms when compared to CCoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher parental psychosocial functioning and SES were associated with a lower prevalence of psychopathology.

Researchers found that the drug improves function in reward-related brain regions like the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which is key to motivation and pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ezogabine also reduced abnormal connectivity between reward centers and regions associated with negative thoughts, such as the posterior cingulate cortex. These findings suggest that potassium channel openers could offer a new, biology-based treatment strategy for depression and anhedonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; Ezogabine targets KCNQ potassium channels to modulate brain activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reward Circuitry:&lt;/strong&gt; It normalizes overactive dopamine-related brain areas in depressed patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Shift:&lt;/strong&gt; Reduces connectivity between reward and negative emotion networks, easing symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Mount Sinai Hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A mechanism involving potassium channels in the brain that control brain cell activity could provide a new and fundamentally different way of treating depression symptoms in adults with major depressive disorder, according to two complementary papers published recently by researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In two new research articles, published in &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers provide new insights into how a drug called ezogabine may impact the brain to improve depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Depression is a devastating public health problem, and our understanding of what changes in the brain to cause the illness is still very limited,” says James Murrough, MD, PhD, Director of the Depression and Anxiety Center for Discovery and Treatment at Mount Sinai and senior author of both studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110261"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a head and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The results, based on functional magnetic resonance imaging, showed an important role for KCNQ channel openers like ezogabine in normalizing hyperactivity of the VTA in people with both depression and anhedonia. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work represents a major step in unraveling the potential role of a specific protein complex in the brain—the KCNQ channel—and how targeting it could eventually offer a significant new modality for treating depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ezogabine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2011 as an anticonvulsant medication for partial-onset seizures in adults with epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous neuroscience research in mice, conducted by researchers at The Friedman Brain Institute at Mount Sinai, suggested that increasing KCNQ channel activity could also represent a new approach to treating depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on these findings, Dr. Murrough’s research team became the first to test the hypothesis in humans with depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That study, published in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; in 2021, revealed ezogabine was associated with significant improvements in depression symptoms and the ability to experience pleasure (anhedonia) in patients who were treated with the drug compared to patients who received placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two new papers provide details from new analyses of the human brain imaging data collected from that initial clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first of the two papers, published in &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, sheds light on the effects of ezogabine on a specific brain pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study examined the impact of ezogabine on the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the brain, which is involved in the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter essential for motivation, pleasure, and reinforcement of behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results, based on functional magnetic resonance imaging, showed an important role for KCNQ channel openers like ezogabine in normalizing hyperactivity of the VTA in people with both depression and anhedonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Up to half of people with depression do not respond to first-line treatment, which may be due to the lack of interventions that directly affect the neurobiology underlying symptoms like anhedonia,” says Laurel S. Morris, PhD, Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine and first author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By specifically targeting VTA activity and connectivity, ezogabine could open the door to decidedly improved outcomes for people who struggle daily with depression and anhedonia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a second paper, published in &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, research revealed that ezogabine was able to normalize connectivity between the brain’s key reward regions and larger-scale brain networks including the posterior cingulate cortex, which plays a key role in internally directed thought and negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients who experienced greater improvement in their depression and anhedonia when treated with ezogabine showed decreased connectivity between brain reward regions and the cingulate cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these two complementary studies suggest that KCNQ channel openers can potentially alleviate the specific known neurobiological changes that occur in animal models of depression as well as change the function of larger brain networks that might be uniquely used in humans to regulate thought processes such as rumination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggested to us that drugs targeting the KCNQ channel may trigger antidepressant effects by reducing interactions between the reward centers in the brain and those related to negative thinking and emotion,” Dr. Murrough explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This hypothesis will require confirmation in larger clinical trials.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Murrough is a named inventor on a pending patent application for the use of ezogabine and other KCNQ channel openers to treat depression and related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopharmacology and depression research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#84e1e8edfee5e6e1f0ecaae0ebf3e8edeae3c4e9ebf1eaf0f7edeae5edaaebf6e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Elizabeth Dowling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mountsinai.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mount Sinai Hospital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Elizabeth Dowling – Mount Sinai Hospital&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-02957-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Effects of KCNQ potassium channel modulation on ventral tegmental area activity and connectivity in individuals with depression and anhedonia&lt;/a&gt;” by James Murrough et al. &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2025.02.897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Effects of the KCNQ (Kv7) Channel Opener Ezogabine on Resting-State Functional Connectivity of Striatal Brain Reward Regions, Depression, and Anhedonia in Major Depressive Disorder: Results From a Randomized Controlled Trial&lt;/a&gt;” by James Murrough et al. &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effects of KCNQ potassium channel modulation on ventral tegmental area activity and connectivity in individuals with depression and anhedonia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to half of individuals with depression do not respond to first-line treatments, possibly due to a lack of treatment interventions informed by neurobiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A novel therapeutic approach for depression has recently emerged from translational work targeting aberrant activity of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons via modulation of the KCNQ voltage-gated potassium channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) with elevated anhedonia were randomized to five weeks of the KCNQ channel opener, ezogabine (up to 900 mg/day) or placebo. Participants completed functional MRI during a monetary anticipation task and resting-state at baseline and at end-of-treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinical results were reported previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we examined VTA activity during monetary anticipation and resting-state functional connectivity between the VTA and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (mesocortical pathway) and ventral striatum (mesolimbic pathway) at baseline and end-of-treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results indicated a significant drug-by-time interaction in VTA activation during anticipation (F&lt;sub&gt;(1,34)&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.36, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.044), where VTA activation was reduced from pre-to-post ezogabine, compared to placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mesocortical functional connectivity was also higher in depressed participants at baseline compared to a healthy control group (t&lt;sub&gt;(56)&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.68, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01) and associated with VTA hyper-activity during task-based functional MRI at baseline (R = 0.352, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.033). Mesocortical connectivity was also reduced from pre-to-post ezogabine, compared to placebo (significant drug-by-time interaction, F&lt;sub&gt;(1,33)&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.317, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.046).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together this translational work is consistent with preclinical findings highlighting VTA hyper-activity in depression, and suggesting a mechanism of action for KCNQ channel openers in normalizing this hyper-activity in individuals with both depression and anhedonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effects of the KCNQ (Kv7) Channel Opener Ezogabine on Resting-State Functional Connectivity of Striatal Brain Reward Regions, Depression, and Anhedonia in Major Depressive Disorder: Results From a Randomized Controlled Trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide, with available treatments often showing limited efficacy. Recent research suggests that targeting specific subtypes of depression and understanding the underlying brain mechanisms can improve treatment outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study investigates the potential of the potassium KCNQ (Kv7) channel opener ezogabine to modulate the resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of the brain’s reward circuitry and alleviate depressive symptoms, including anhedonia, a core feature of MDD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in individuals with MDD ages 18 to 65 years compared daily dosing with ezogabine (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;=&lt;/em&gt; 19) with placebo (&lt;em&gt;n =&lt;/em&gt; 21) for 5 weeks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging assessed RSFC of the brain’s key reward regions (ventral caudate, nucleus accumbens) at baseline and posttreatment. Clinical symptoms were measured using the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and other clinical symptom scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ezogabine significantly reduced RSFC between the reward seeds and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus compared with placebo, which was associated with a reduction in depression severity. Improvements in anhedonia (SHAPS) and depressive symptoms (MADRS) with ezogabine compared with placebo were also associated with decreased connectivity between the reward seeds and mid/posterior cingulate regions (midcingulate cortex, PCC, precuneus).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that ezogabine’s antidepressant effects are mediated through modulation of striatal–mid/posterior cingulate connectivity, indicating a potential therapeutic mechanism for KCNQ-targeted drugs for MDD and anhedonia. Future studies should validate these results in larger trials.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 12:57:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE1fYmc2Nzc2UkRTYXpjLTdYN25rSDRBcGdBYklIYlpPWFM4VEdqbDVPejdDWHVRbkhsR2FkU19xMG5aMlZtYVdsUnI1RzVxU2dRRjB2Mng1UVhsbnJPZjcydXhDV0k1YWdHMWYzX0FaZENHX2VZdWRoNHR3OTdvVkk</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员报告道格拉斯发生汉坦病毒病例- The Record Courier | Health officials report hantavirus case in Douglas - The Record Courier</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxOVUNoZm1HNlZyMjNxTEVhRDYxX3QzQXVRdmtZMkNSY29DdFgtWjJQYnZyaE14Zk5SNVpkTllNaGRvN3l3bnZ0OVdZdjZPcmJDcHhiTkg0b1VQNDJLc2hPQU1sYkx6alNjVVdCLTRPOUVYcjU2a0FWblR6RnRmeU9BaF9GTk43SW9VTklfbDNta3RBQ25UM051dFVfLUJTS2s?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story_lead_photo"&gt;

     &lt;p&gt;The first Douglas County case of hantavirus in four years was reported by Carson City Health and Human Services on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man under 50 years of age was hospitalized after inhaling or coming in contact with rodent droppings, urine, or nesting material disturbed during household renovations in the weeks prior to symptom development. The investigation is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the fifth reported case of the virus in the eastern Sierra with a recent case in Washoe County and three fatalities in Mammoth Lakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About one-third of people with Hantavirus infections die, according to Mono County Public Health Officer Dr. Tom Boo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The occurrence of three cases in a short period has me worried, especially this early in the year,” he said in April in the announcement of the third death. “Historically, we tend to see Hantavirus cases later in the spring and in the summer. We believe that deer mouse numbers are high this year in Mammoth (and probably elsewhere in the Eastern Sierra). An increase in indoor mice elevates the risk of hantavirus exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="div-gpt-ad-1730490821564-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three Mammoth deaths don’t appear to be related to the usual activities associated with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As far as we know, none of these deceased individuals engaged in activities typically associated with exposure, such as cleaning out poorly ventilated indoor areas or outbuildings with a lot of mouse waste,” Boo said. “Instead, these folks may have been exposed during normal daily activities, either in the home or the workplace. Many of us encounter deer mice in our daily lives and there is some risk. We should pay attention to the presence of mice and be careful around their waste.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mono County has recorded 27 cases since it was first reported here in 1993, the most in the State of California. Twenty-one of these infections affected county residents, and six occurred in visitors who were infected in Mono.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People get infected with Hantavirus through contact with the feces, urine, or saliva of infected deer mice,” Boo said. “Most often this happens by inhaling contaminated particles in the air, although getting waste in your mouth from contaminated hands can cause infection too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incubation period after infection is usually two or three weeks but can range from one to more than seven weeks, after which illness typically begins as a nonspecific flu-like illness with fever, headache and body aches, also often with gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and occasionally abdominal pain. These early symptoms are usually not mild. Muscle aches, for example, are often severe.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="div-gpt-ad-1730489846745-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Typically, there is no cough in this early phase, and the presence of cough, runny nose or sore throat in the first day or two points more to common respiratory viruses such as flu or COVID,” Boo said. “Hantavirus often, though not always, progresses to involve the lungs after a few days, at which time a cough develops. Shortness of breath is a worrisome sign of worsening disease. This is Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome and it frequently worsens rapidly, with potential death within a day or two.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boo said the only source of hantavirus in the area is from deer mice. It does not spread between people and other rodents do not carry it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is a respiratory infection that mainly occurs from breathing in particles of infected rodent droppings, urine, or saliva, and can be fatal,” according to the agency that handles health reporting for Douglas County. “According to the &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.cdc.gov_hantavirus_about_index.html&amp;amp;d=DwMF-g&amp;amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;amp;r=7h_yVcxwm6Zr8GwSwGtD9GJqnPM6XUxrdMqsqN_0lAw&amp;amp;m=dBZQUo3Pw89Fcznjcvfuge74MjxJRWpwePiUInXkaLOuPoYWjEXzOiSM9BaczHvH&amp;amp;s=rf-hKrbgdEYucPkeyfRXiGAIo_uT_WDXbosZwYgmik0&amp;amp;e=" title="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.cdc.gov_hantavirus_about_index.html&amp;amp;d=DwMF-g&amp;amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;amp;r=7h_yVcxwm6Zr8GwSwGtD9GJqnPM6XUxrdMqsqN_0lAw&amp;amp;m=dBZQUo3Pw89Fcznjcvfuge74MjxJRWpwePiUInXkaLOuPoYWjEXzOiSM9Ba"&gt;Centers for Disease Control &amp;amp; Prevention (CDC)&lt;/a&gt;, 38 percent of people who develop respiratory symptoms may die from the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus has been in the news after it was determined to be what killed Gene Hackman’s wife and led to the actor’s demise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="div-gpt-ad-1730489961406-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not sweep or vacuum the area with urine, droppings, or nesting material.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A solution of 1 part bleach to 9 parts water should be used when cleaning urine and/or droppings (1.5 cups bleach to 1 gallon of water).&lt;ul type="square"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spray the solution on areas with rodent droppings and leave for five minutes before wiping the area with disposable paper towels or cloth. Dispose of the waste in a sealed plastic bag.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear gloves (i.e., latex, vinyl, rubber) and a face mask to avoid touching or breathing in viral particles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify areas where mice are, plug openings, and set traps; a deer mouse can fit through an opening the size of a nickel. Food should be stored in rodent-proof containers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                                        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What if, instead of killing mosquitoes to stop malaria, we simply cured them? Harvard scientists believe giving mosquitoes anti-malarial drugs could turn these notorious disease-carriers into harmless biters. Malaria, a parasitic disease spread by female mosquitoes, causes nearly 600,000 deaths annually, most of them children, and traditional prevention efforts have focused on insecticide-coated bed nets, which work by creating a physical barrier and killing mosquitoes that land on them, per the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1j554pgjgko"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                                &lt;div id="divStoryBodyBelow"&gt;
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        However, resistance to insecticides is rising, lowering their effectiveness. To address this, Harvard researchers tested a variety of drugs on malaria-infected mosquitoes and identified two that kill all parasites when absorbed through the insect's legs. The idea is to add these drugs to bed nets, so even if a mosquito survives contact, it will no longer be able to spread malaria. Study co-author Alexandra Probst calls the research laid out in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09039-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a novel approach, noting that the malaria parasite is less likely to develop resistance to these drugs due to the limited number of them found in each mosquito compared to an infected human.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Lab results look promising: The drug treatment lasts up to a year on treated materials, potentially making it a durable and cost-effective alternative to current methods. The next phase—testing these drug-coated nets in real-world conditions—will start in Ethiopia. Results aren't expected for at least six years, but the hope is to eventually use both drugs and insecticides on nets, providing a two-pronged strategy against malaria transmission. "Malaria control desperately needs innovation," study co-author Flaminia Catteruccia says in a &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/new-malaria-control-strategy-efficiently-kills-parasites-in-the-mosquito-could-lead-to-more-effective-bed-nets/"&gt;release&lt;/a&gt;. "This is a momentous step forward in the development of a new mosquito-targeted malaria control strategy."  (This content was created with the help of AI.

Unlike traditional CRISPR tools that edit DNA, this system repurposes CRISPR-Cas13 to act like a “mailman,” carrying RNA to damaged sites using built-in molecular zip codes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In lab tests, the technique, called CRISPR-TO, boosted neurite growth by up to 50% in just 24 hours, marking a major step forward in spatial RNA medicine. This breakthrough may enable safer, more effective RNA-based treatments for conditions like ALS, spinal cord injuries, and neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRISPR-TO System:&lt;/strong&gt; Cas13 delivers RNA to precise neural sites using molecular zip codes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Regrowth:&lt;/strong&gt; Promoted 50% greater neurite growth in injured neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Class of Medicine:&lt;/strong&gt; Introduces “spatial RNA medicine” for targeted cellular repair.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Stanford&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When a neuron in our body gets damaged, segments of RNA produce proteins that can help repair the injury. But in neurological disorders such as ALS and spinal muscular atrophy, or following spinal cord injuries, the mechanisms for moving life-essential RNA to injured sites within the cell fail. As a result, RNA molecules can’t get to where they are needed and damage becomes permanent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Stanford have developed a technology for transporting RNA to specific locations within a neuron, where it can repair and even regrow parts of the cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110257"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a neuron." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Typically, CRISPR is used to slice and edit genetic code, but in this case the researchers didn’t want to make any changes. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their work, supported by the National Institutes of Health, forms the foundation for a new class of therapeutics that the researchers are calling “spatial RNA medicine,” which they hope will lead to treatments for neurological diseases as well as traumatic injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the first time, we’ve harnessed the power of CRISPR technology to create a precise spatial ‘zip code’ that delivers RNA molecules exactly where they’re needed within cells,” said Stanley Qi, an associate professor of bioengineering and senior author on the paper published May 21 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Imagine being able to specifically target damaged sites within a neuron, repairing them, and promoting their regrowth – this is what our technology achieves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A CRISPR-based mailman&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, researchers have realized that the distribution of RNA within a cell – where specific molecules are located – may be just as important as what they are capable of doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An individual neuron can be over a meter long, and aging, injury, and mutations can all disrupt its ability to transport the tiny RNA over such a distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Therapeutic RNA can’t help if it doesn’t get to where it’s needed,” Qi said. “We wanted to create a technology that could reliably move RNA to where it needs to function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qi and his colleagues used a version of the gene-editing tool CRISPR, called CRISPR-Cas13, to target individual pieces of RNA (unlike the more widely known CRISPR-Cas9, which targets DNA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, CRISPR is used to slice and edit genetic code, but in this case the researchers didn’t want to make any changes. They simply wanted to move the existing RNA to a new place within the cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cas13 naturally acts like a pair of scissors, but we engineered it to act like a mailman instead,” Qi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Then we can tell it to carry the RNA from one precise location to another.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers paired Cas13 with specific localization signals that act as addresses, instructing the Cas13 where to deliver the RNA. Each location within the cell has its own address molecule, so the researchers can direct the RNA to various locations by adding different molecules to the cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qi and his colleagues used their technology, which they are calling CRISPR-TO, to screen dozens of pieces of RNA and see if any of them would help neurons to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They added CRISPR-TO to mouse brain neurons in a petri dish, where it carried the RNA molecules to the tips of neurites – fingerlike protrusions that form synapses and connect to other neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found several promising candidates, including one RNA molecule that increased neurite growth by as much as 50% over a 24-hour period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are discovering more RNA targets that could promote neurite outgrowth and regeneration,” said Mengting Han, a postdoctoral scholar in Qi’s lab and lead author on the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve added a new tool to the CRISPR toolbox, using it to control RNA localization inside the cell. This has never been achieved before and, importantly, it opens new therapeutic directions for treating neurodegenerative diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Safer, more effective RNA medicine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are using CRISPR-TO to screen additional RNA molecules to determine which ones will be most effective at repairing injured neurons in the brains of mice, as well as in human neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are at the beginning of understanding how spatial organization of RNA benefits brain repair,” Qi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope our technology will help people figure out which RNAs will be the biggest players for better therapeutics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the researchers are using CRISPR-TO to move endogenous RNAs – RNA molecules that are naturally produced within the cell. But it could also be used to provide precise control over RNA-based medicines, making them both safer and more efficient, Qi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This potential excites us tremendously,” Qi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not enough for a molecule to just be in the cell. We need it to be in the right location at the right time. With our precise, programmable technology, you can target any RNA in any type of cell and bring it to the site of need in the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was funded by the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the National Center for Research Resources, the Stanford School of Medicine Dean’s Postdoctoral Fellowship, and the American Heart Association Postdoctoral Fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this CRISPR and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0f6c6763606a6b66604f7c7b6e6169607d6b216a6b7a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chloe Dionisio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://stanford.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stanford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Chloe Dionisio – Stanford&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09041-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Clonal tracing with somatic epimutations reveals dynamics of blood ageing&lt;/a&gt;” by Stanley Qi et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clonal tracing with somatic epimutations reveals dynamics of blood ageing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current approaches used to track stem cell clones through differentiation require genetic engineering or rely on sparse somatic DNA variants, which limits their wide application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we discover that DNA methylation of a subset of CpG sites reflects cellular differentiation, whereas another subset undergoes stochastic epimutations and can serve as digital barcodes of clonal identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that targeted single-cell profiling of DNA methylation at single-CpG resolution can accurately extract both layers of information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To that end, we develop EPI-Clone, a method for transgene-free lineage tracing at scale. Applied to mouse and human haematopoiesis, we capture hundreds of clonal differentiation trajectories across tens of individuals and 230,358 single cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mouse ageing, we demonstrate that myeloid bias and low output of old haematopoietic stem cells are restricted to a small number of expanded clones, whereas many functionally young-like clones persist in old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In human ageing, clones with and without known driver mutations of clonal haematopoieis are part of a spectrum of age-related clonal expansions that display similar lineage biases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EPI-Clone enables accurate and transgene-free single-cell lineage tracing on hematopoietic cell state landscapes at scale.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 12:34:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE5tem8xaGEya05vQjdEQTRGWFhtS0VRV09lQm9kdWZjUzBkQVUyZlNJamVLZnBiSmhQeklDWmoxbXNPZjUtRXRfWW8waXFwTHhNdUdYM2JtMWdYWVIzLTk1bUVjeko0aVBkZjY3cw</guid></item><item><title>如果您觉得大自然在夏天为您服务，这62种产品可能正是您需要的防御- BuzzFeed | If You Feel Like Nature Is Out To Get You In The Summer, These 62 Products Might Just Be The Defense You Need - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxQRzRFVS1ZRTlYd0hiYTNJYVNRXzUwR0c1bWp5TVlybTJYd2JVenZfY1EwMUdHbmJJOFZDZDZfYzlic1AtbFBtS2lJTWtMbVBIZG9ManBlWGNwRUdpb2hTT0tVQlVqeXlLZHlkNkpRQzFoQnQxcnlWbXlacmlBZFFQQjZmbWFHTFlGeFM0cnduT0ZtazU5M2JaMTMwZUF4VVJN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Strictly Come Dancing's Tess Daly has said mouth taping 'encourages nose breathing for a deeper, more restful sleep&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mouth taping involves securing the mouth shut with adhesive tape, across the lips, before going to sleep, forcing the wearer to breathe through their nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, proponents of the practice believe, is what leads to benefits, as snoring is typically caused by tongue vibrations that happen when people breathe through their mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Advocates also say breathing through the nose can help protect against bugs, as it &lt;span&gt;triggers the production of a compound called nitric oxide, which acts as a defense mechanism against pathogens we inhale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nitric oxide has also been shown to relax blood vessels, lower blood pressure and even support kidney function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, researchers found that in 80 per cent of the studies, there was no evidence that mouth taping helped treat mouth breathing or snoring overnight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just two of the studies suggested that people with mild obstructive sleep apnoea may benefit slightly from the practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This common condition, which affects around 1.5million people in the UK, occurs when the walls of the throat relax and narrow or close during sleep, blocking the upper airway.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can interrupt breathing, causing sufferers to wake suddenly throughout the night and has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sleep apnoea can lead to serious health issues, including high blood pressure, increased stroke risk, type 2 diabetes, heart disease and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; Most concerning was the risk of&lt;span&gt; asphyxiation, the researchers said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who suffer from rhinitis—which occurs when the inside of the nose becomes irritated, causing a blocked or runny nose—allergies, or have a deviated septum, are more likely to experience breathing difficulties when using mouth tape, they warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the basis of these findings, Dr Rotenberg and his colleagues are confident that existing evidence does not support mouth taping as an effective treatment for snoring or sleep apnea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers note, further research is needed to ascertain whether mouth-taping provides other health benefits.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 11:09:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>想活得更久吗？以下是医生每天都要养成的小习惯。- HuffPost | Want To Live Longer?

And on a surface level, it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; a good thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The American Psychological Association defines resilience as “the process and outcome of successfully adapting to difficult or challenging life experiences, especially through mental, emotional and behavioral flexibility and adjustment to external and internal demands.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may be told you’re resilient if you recover quickly from a job loss or understand how to care for your own &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/mental-health" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="mental health" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682614b8e4b02c37b4df9ede" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/life/topic/mental-health" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; in a stressful home environment. &lt;span&gt;So, yes, resilience is a good skill to have, but I recently learned of the term “toxic resilience” &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIoeV8UsHja/?igsh=bXIwcW1wYWZ2ejNy&amp;amp;img_index=2" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="through a social media post" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682614b8e4b02c37b4df9ede" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIoeV8UsHja/?igsh=bXIwcW1wYWZ2ejNy&amp;amp;img_index=2" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;through a social media post&lt;/a&gt; from Dr. Aditi Nerurkar, a stress researcher at Harvard. In the post, Nerurkar says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; toxic resilience is when you power through and bounce back even when you shouldn’t, leaving you feeling totally stressed out and exhausted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Resilience, I don’t think, is a bad thing inherently, I want to make that clear. I believe it’s important to withstand discomfort and to manage the ways in which discomfort impacts our functioning on a daily basis,” said &lt;a href="https://bloompsychologyto.com/meghan-watson" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Meghan Watson" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682614b8e4b02c37b4df9ede" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://bloompsychologyto.com/meghan-watson" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Meghan Watson&lt;/a&gt;, the founder and clinical director of &lt;a href="https://bloompsychologyto.com/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Bloom Psychology &amp;amp; Wellness" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682614b8e4b02c37b4df9ede" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://bloompsychologyto.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Bloom Psychology &amp;amp; Wellness&lt;/a&gt; in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you get constructive feedback from your boss, you should be able to handle and work through that distress, Watson noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Do I think that is how everyone uses resilience? Not necessarily. I think a lot of people use resilience as a way to bully themselves into a motivational stance towards doing more, being more ... and it starts to feel a lot like performance and less like actual growth,” added Watson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what some refer to as “toxic resilience,” and it’s a way of bullying yourself into doing more and being more. Below, therapists share what toxic resilience means to them and how you can spot it in your everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toxic resilience is a byproduct of hustle culture.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the things that I have noticed is that [resilience] often is hustle culture repackaged,” said Watson. “And the question I usually ask my clients is, ‘What are you needing to be resilient from?’ And if that doesn’t seem reasonable, then the resilience isn’t either,” Watson added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people will work outside of their window of tolerance. A lot of people will push and push and push themselves to be more and more resilient,” said &lt;a href="https://theempoweredtherapist.com/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Danica Harris" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682614b8e4b02c37b4df9ede" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://theempoweredtherapist.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Danica Harris&lt;/a&gt;, a somatic therapist and coach based in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;We live in a society that rewards perfectionism and rewards the push-push-push habit, Harris noted. “You’re seen as more successful — more valuable, even — if you can do more. And I think that’s leading to a ton of burnout,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of sitting with burnout and taking a break from whatever the exhausting thing is, “The toxic resilience is like, ‘I’ll keep going,’ because there’s some belief that if I keep going, things will get better,” Harris said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And sometimes toxic resilience does lead to good outcomes, said Harris. This could be a promotion or a raise, for instance. But that still doesn’t make it a fair way to treat your body and mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toxic resilience can be a way to disconnect from your body, which can be a natural response to tough situations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you continually push yourself to do all the things — work long hours, unnecessarily take on projects at home, go to all of the social gatherings — it’s a way to distract yourself from what you’re really dealing with or what’s really going on in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If I just keep pushing, then I don’t have to be in my body. I can be dissociative,” Harris said. “When we think about the functional freeze state, I think that’s really connected to this toxic resilience, because it’s like, ‘Well, if I slowed down, I might actually have to contend with what’s happening. I might actually have to feel my feelings,’” she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I might have to notice that I’m pretty dissociative and not connected to my body, which means I’m denying my body what it needs,” Harris added. “And I think these are the real-world implications of this toxic resilience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re breaking your body down, you’re breaking your mind down, you’re breaking your spirit down. And for what?” Harris said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’re doing this to get a better position at work or to get the top spot in your class, which are good things. “But I think we have to be weighing out those positive outcomes with the cost on us,” said Harris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You might be able to work a 14-hour day ... but are you nourishing your body? Are you moving your body? Are you hydrating? Do you have friendships and relationships that you can turn to? Do you or do you feel isolated?” Harris said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sure, you can over function. Lots of us, especially trauma survivors, can over function. But you have to see yourself as an important factor worth tending to,” added Harris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And I think when this toxic resilience is present, we’re bypassing ourselves over and over again,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: SDI Productions via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;SDI Productions via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;It's important not to convince yourself that burnout is a normal response to resilience. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don’t have to tolerate unfair situations — that is not resilience. That is a trauma response.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s hard sometimes to use the word resilience ... because when people hear resilience, it’s like, ‘Oh, yeah, I just have to tolerate that. I just have to push forward.’ And I want to get away from this idea that resilience is tolerance over the long term. It’s not. It’s actually something a little deeper,” Watson noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you’re a parent of a Black son and have to warn them about the dangers of getting pulled over by the cops, you aren’t really teaching them resilience, explained Watson. “Are you really teaching them to be resilient? Or is that a trauma response?” said Watson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think resiliency then gets a little bit more dicey in that context,” Watson said. Resilience shouldn’t be rigid or an instinctive response to something, Watson noted. Instead, it should be flexible and adaptive to new circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watson equated resiliency to working out. When you go to the gym and your muscles don’t respond to your tried-and-true workout, you have to push yourself a little further to get the gains you want. But that doesn’t mean the discomfort and pain after exercise is always the sign of a good workout or always the sign of a bad workout, Watson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’ve got to be open to investigating whether or not you actually need that kind of discomfort to grow in the ways you want to grow, and if you don’t, then what are you being resilient against? What are you pushing yourself to do?” Watson noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You shouldn’t just keep being “resilient” if it’s making life harder for you or allowing a bad situation to continue. Because, once again, that is not resilience and is an unfair burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True resilience is not pushing yourself to the brink.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m wanting to help my clients reach a state of embodied resilience, which is them tending to their own resiliency and not living up to an external definition of resilience,” Harris said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that definition of resilience will vary from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“True embodied resilience is — what does my body need? And how do I tend to it so that I can keep going?” Harris said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The difference between someone being like, ‘Oh, she’s so resilient because she overworks,’ versus ‘She’s so resilient because she takes care of herself,’ it’s almost like a different starting and ending point, the outcome being like your well-being,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikq0v00293576hpqcm3bd@published"&gt;My mother grew up in a very Catholic family. So Catholic that my uncle joined the seminary right out of high school. He became a priest, but is able to make visits to see the family from time to time. We always have a big gathering where everyone gets together for Father’s Day, and this year, he will be able to make it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikq2r002c3576w54vaexa@published"&gt;The thing is, my ex-husband and I have gotten divorced since the last time we saw my uncle. My mom begged me not to say anything to him about it, and I foolishly agreed. Big mistake. Now my mom wants me and my ex to pretend to still be married when we both attend the family gathering on Father’s Day, because she thinks it would crush my uncle to learn of our divorce. Is she asking too much, or should we just fake it for one afternoon?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikqbm002h3576v7gzfxo9@published"&gt;I too grew up in a Catholic family and seem to recall hearing a lot about how wrong it is to lie? Religion aside, your mother shouldn’t be demanding that you do so. Her request is less about holiness and more about saving face. Which feels rather misguided, since it’s not as though your uncle is unaware of the existence of divorce—and if by some chance he decides to take yours personally, that is definitely his problem, not yours. Neither you nor your ex should go along with your mother’s ruse if you don’t want to.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="114" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikqdo002i3576gsaq7ilb@published"&gt;Her demand does make me wonder if perhaps &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; is the one who hasn’t fully adjusted to the fact of your divorce. There may not be much for you to do about that, even if it’s true, and it’s not as if you need any family member’s approval to do what’s right for you. I only point this out because &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; your mother isn’t entirely okay with your situation, that has the potential to have a greater impact on your life than whatever your uncle—who you don’t see very often—might think about it. If you think that might be the case, you can decide whether a more pointed conversation with your mom is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikqq2002l35767cdipomw@published"&gt;My husband “Grant” has a 6-year-old daughter, “Charity,” from his previous marriage. The custody arrangement he has with his ex is such where she alternates spending 10-day stretches with her mother and with us. Charity is a very easygoing, fun kid to be around and we get along well.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="177" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikqs6002m3576bcmqyb7h@published"&gt;The problem is that Grant refuses to engage in any kind of sexual activity with me while his daughter is at our place. He claims that he is uncomfortable doing anything because he is afraid of the possibility she will hear it or walk in on us and report it to his ex, who is an extremely petty and vindictive person.&lt;br&gt;Before the current custody agreement was hammered out, she frequently thwarted Grant’s efforts to spend time with Charity, and my husband says he “doesn’t want to give her any potential ammo.” Charity’s bedroom is all the way down the hall, so I very much doubt she will hear anything. I have suggested locking the door in case she tries to come in. Grant is against that because she sometimes has nightmares and will come running to jump in bed with us. I want very much for us to have children of our own, and at this rate I don’t see how it will happen. What can I do to convince my husband how irrational his fears are?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikqyf002p3576ipchs6mm@published"&gt;You have already presented Grant with a very simple, sensible solution—locking your bedroom door—and he still isn’t willing. Could there be something else, apart from his daughter’s presence, that has him feeling reluctant? Is he perhaps less certain than you are about having a child, or might there currently be a mismatch in your libidos? I’m not trying to make any assumptions, but whether it’s merely the anxiety over his child or something else, your sex life is important and he should be willing to try to figure this out with you.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="142" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikr0d002q3576zqfsew6i@published"&gt;People manage to have sex despite young kids being in the house all the time. If Charity had a nightmare and needed you, it’s not hard to yell “just a second!”, throw some clothes on, and go unlock the door. I imagine you’ve also told Grant that you can be quieter on nights when she is staying with you. Even if his ex is looking for reasons to punish him, I doubt she’s living under the illusion that you two &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; sleep together. (Also, I am not a lawyer, but I don’t think you can throw out a whole custody agreement because a child happens to do what many kids have done since time immemorial and walked in on their parents having sex. Which, again, does not &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to happen, because as you have pointed out, you can just lock the door!)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikr2b002r35762rz1zuks@published"&gt;If both you and Grant were fine with your 10-days-on, 10-days-off routine, that would be one thing—but you’re not. So I think it’s worth talking with him about this hang-up and why he’s been so hesitant. Be as kind and patient as you can be, but be honest, too, and let him know that you aren’t happy with the total lack of intimacy when Charity is in the house and would like it to change. You two might also consider talking with a competent sex therapist who can help you address whatever may be going on.&lt;/p&gt;

Her tics include barking and random singing and hopping up and down.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="138" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikrc4002v3576d5sq64wp@published"&gt;Recently, I learned while having a conversation with a family friend who had been there that my niece had been christened two weeks ago. She said she hoped that my family was feeling better, because my sister had told everyone we weren’t present because we had the flu. When I called my sister and demanded an explanation, she said that while she loves us and doesn’t mind spending individual time with Annie, she “didn’t want the distraction” at her child’s christening. I told her that we would spare her and the rest of the family the trouble, because we weren’t going to bother with any future invitations. My parents and my brother have all been saying the same thing: They love Annie, but don’t want events “ruined” or “disrupted” and that “it can’t be all about your daughter.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="109" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikre2002w3576b58jzp75@published"&gt;My husband’s mother, “Susan,” lives several states away. She has MS and is increasingly unable to care for herself. A few days ago, I learned that a position in my company has become available in the state where she lives. Susan adores Annie and they are very close (they FaceTime every few days). Annie does have friends here and a good but not great support system at school. My husband is a freelance writer, so a move would not be disruptive for his career. Given my MIL’s growing need for help and the way my family continues to ostracize Annie, is requesting a transfer the right thing to do?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikrko002z3576cndfuxmb@published"&gt;I’m sorry your relatives have failed to include you and Annie in family celebrations. I have a disabled daughter, and my heart really hurt for you as I read your letter. I don’t blame you at all for being angry.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="117" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikrn700303576m4maeff5@published"&gt;Moving, uprooting your lives, changing schools, and assuming responsibility for your mother-in-law’s care needs all represent major changes. You want to make the decision based on what is best for you and your husband and Annie. And whether you apply for a transfer or not, you’ll still have choices to make regarding your family. I did wonder whether you were thinking about this move in part to avoid doing so—as if your family members could just be out of sight, out of mind—but wherever you live, you will still have to deal with your feelings over how they’ve treated your daughter, and you’ll still have to decide whether or not to continue having a relationship with them.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="134" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikrq300313576k6yr43dt@published"&gt;I’m not saying this to give your family any sort of benefit of the doubt, but it’s unfortunately common for parents of disabled kids to have to do a fair bit of educating within their own families. It could be that further conversations with your family would help them better understand Annie, and how hurtful it is when they fail to include her. But I know that would be difficult labor on your part, and you might not be all that motivated to undertake it, especially when you don’t know that they will ever come around. Whatever you wind up choosing where your relatives are concerned, I hope that you and Annie continue to find meaningful friendships and community—the kind of love and support you deserve, even if your family refuses to provide it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikrts00333576cvnvu6nt@published"&gt;Approximately a month ago I hired a young man from a pet store I frequent to housesit for a day. His prices were outrageous, but I agreed since my regular housesitter was out of town. He changed $100 per trip to my house which was required two times a day so he expected $200 for a whole day. For the record I have never been charged that much. I am disabled and about three days before I was supposed to leave I became quite ill and decided to cancel by text. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/12/parenting-mulligans-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;He told me he charged a cancellation fee…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For those struggling to get more healthy foods into their diet Dr Nye recommended opting for frozen options that can be easily added to a variety of meals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Frozen fruit and vegetables can be just as beneficial and often easier to add to meals to get that content in’, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another tip for a longer life offered by Dr Nye was to ensure you get the recommend seven to eight hours of sleep per night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Shorter than seven hours of sleep daily is linked to a 12 per cent increased risk of death, with those who sleep over eight hours being linked to a 30 per cent increased chance,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It seems that having regular sleep patterns may be the key to getting the most benefit and potentially living longer’, the expert added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies show that prolonged sleep deficiency can put people at a higher risk for conditions like obesity, heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nye's final tip, knowing your family history for any conditions you should keep track of as well as attending routine health checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the doctor, genetic factors, including disease risk, hormone balance and cell replacement rates, are believed to influence between 20 and 30 per cent of your lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘About 40 per cent of life expectancy is inherited among generations, meaning you are more likely to live longer if your parents and grandparents did,’ he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Genetic testing, sometimes called genomic testing—which highlights changes in genes that can cause health problems—is mainly used to diagnose rare and inherited health conditions and some cancers. It can also help couples understand the risk of passing on a health condition to their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the NHS advises considering how the results could affect you and others in your family, as there is a chance that the test will provide information about your relatives that was not previously known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nye's advice comes as data suggests England' bulging waistlines have caused a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14409773/England-life-expectancy-rankings-calculator-long-live.html"&gt;significant drop in average life expectancy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After decades of progress, attempts to keep people living longer are beginning to fail, with people in England now living roughly nine months less than they did in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Separate data released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) earlier this year suggested that a baby boy born in the UK in 2023 could expect to live on average to 86.7 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Girls still have a longer anticipated lifespan of 90 years, although the gap has been narrowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of the latest ONS data, for 2023, there are just over 16,000 centenarians—people who have lived over 100 years—living in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
