When it’s acute, it tends to start suddenly, with an obvious cause (like a broken bone) and a standard fix. But chronic pain, experienced by 1 in 5 adults in the United States, persists for more than three months (or beyond an injury’s expected healing time). And it sometimes doesn’t have a clear cause. So if you have chronic pain, how can you find relief and improve your quality of life? “We’ve learned a lot in recent years about the major differences between acute and chronic pain, which require vastly different approaches,” says Kimeron Hardin, a clinical psychologist and president of the American Association of Pain Psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T2HA77FFDZG33OOI756EFKY7TQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Chronic pain goes beyond the sensory experience of “how much does it hurt and where does it hurt?” says Steven P. Cohen, an anesthesiology professor and vice chair of research and pain medicine at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. Our thoughts, emotions and behavior can significantly affect the physical sensation of chronic pain, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GZWA7WCR7BFKDNRVYSXOSVNZYA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Medication, physical therapy, steroid injections and implanted devices may be helpful, but newer research has discovered that techniques that target the psychological aspects of pain can also provide relief. In this article, we look at three such treatments. Ask your primary care provider if any of these might be an option. They can refer you to a licensed mental health professional who specializes in chronic pain. You can also find specialists at &lt;a href="http://aapainpsychology.org/" target="_blank"&gt;aapainpsychology.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="EBXF2LD3GFDFJEGFHECI3RR7EI" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="EBXF2LD3GFDFJEGFHECI3RR7EI" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AAIGDAFO5ZBK3LMVRARSNABZFQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This is a form of talk therapy that helps people identify negative thoughts and behaviors and develop skills to change them. For people with chronic pain, expecting the worst or focusing on the pain can actually increase the discomfort they feel. “Many people have fear-based or catastrophic thinking around pain that can make pain worse,” Hardin says. “CBT can help you understand patterns that might be exacerbating your pain and teach you how to recognize and replace those thoughts with something that’s soothing, comforting and even more accurate.” A &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007407.pub4/full" target="_blank"&gt;2020 Cochrane Review&lt;/a&gt; found that CBT led to a small but significant reduction in disability and distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="J64GJMVRBRGCRPZOE3CQWX2CIU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="J64GJMVRBRGCRPZOE3CQWX2CIU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Acceptance and commitment therapy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RNP5PMQVUZDUZKPCR45VAKDW4A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This has some things in common with CBT but adds in mindfulness techniques. And while CBT focuses on changing the way people think about their pain, ACT helps people accept their pain and commit to lifestyle changes that will lessen its effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GMJ53ZGQWRHALABKTY4REUBFYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Such changes are standard advice for conditions like high blood pressure, and they can be helpful for treating chronic pain, too. Physical inactivity, stress and poor sleep are all linked to more severe chronic pain. ACT also helps people distill what matters most to their quality of life, such as family time, and then figure out which actions can facilitate that despite the pain. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35228207/" target="_blank"&gt;2022 review of 25 trials&lt;/a&gt; found that ACT helped reduce disability and depression and improve quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="ZZXFKSFJXVFSHL5EI2X7BKMS2E" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="ZZXFKSFJXVFSHL5EI2X7BKMS2E" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Pain reprocessing therapy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GCZF2MXEX5CH7LDTRA2TML5KEU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;People with chronic pain that has no identifiable cause — such as fibromyalgia and some back pain — may become overly sensitive to stimuli such as pressure or heat, a process called central sensitization. Pain resulting from altered pain processing “means there’s no clear injury or nerve damage,” says Christopher Robinson, a physician-scientist in the department of anesthesiology, perioperative and pain medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y35EODHFTNFE3DEXTGICPHBYCE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Pain reprocessing therapy is an emerging technique that helps the brain “unlearn” this type of pain. Therapists have people engage in movement they fear will cause pain — such as bending — while training them to perceive their sensations as a result of nondangerous brain activity rather than tissue damage. It aims to silence what may be thought of as a false alarm from the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DYPWMUBXW5A2FGNPR63ZFFM34Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8482298/" target="_blank"&gt;2021 clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; found that two-thirds of people with chronic back pain who received four weeks of pain reprocessing therapy were pain-free or nearly pain-free after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p id="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" class="wpds-c-esEUdQ wpds-c-esEUdQ-hyvuql-isBold-true wpds-c-esEUdQ-ieHKbcq-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Copyright 2025, Consumer Reports Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p id="NGIOUE72HRGJHDJS2MZ36HBWDU" class="wpds-c-esEUdQ wpds-c-esEUdQ-hqvHjm-isBold-false wpds-c-esEUdQ-ifBuccc-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="NGIOUE72HRGJHDJS2MZ36HBWDU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Consumer Reports is an independent, nonprofit organization that works side by side with consumers to create a fairer, safer and healthier world.

            If you needed another reason to get your daily steps in, science just handed you one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji00023j6oy5rjmspn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A new study shows that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/24/health/walking-full-body-exercise-wellness"&gt;walking daily&lt;/a&gt; can reduce the risk of cognitive decline — especially among those with a genetic predisposition for Alzheimer’s disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji00033j6o56wbk3gs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Almost 3,000 participants between the ages of 70 and 79 reported their daily walking habits over the course of 10 years, according to research that will be presented Tuesday at the annual &lt;a href="https://aaic.alz.org/overview.asp" target="_blank"&gt;Alzheimer’s Association International Conference&lt;/a&gt;. Those who reported maintaining or increasing their walking habits over the years showed greater improvements in processing speed and executive function.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji00043j6o8jzswg20@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The benefits of walking were especially noticeable among those with a genetic predisposition for developing Alzheimer’s disease, according to the preprint, which has not been peer-reviewed or published in a professional journal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji00053j6oqnxkfta1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We know sedentary behavior increases as you get older, and physical activity decreases,” said senior study author Dr. Cindy Barha, an assistant professor of kinesiology at the University of Calgary in Alberta. “So we recommend reducing your sedentary behavior by introducing small bouts of walking in between those times you have to be sitting down.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji00073j6oj0qrlo8d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/07/health/alzheimers-dementia-ornish-lifestyle-wellness"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; is a severe form of dementia thought to be caused by a buildup of harmful plaques in the brain that interfere with how the nerve cells communicate, eventually leading to their death, Barha said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji00083j6o19b74beb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As more nerve cells die, people with Alzheimer’s can develop progressive memory loss, confusion, personality changes and physical decline. Eventually, the disease can be fatal, and there is no known cure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji00093j6oe2xvz34b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Genetics are thought to play a major role in the disease. Specifically, genotypes called APOE affect the metabolism of plaque and other fats throughout the bloodstream. One specific kind, APOE4, is known to make it harder for the brain to clear the plaques and is linked to a higher risk of cognitive decline.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji000a3j6oi5yu2y8i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About 15% to 25% of people have this version of the APOE gene, and the only way to find out is from a genetic test, &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/alzheimers-disease-genetics-fact-sheet#:~:text=APOE%20%CE%B54%20increases%20risk%20for,to%205%25%20carry%20two%20copies." target="_blank"&gt;according to data&lt;/a&gt; from the US National Institutes of Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmdm8okjn000v3j6owd9vzwd1@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="the-mind-body-connection" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            Although the new study did not test a uniform walking regimen, Barha suggests walking multiple times daily to break up sedentary behavior and maintaining consistent walking habits year to year to prevent cognitive decline.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000d3j6o7y7cgthn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “More research is really needed to determine how many steps that really takes, but more is definitely going to be better,” she said. “The next steps would be to actually try to figure out the minimum amount of walking for different subgroups, (such as) females versus males, APOE4 carriers versus non-carriers.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000e3j6obiw601kc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/06/health/step-dementia-risk-wellness"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; found that even people who walked about 3,800 steps per day at any speed cut their risk of dementia by 25%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000f3j6oapy6jy8s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What might be going on between the brain and the rest of the body? Experts have several theories.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000g3j6od0n57aq9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For one, regular exercise has been shown to help the body produce more of a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF, which is like fertilizer for your brain, helping it grow more cells and form new connections, Barha explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000h3j6o9fam138e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re thinking there’s proteins released from the muscle that travel to the brain and, either across the blood-brain barrier or at the blood-brain barrier, start a reaction that eventually leads to increases in BDNF within the brain,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000i3j6o3mqudc22@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another theory is that exercise reduces neuroinflammation, a common symptom of Alzheimer’s disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000j3j6ot4wu7eot@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The brain sends immune cells called microglia to attack plaque buildup, but this can backfire, explained Dr. Christiane Wrann, an associate professor of medicine at the Cardiovascular Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Chronic inflammation can lead microglia to begin attacking healthy brain cells as well, damaging the brain’s connections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000k3j6oig1ocd7v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you exercise, you actually strengthen the gene expression program that microglia need to function properly,” Wrann said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000m3j6og7pczdpw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers were surprised to find that walking provided the greatest benefit to those with the APOE4 gene compared to those without it. To understand why this is, more research will be needed — but Barha has a theory.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000n3j6ou7c2ehtr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Before the study started, we think APOE4 carriers had more room to grow in terms of cognition, since they may already have been experiencing some cognitive decline,” she said. “They also have more room to show improvement.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000o3j6o3ohj2zz2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s possible that the study itself also motivated participants with APOE4 genes to walk more than they had been beforehand, slowing their rate of decline.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000p3j6ogfdj711b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is a very strong example (that) it’s never too late to start exercising,” Wrann said. “Every step counts, and it’s much better to do an exercise regimen that you actually like, that you can actually stick to.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Physical activity lowers inflammation in the body. Evidence has shown that both aerobic and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2023/strength-training-gym-workout/" target="_blank"&gt;strength training forms of exercise&lt;/a&gt; are important. But only 1 in 4 Americans meet the two activity guidelines from the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-infographic" target="_blank"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;: aerobic exercise of 150 minutes per week of at least moderate physical activity, such as walking, bicycling on level ground, dancing or gardening, and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/11/29/weight-lifting-aging/" target="_blank"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; for at least &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/strength-and-resistance-training-exercise#:~:text=The%20American%20Heart%20Association%20recommends,protect%20your%20body%20from%20injury." target="_blank"&gt;two sessions&lt;/a&gt; per week, which typically translates to 60 minutes weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NCWIVNQFG5GBPLYBKMWS2NBPPA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The protective benefit of exercise is seen with even relatively low levels of activity, such as around &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurjpc/article/30/18/1975/7226309" target="_blank"&gt;2,500 steps per day&lt;/a&gt; (via sustained physical activity, not starting and stopping), and generally increases proportionately with more activity.

Two out of three people with obesity have this syndrome, which is defined as having three out of five features: high fasting blood glucose, high fasting triglycerides, high blood pressure, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and central adiposity (waist circumference of more than 40 inches in men, 35 inches in women).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FPQOFUC3PFHVRPHICZJ5J6EUMA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Metabolic syndrome is also present in a high proportion of people without obesity, about 50 million Americans. Prediabetes often overlaps with it. Prediabetes is defined as a hemoglobin A1c (a measure of how much glucose is stuck to your red blood cells) between 5.7 and 6.4 percent, or a fasting glucose between 100 and 125 milligrams per deciliter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2GDROICPCZGQXN6YE3CSKRX3SE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Both metabolic syndrome and prediabetes carry an increased risk of heart disease and can be prevented — and countered — by weight loss, exercise and an optimal diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7AKK4Z26XZEDZAYB2Y45LCD4HA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As the glucagon-like peptide drug family moves to pills and less expense in the future, these medications may prove helpful for reducing risk in people with metabolic syndrome and prediabetes. For those with Type 2 diabetes, the goal is optimizing glucose management and maximal attention to lifestyle factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="FP747BTMSBFRLAOB34FWUOR4PQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="FP747BTMSBFRLAOB34FWUOR4PQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;5.

The optimal blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg or lower. But with aging, there is often an elevation of systolic blood pressure to about 130 mm Hg, related to stiffening of arteries. While common, it is still considered elevated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZBS4Z3NB4RB7ZOEMFQOP6VF7UE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Ideally, everyone should monitor their blood pressure with a home device to make sure they haven’t developed hypertension.

The term polygenic refers to hundreds of DNA variants in the genome that are linked to risk of heart disease. This is very different from a family history, because we’re a product of both our mother’s and father’s genomes, and the way the DNA variants come together in each of us can vary considerably for combinations of variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YLR4N7RSHZBSRNDZI2RFUHE4NY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That means you could have high or low risk for heart disease that is different from your familial pattern. People with a high polygenic risk score benefit the most from medications to lower cholesterol, such as statins. A polygenic risk score can be obtained from a number of commercial companies, though it isn’t typically covered by insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N55MTVM6UNGAHJ5NHUBIC3OWK4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I don’t recommend getting a calcium score of your coronary arteries via a computed tomography (CT) scan. This test is overused and often induces overwhelming anxiety in patients with a high calcium score but without symptoms or bona fide risk. If you have symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease, such as chest discomfort with exercise, then a CT angiogram may be helpful to map the coronary arteries. It is much more informative than a calcium score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="6MQLJBMKUJE75AESQOP5GFJCQU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="6MQLJBMKUJE75AESQOP5GFJCQU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;7.

While lifestyle improvements can help, significant elevation typically requires medications such as a statin; ezetimibe; bempedoic acid; or injectables such as evolocumab (Repatha), alirocumab (Praluent) or inclisiran (Leqvio). The higher the risk, the more aggressive LDL lowering may be considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="34SN3RVQYVDJTG2MN6I7B2FTBE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It should be noted that the use of potent statins, such as rosuvastatin or atorvastatin, especially at high doses, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(24)00040-8/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;is linked&lt;/a&gt; to inducing glucose intolerance and risk of Type 2 diabetes.

Regularity means adhering to a routine schedule as much as possible, and its benefit may be due to our body’s preference for maintaining its circadian rhythm.

   &lt;p&gt;Back when &lt;a href="https://ph.ucsd.edu/phd/jdp/directory/faculty/boutelle.html" target="_blank"&gt;Kerri Boutelle&lt;/a&gt;'s children were younger, she remembers watching how kids would eat ice cream cones. She noticed a big difference between some siblings.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"One child would eat half of the ice cream cone and put it down," says Boutelle, who's a psychologist at the University of California, San Diego. Another child would eat their cone extremely fast, grab the leftover cone from the first child, and eat that one, too.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;For more than 30 years, Boutelle has helped children with eating disorders and obesity. This informal experiment, she says, illustrates something Boutelle and other scientists are starting to realize: not all children respond to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/05/25/1178163270/ultra-processed-foods-health-risk-weight-gain" target="_blank"&gt;ultra-processed foods &lt;/a&gt;in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some children are born with what scientists call a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4076308/" target="_blank"&gt;strong food reward drive&lt;/a&gt;, says psychologist &lt;a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/people/faculty/agearhar.html" target="_blank"&gt;Ashley Gearhardt&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Michigan. They feel extra strong motivation to eat. They're hungry often, may eat quickly, and they don't easily feel full or satiated. Kids with a strong food reward drive can &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/10/30/1208883691/diet-ozempic-wegovy-weight-loss-fiber-glp-1-diabetes-barley" target="_blank"&gt;regulate their eating &lt;/a&gt;with whole or minimally processed foods, she says. But with ultra-processed food, they struggle.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Popular advice around ultra-processed foods probably isn't going to work well when a kid has a strong food reward drive, Gearhardt adds. They need different help and guidance to feel good and stay healthy in our society, where these foods are ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"A strong reward drive served people in times of famine, but it's a nightmare in an ultra-processed food environment," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Does your child have a strong food reward drive?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Today children in the U.S. obtain nearly 70% of their calories — on average — from ultra-processed foods, which contain ingredients rarely found in your kitchen, such as preservatives, natural flavors and emulsifiers. Too many of these foods are tied to a whole &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/03/18/1238939706/ultra-processed-food-junk-food-disease-cancer-anxiety-depression-diet" target="_blank"&gt;host of health problems&lt;/a&gt;, including a higher risk of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34904160/" target="_blank"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831322004628" target="_blank"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10512104/" target="_blank"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5787353/" target="_blank"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40513976/" target="_blank"&gt;growing consensus&lt;/a&gt; among scientists that many ultra-processed foods &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(19)30248-7" target="_blank"&gt;trigger people to overeat.&lt;/a&gt; "Ultra-processed foods are engineered for people to over-consume them," says psychiatrist &lt;a href="https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/docs/default-source/events/2022-events/faculties/eating-disorders/dr-agnes-ayton.pdf?sfvrsn=43588ce3_2" target="_blank"&gt;Agnes Ayton&lt;/a&gt; at the Royal College of Psychiatrists in London.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These foods derail two critical aspects of our eating behaviors, Ayton says. They can prompt people to start eating even when they're not hungry, and they can keep us eating even when we're full.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"In our lab, we see that people are pretty good at understanding their hunger and satiety signals when they're eating real food," Gearhardt says. But once you start putting ultra-processed foods on their plates, she says, many people are really bad at eating what their body needs to maintain their weight.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And when you have a strong food reward drive, regulating eating around ultra-processed foods becomes even harder.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Let's go back to Kerri Boutelle's experiment with ice cream and look more closely at each child.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first kid, who ate only half the cone, has a &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; food reward drive. With kids like this, ultra-processed foods don't alter their behavior all that much, Boutelle says. They typically eat when they're hungry and listen to their satiety signals. "They just eat to get full, and then they move on," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The second child, who ate quickly and grabbed the leftovers, has a strong food reward drive. "They want to eat all the time, and it doesn't matter if they're full," Boutelle says. "Those kids are going to gain weight in today's environment" — unless parents help to protect them from the tricks of ultra-processed food.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I always tell parents, 'the environment today tricks kids into overeating,' " she says. "What you can do as a parent is make your home as safe as it can be for your children."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;How to help kids with a strong food reward drive&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;   1. Don't keep a bunch of ultra-processed foods around and then try to regulate how much children eat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some families store ultra-processed foods in their home, such as boxes of crackers, granola bars, pretzels and cookies. Then they try to teach children how to eat only a small amount of them at a time, Boutelle says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"But that's really difficult for children," she says. "And it's setting them up for failure." In fact, that strategy is really difficult for many adults, as well.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;    2. Try to keep ultra-processed foods out of your home, but allow them elsewhere.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A more effective strategy is not to buy these foods in the first place. And we know this is hard because the grocery stores are full of them. "But for some kids, it will really be beneficial," Boutelle says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Then you can help children learn to make healthy choices around ultra-processed foods when they're outside the home. Our society provides many opportunities to eat these foods, including parties, sporting events and even school, says psychologist &lt;a href="https://www.uwhealth.org/providers/katherine-e-schaumberg-phd" target="_blank"&gt;Katherine Schaumberg&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;You don't want to forbid these foods entirely, she says. That strategy could backfire. "In our culture, food is connection. Having these foods in social settings can facilitate emotional health," she says. "That can outweigh the physical cost of them."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;    3. If you can't keep them all out, keep no more than three ultra-processed items in your house.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Studies &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40513976/" target="_blank"&gt;show that variety &lt;/a&gt;increases eating. So, Boutelle says, limit the options in your home to only a few ultra-processed foods. For example, keep one bag of pretzels and one package of granola bars in the pantry, and that's it. "If you have ice cream, have only one kind," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;     4. Bring ultra-processed foods into your home only on special occasions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To help her two boys learn healthy eating habits, Ashley Gearhardt at the University of Michigan keeps her home basically free of ultra-processed foods. "We have minimally processed foods available to them anytime, except bedtime," she says. "If they're hungry, I tell them, 'Grab a banana, an apple, or some cashews. Go grab the minimally processed popcorn that we've got going on.' "&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then she buys ultra-processed foods infrequently and only for special events. "Like, 'Oh, we're having a bunch of friends over. Sure, we'll order a bunch of crappy pizza.' "&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We do not forbid ultra-processed foods, but our baseline is foundationally real food."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This approach works even with her son who has a strong food reward drive, she says. Because he can regulate easily with real food, and he doesn't have to keep resisting the urge for one more cracker, one more pretzel or one more bite of ice cream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What if entry-level jobs haven’t vanished? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What if we’re just not equipping young people with the skills those roles now call for? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For years, we told a generation that their future would be secured if they just mastered coding. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We restructured high schools around tech labs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://allwork.space/2025/05/the-bard-and-the-boardroom-why-todays-best-leaders-read-more-than-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Diminished humanities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; departments. Smirked at philosophy degrees. We insisted that fluency in logic, math, and engineering would lead to stable, well-compensated careers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But now, artificial intelligence is doing the coding. And the jobs we built our education systems around? They’re the first being automated away. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The tough truth: we spent years preparing students to behave like machines, just as machines learned to do their jobs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The issue isn’t that the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://allwork.space/2025/07/talent-development-in-the-future-of-work-starts-with-a-career-climbing-wall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;first step on the career ladder is gone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. It’s that it shifted, and we’re still looking for it in the old place. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Change We Didn’t Anticipate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The early-career jobs that once served as stepping stones into roles like analyst, marketer, developer, or support staff are no longer the go-to entry. Employers are now leaning on AI to complete those tasks more efficiently and at lower cost. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The people still succeeding? They aren’t necessarily those with the newest diplomas or technical badges. They’re the ones with insight. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://allwork.space/2025/05/working-smarter-with-ai-why-critical-thinking-is-still-your-superpower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Judgment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Human nuance. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the latest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hiringlab.org/2025/04/01/february-2025-jolts-report-scared-of-our-own-shadow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;span&gt;JOLTS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; numbers, U.S. hiring has dropped to a level not seen in over seven years. And the hit to early-career roles is even steeper — &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reveliolabs.com/news/macro/white-collar-workers-are-getting-the-blues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Revelio Labs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found that white-collar entry-level postings dropped 12.7% in the past year. Jobs like software development and business analysis saw declines near 25%. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And this downturn is gaining speed. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei recently&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/julianhayesii/2025/05/31/ceos-jensen-huang-and-dario-amodei-on-ai-adapt-or-be-replaced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;span&gt;cautioned &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that we’re “sleepwalking into mass unemployment,” warning that half of today’s entry-level knowledge jobs could be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://allwork.space/2025/05/anthropic-ceo-warns-ai-will-swiftly-decimate-entry-level-white-collar-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;gone in five years&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. These aren’t &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://allwork.space/2025/05/u-s-secretary-of-commerce-says-factory-jobs-for-life-is-the-future-of-work-for-you-your-kids-and-your-grandkids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;manufacturing roles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. They’re junior-level positions in finance, media, tech, and law — the exact tracks young professionals were steered toward. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This doesn’t signal the collapse of opportunity; it marks a necessary correction. One that exposes what we’ve been missing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;We Focused on the Wrong Edge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;AI can’t replicate lived experience. It doesn’t read social signals in a client pitch, weigh complex trade-offs, or assess team dynamics mid-crisis. It doesn’t know when to push, when to pause, or how to build trust across functions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those capabilities used to be built gradually — on the job, through exposure, mentorship, and real-world trial and error. But if AI is stepping into roles that once served as that training ground, we now face a new challenge: how to teach the human elements earlier. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While tech skills are being automated at lightning speed, AI still lacks imagination, empathy, moral reasoning, and contextual awareness. In a world powered by machines, it’s no longer about having the right answer. It’s about knowing the right questions, reading the full picture, and leading people through uncertainty. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We haven’t been preparing students for that. In the U.S., the percentage of degrees in the humanities has&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amacad.org/humanities-indicators/higher-education/bachelors-degrees-humanities" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;span&gt;dropped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from over 17% in the late 1960s to under 9% in 2022. Since the early 2000s, degrees in fields like English, history, and languages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailynous.com/2024/01/16/demographic-trends-in-the-us-philosophy-major-2001-2022-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;span&gt;have nearly halved&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Philosophy majors are now just 0.4% of all college graduates. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We treated this as evolution. As practicality. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now we’re realizing it was a mistake. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Human Skills Are the Real Competitive Edge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The most crucial skills in this AI era aren’t “soft” — they’re essential. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Empathy. Persuasion. Ethical reasoning. Cultural literacy. Systems thinking. Creativity in uncertain terrain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These skills are honed through literature, political science, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://allwork.space/2025/05/four-commitments-of-successful-anthropological-leaders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;anthropology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, ethics, philosophy, which are disciplines we’ve steadily pushed to the margins. Not because of nostalgia, but because they’re strategic assets. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because when AI can produce answers instantly, the advantage goes to those who know what matters, how to frame problems, and how to communicate meaning. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If we want to prepare future workers for a world where machines handle the tasks, we must reinvest in what makes us human. That means restoring the humanities — not as electives, but as core professional competencies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It means broadening how we evaluate talent to include clarity, curiosity, and adaptability, not just credentials. And it means recalibrating STEM education to include ethics, systems awareness, and human-centered thinking. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This isn’t about going back in time. It’s about catching up with the world we’ve already stepped into. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We trained a generation for technical precision, just as that became commoditized by machines. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now it’s time to invest in something AI can’t do: being deeply, powerfully human. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because when the bots deliver the output, the real value lies with the person who sees the bigger story, and knows why it matters. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

What seemed like a harmless appointment quickly turned into something far more serious—one that would eventually land him in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopher Kennedy, 68, went in for a simple X-ray before routine surgery, expecting it to be a quick visit. Instead, doctors spotted scarring on his lungs. Kennedy, a healthy, active retired Air Force tech who trained therapy dogs, had no clue anything was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Pulmonary Hypertension: Recognizing the critical symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after more tests, he got hit with a tough diagnosis: idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) — a lung disease with no clear cause that slowly robs you of breath, CBS News reported. At first, he thought he could fight it off. But by 2024, his doctors gave him a heartbreaking prognosis: less than a year to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later he underwent a lung transplant and his lung capacity is currently 98%. "He is back to spending time with his wife, children and grandkids. He is able to exercise at home and was recently able to take his dog for a walk without losing his breath. He's almost done training the canine, a Bernese Mountain dog named Fini, to be a hospital therapy dog," the report says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis: The lung disease you’ve probably never heard of—but should&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about your lungs—not in a scary way, but in a “this-is-good-to-know” way. There’s a sneaky disease out there called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF for short. It sounds like a mouthful, and honestly, it kind of is. But here’s the deal: this condition is serious, underdiagnosed, and affects thousands of people, especially older adults. And the kicker? We still don’t really know what causes it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So, what exactly is IPF?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its core, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a disease that messes with your lungs by causing scar tissue to build up inside them. Think of it like slowly wrapping your lungs in shrink-wrap. The more scar tissue, the harder it is to breathe. Over time, people with IPF find themselves gasping for air just doing simple things like walking to the kitchen or climbing a few stairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word “idiopathic” basically means “we don’t know why it happens,” which is a frustrating part of this disease. Unlike lung issues caused by smoking, pollution, or working in dusty environments, IPF just shows up uninvited. No clear reason, no obvious trigger. One day your lungs are fine, and the next, they start stiffening up like they’re made of cardboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the signs something’s wrong?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s where things get tricky. The symptoms of IPF are super vague—things like a dry cough that won’t quit or being out of breath more than usual. It’s easy to write these off as just getting older, being out of shape, or dealing with allergies. That’s why so many people get diagnosed late, sometimes when the disease has already taken a major toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/pulmonary-fibrosis/introduction/symptoms" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Lung Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, IPF can sneak up on people because its symptoms often mimic other, more common lung issues. Most folks start noticing signs somewhere between age 50 and 70, but by then, it’s easy to chalk things up to aging or being “a little out of shape.” That’s why it’s crucial to speak up if you feel something’s off—especially if you’re out of breath from basic activities, dealing with a nagging dry cough, or feeling unusually tired. Even symptoms like unintended weight loss, achy joints, or weird changes in your fingertips (called “clubbing”) could be clues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve got any family history of lung disease or have worked around chemicals or pollutants, don’t keep it to yourself—tell your doctor. And don’t be afraid to push for answers if your symptoms aren’t improving. PF has many causes, and getting the right diagnosis means seeing a specialist who knows what to look for. Early action can help manage symptoms and give you more control over your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why IPF deserves more attention right now&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, let’s face it—breathing is kind of a big deal. You don’t want to take it for granted. If you or someone you love is dealing with a mysterious cough or unexplained shortness of breath, it’s worth getting it checked out. The sooner IPF is caught, the more options you have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 05:23:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogJBVV95cUxPNGR2ZkZxc3lfejUtM1hSWEg5TUtMN0Y1alI4MlBYSzVUNlB1cXM0RkRfLTRPRE1tNXF1eFhxNGVKai1sTzFmWWlKbmpjcExGWlFQVXdfWmdpQzdFT2pMRUhHMlV4N0czYzhFa1BJT3l4emd2cVNEb1VudHUzUHh6b0RPMDBzQkFHeGdWTEhGa2M4YjlNTzBLaW1ZSUlJYndQUTREM3ROR2FmOUxTMmJWSEVtQTdvRk5rVjN6UzNla0haWnR3Q2hPTVJuLVdLYi1lbUctN2hkNWpWVXQ0Y1Q5dVMwSDM1cHNVMGtucGNudXZFR1FlaTN5Si1sS3BFZE9wRzNKNHdHMTFOWVVleElhaHMwSWk5c0d5cU54MVlQUWpTdw</guid></item><item><title>为什么6 ‑ 6 ‑ 6步行程序正在传播病毒，以及它如何支持减肥和心理健康-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAJBVV95cUxQQnN2Y2RobDdlUl9fd0piVWNxaEFvMlpVZmk4bzhMdWFXWEM5U1hYMXN5WWhZLVpmWThSX1J4Ri1PcDVjN24yQ3ZnSnlEcGNFbDRURzNJSTRMdV9VaGpiNWc4TkhIRmZrNTRfNDhTMU1hLTQxV1pjTnBZQ3FpNGpuQzZMVVB3Y292QUdZSDBDblp5OFdMNG1sWGpiYjAxWWxjbjV4TXNRTm05NExubExkclNYQ256MEhKeGNKczlFbi1sdmNjbFdQVUEzdVg3anRnQzBkWm44a2w5d2c5STJGYlM2dERlZEtaT1ZSc0xkNkl6NTA1MmtpX0RGdDVvYkp1ZXVUT3I5Ty00MEhKS3BsQmFSRTdoMDdoMlNiNQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 6-6-6 walking challenge has taken over social media, Instagram, and wellness blogs, despite its name sounding a bit ominous. The format is simple: walk for 60 minutes at a brisk pace, with a 6-minute warm-up and 6-minute cool-down, ideally starting at 6 a.m. or 6 p.m. Some people also interpret it as walking 6,000 steps per day for 6 days a week, offering a more flexible version that still builds daily consistency. Its popularity stems from the structure being catchy, easy to remember, and practical. Many find that having a set walking time reduces decision fatigue and makes the habit easier to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why the 6-6-6 walking format helps build healthy habits&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health and fitness coaches say the challenge works because it’s structured but not extreme. Committing to an hour of walking at a fixed time each day helps people incorporate physical activity into their daily routine. Doing it in the morning or evening also means it’s more likely to become a ritual, much like brushing your teeth. This kind of consistency is key for habit formation, especially for those new to fitness or trying to lose weight without joining a gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;From right shoes to warming up right: 5 safety rules to follow while walking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What science says about walking and your health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking remains one of the most underrated yet powerful forms of exercise. According to a 2021 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34477847/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;published in JAMA Network Open, walking at least 7,000 steps a day was associated with a 50–70% lower risk of mortality in middle-aged adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 6-6-6 challenge typically pushes you into that beneficial 6,000–7,000 step range within an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brisk walking also keeps your heart rate in the “Zone 2” aerobic range (50–70% of your maximum heart rate), which supports fat metabolism and endurance without stressing your joints. As supported by &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6355121/?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;data &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;from the American College of Sports Medicine, this level of aerobic activity helps improve cardiovascular function, insulin sensitivity, and even mood by lowering anxiety and depression levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can the 6-6-6 walk help with weight loss?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, but with a caveat. Walking can contribute to fat loss when paired with a calorie-controlled diet. On its own, though, walking an hour daily without adjusting your nutrition may lead to slower results. According to a study published in Obesity, participants who exercised in the morning (between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m.) tended to have lower BMI and waist circumference. However, the researchers noted that these were correlations, not definitive proof that walking in the morning alone causes weight loss. Personal experiences vary. One lifestyle writer reported improved alertness and energy but couldn’t sustain the routine due to fatigue and scheduling issues. Another participant enjoyed clocking over 15,000 steps a day but found the two-hour daily commitment excessive compared to her regular fitness plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who benefits most from the 6-6-6 walking challenge?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This walking challenge is ideal for beginners, people returning to fitness, or those looking for a low-impact exercise they can do daily. It’s inclusive, requires no special equipment, and can be done anywhere; just lace up your shoes and head outside or hop on a treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if your schedule is inconsistent or you're already doing intense workouts, the strict daily structure might not be sustainable. Fitness experts suggest adapting the plan: you can split the walk into two 30-minute sessions or do it five days a week instead of six. The goal is to make it fit your lifestyle, not disrupt it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The wellness benefits of sticking to the 6‑6‑6 walking challenge&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of a consistent walking habit go far beyond calorie burn:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improves fat metabolism: Brisk walking encourages your body to burn fat more efficiently without the high-impact strain of running.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improves heart and metabolic health: Regular aerobic activity helps regulate blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enhances mood and reduces stress: Walking outdoors, especially in the morning, exposes you to natural light, which supports your circadian rhythm and can ease anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strengthens muscles and bones: As a weight-bearing exercise, walking supports lower body strength and helps prevent bone density loss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 6-6-6 walking challenge offers a simple yet effective way to commit to daily movement. It’s backed by research showing the benefits of moderate-intensity aerobic activity and structured routines. While it won’t work miracles overnight, it can be a powerful habit when combined with balanced nutrition and realistic goals. If you're looking to boost your fitness, improve mental clarity, or simply get moving again, the 6-6-6 challenge is worth trying; just be sure to adjust the format to suit your needs and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/is-your-pillow-silently-damaging-your-neck-new-findings-explain-why-you-wake-up-sore/articleshow/122932054.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Is your pillow silently damaging your neck?

But what if there’s a scan that could tell you your real heart attack risk long before symptoms show up? There is a quick, painless CT scan that looks for calcium buildup in your arteries (a major red flag for heart disease). It’s way more accurate at predicting future heart attacks than just looking at cholesterol alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kicker? Most people have never even heard of it. Whether you're in your 40s and feeling fine or just curious about your long-term heart health, this scan might be the wake-up call you didn’t know you needed. Here's what it is, how it works, and why it might just save your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Heart Attack Warning Signs That Women May Confuse With Menopause Symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the &lt;keyword id="28027653" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="Coronary-Artery-Calcium-Test" source="keywords"&gt;Coronary Artery Calcium Test&lt;/keyword&gt;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CAC test is a simple, non-invasive CT scan (a type of X-ray) that looks specifically for calcium deposits in the coronary arteries the blood vessels that supply your heart muscle with oxygen-rich blood. These calcium spots are essentially hardened bits of plaque resulting from the buildup of fats, cholesterol, and other substances in your arteries (a process called atherosclerosis). The presence and amount of calcium in your arteries signal the extent of coronary artery disease (CAD), which is the main cause of heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;What do you think is the most important factor in assessing heart health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of it this way: Your cholesterol test gives you clues, but it’s kind of like guessing what’s inside a wrapped gift. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CAC test is like unwrapping it to see if there’s actually something you should worry about inside your arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A coronary calcium scan isn't for everyone, but it's the finest way for those who are uncertain about their heart disease risk to make better decisions about treatment and medications," &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-heart-test-you-may-need-but-likely-havent-heard-of" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;says &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Blaha, M.D., M.P.H., director of clinical research at the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at Johns Hopkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is this test a game changer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people rely on cholesterol levels (LDL, HDL, total cholesterol) and traditional risk calculators to estimate their heart attack risk. But these don’t always tell the whole story. The CAC test:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detects plaque buildup early often before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helps predict your actual heart attack risk better than cholesterol numbers alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guides decisions on preventative treatment, especially whether or not you should start or continue statin medications (which lower cholesterol).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gives you a clear calcium score, a numeric value that correlates with your risk level — from zero (no calcium, low risk) to over 1,000 (very high risk).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who should consider getting a CAC Test?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test isn’t for everyone. Various health guidelines suggest considering it if you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are between 40-80 years old.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have an intermediate risk of heart disease based on risk factors like age, blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, or family history.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are unsure whether to start statin therapy or want to weigh benefits versus possible side effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have a family history of early heart disease but otherwise seem low-risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your healthcare provider can help you decide if this test makes sense for you. It’s not typically recommended if you have low risk or already have known heart disease, because other tests may be better suited then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the research say?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies in the US consistently highlight how the CAC test improves risk prediction. For example, the MESA study (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) showed that CAC scoring can better identify those at risk of heart attack who might have been missed by traditional risk calculators. The test also helps avoid unnecessary statin use in low-risk people scoring zero, reducing overtreatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re worried about your heart health but don’t have clear symptoms, and your cholesterol or risk scores seem “in the middle,” a CAC test can be a powerful eye-opener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s something wild—Johns Hopkins researchers studied nearly 7,000 people to see how well we’re actually predicting heart risk. They looked at two methods: one used the usual risk factors like cholesterol levels, smoking habits, blood pressure, and diabetes. The other added in results from a Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) scan—that quick CT scan that checks for calcium buildup in your heart arteries. Turns out, adding the CAC scan seriously sharpened the accuracy. According to a 2013 study published in the European Heart Journal, some people who were told they were at very low risk based on traditional factors actually had high calcium scores—15% of them, in fact. That’s a big deal. Even more surprising? Around 35% of people flagged as high risk had zero calcium buildup, meaning they might not be in as much danger as once thought. Bottom line: the CAC test can change how we see and treat heart risk—big time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s quick, painless, and offers a peek inside your arteries that cholesterol tests simply can’t. The real value? Knowing your risk can save your life by prompting early treatment or lifestyle changes — or putting your mind at ease if your arteries are clean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This information is for educational purposes only and is not medical advice.

Elevated levels of these can pose a risk to cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sophia Gedgaudas, a stroke survivor, is the reigning women's champion at Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) in Louisville, Kentucky&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High Lipoprotein (a) is a genetic condition that creates a new form of cholesterol in the body that is similar to LDL (bad) cholesterol but has an additional protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This new kind of cholesterol causes a buildup of plaque in arteries, triggering inflammation and increased blood clotting, ultimately hindering blood flow to the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, people with this condition have a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes - even if they take precautionary measures such as eating health and not smoking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in five Americans, or around 64 million people, suffer from high lipoprotein(a).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Gedgaudas's case, her condition created a blood clot in her brain that resulted in a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the CDC, about 800,000 Americans experience a stroke each year while an estimated 138,000 Americans die from it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While usually associated with older populations, recent data indicates a concerning increase in stroke rates among individuals aged between 18 and 44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 120,000 Americans under the age of 50 and 1.5 million young adults worldwide suffer a stroke each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sedentary lifestyles, poor diet, substance abuse (including smoking and excessive alcohol consumption), and stress are increasingly recognized as major contributors to stroke in young adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told the website: 'It was a complete shock. I've been an athlete my entire life—a state champion gymnast, a black belt in karate, and a competitive dancer and cheerleader. No one ever expected someone like me to have high cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But because of my genetics, my lipoprotein(a) level raised my cholesterol to dangerous levels and that's ultimately what caused my stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At the time, I was completely paralyzed and could only respond with one word: "yeah." That's all I could say.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gedgaudas pictured here two days before she suffered a life-changing stroke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors told her that she had extremely high cholesterol due to a hereditary condition known as high lipoprotein (a)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gedgaudas's doctors initially prescribed her a tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) - a medication used to treat heart attacks by dissolving blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, due to the large size of the clot, the medication failed to work and she was forced to undergo a thrombectomy, a procedure where doctors insert a catheter into an artery through the groin to remove the clot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while doctors were able to successfully remove the life-threatening clot, she was left partially deaf as the stroke damaged parts of her brain responsible for hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The intensive surgery combined with the paralysis she suffered left Gedgaudas struggling to recover for three years, relearning how to walk, talk, eat and read. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During this time, she watched numerous wrestling matches and decided she wanted to pursue the sport rather than becoming a pilot and cheerleader. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She now battles a hearing disability, another long-term effect of the stroke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The now 25-year-old said: 'My dad would sit with me in the ICU and put wrestling on the TV. My mom says the first time I smiled after the stroke was while watching wrestling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Later, my brother took me to a live show, and after we left, I said, "That's what I'm going to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There were days I didn't want to get out of bed. I was angry, I was depressed. But watching wrestling made me believe I could do something again. It gave me hope and purpose.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once being given the green light by her entire medical team in 2022, she began training to be a professional wrestler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023, she made her debut and quickly became a standout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, Gedgaudas is the reigning women's champion at &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/ohio/index.html" id="mol-c39760a0-52c8-11f0-a7ef-eb27e70b591a"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; Valley Wrestling (OVW) in Louisville, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/kentucky/index.html" id="mol-c396eb70-52c8-11f0-a7ef-eb27e70b591a" class=""&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; - where wrestling legends John Cena, Dave Batista, Brock Lesnar and Randy Orton started their road to stardom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gedgaudas's condition caused a blood clot in her brain, resulting in a stroke and left her paralyzed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;For the future, Gedgaudas has global ambitions and hopes to one day wrestle internationally&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told DailyMail.com: 'Being part of OVW means everything to me. There's so much history here and amazing wrestlers that have come through, and I want to be one of the names. I want to show people a disability shouldn't stop anyone from reaching the top.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gedgaudas continued: 'For a long time, I was embarrassed that I was partially deaf. I saw it as a weakness and didn't want anyone to think I was limited. But over time, I realized it's just part of who I am - and there's nothing to be ashamed of. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now, I embrace it. I've learned to adapt in ways that work for me. I've gotten good at reading lips, and in the ring, I naturally turn my good ear toward the sound so I can hear what I need to. Most importantly, I stay super focused. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By staying locked in, I'm able to catch cues and respond without missing a beat. It's not always easy, but I've found ways to make it work - and even turn it into a strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I have to read matches differently, and I rely on instincts and body language. It forces me to be completely in the moment, and I think it makes me a better performer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To stay healthy and prevent another stroke, Gedgaudas workouts and follows a special diet comprised of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean proteins including chicken and fish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the future, Gedgaudas has global ambitions and hopes to one day wrestle internationally. But for now, her mission is personal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I want to wrestle in the UK, Japan, anywhere. But more than that, I want to keep helping people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's why I do this. Wrestling saved my life, and now I want to help someone else believe they can fight through whatever they're facing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 03:48:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOVG9QX1JQRThyUFBDOWttSGppNVRRYUxiaDc3NTZ3Ulp6OWRlMVVrZEZheFltQnhLa2Q3VG5mUnM2TmVad3poUE9MYWdCQk5kWHVnWWZLd3hET3BmbWVsUXpHbkRaRFhhT0lySmFZNzJtUUtKczdILWVhcXk0SUt3S3poVjYxaGVSM0JZOGVGVEYtMVE3Z0Y3YU5zeVZkZ1pmYVBYbNIBqgFBVV95cUxPQ1ZPQXBpVURXSVZWUUd5ejBOdGFmYW5zX3hGVHhseDhqZk9pWDNvR2tFRVhmMFVCSy1QV3RqOEZSSTdYdmlSWXdUZDFDZUwxbW8xa2JqcmwyNEgtR0E2dkN2QU9lV1VwV3psZXNXSkR5VXd0T3dJa0x2ektNWTV5dTFqQlVXMWJoNTFZSTZjdkwtY0pXcUZmRnVfZXJ2S0tkQXJRVVNHbWU5UQ</guid></item><item><title>新型牙线可替代疫苗针头，研究结果- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxNRVgtS0tWZGx5Nl9COGJjVUlkTG5ZZXhKT1hRYVN1MW82SE1aaVViY2lfXzExRjU3a3pCZFZLeDZ0Yi1EakVodWlQLWxEczY1eTMyT2xuN3NoM0RuTEw1cHhzdjlOZUNQNjNzVDU4NlBZdU5jYmVkRTFWVnhOSE1JejgzSjA5U1k3TThJdFNUNXJIYkNtc1M0Nno5SQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A fear of needles is a common reason for avoiding vaccines, even &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291721002609"&gt;among many adults&lt;/a&gt;. Now researchers have come up with a rather clever alternative: dental floss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by a team from Texas Tech University, the researchers first identified an often overlooked surface in the mouth as an entry point for vaccines: the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junctional_epithelium"&gt;junctional epithelium&lt;/a&gt; (JE), which sits where the gums meet the teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JE is leaky by design, because it allows &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-centuries-old-hack-is-a-proven-way-to-boost-your-health-and-immunity"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt; to move around and defend the oral cavity from bacterial attack. The researchers wondered whether this could also make this part of the mouth a suitable target for vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hypothesized that this leakiness of the JE could expedite the entry of vaccine antigens, and the abundance of immune cells in this microenvironment could elicit an adaptive immune response," the researchers &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01451-3"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;in their recently published paper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/which-arm-gets-vaccinated-could-play-a-role-in-your-immune-response?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Which Arm Gets Vaccinated Could Play a Role in Your Immune Response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delivering medications to the JE is complicated by the tissue's seclusion within the gumline, which is why it hasn't really been considered as a potential location &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.05.060"&gt;for introducing vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's where floss comes in, which is perfect for getting into tight spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested their hypothesis by coating dental floss with different &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-pfizer-and-moderna-vaccines-are-a-breakthrough-here-s-how-they-work"&gt;types of vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and testing them on mice across a period of several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169026" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169026" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/MouseFloss.jpg" alt="Mouse flossing diagram" class="wp-image-169026 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/MouseFloss.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/MouseFloss-600x246.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169026" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers targeted a specific part of the mouth in mice.

Eng.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were numerous encouraging indicators: strong &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/which-arm-gets-vaccinated-could-play-a-role-in-your-immune-response"&gt;immune responses&lt;/a&gt; were observed in the mouth and throughout the bodies of the mice, and the floss vaccine was effective in protecting mice against a later  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="169023" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further tests were conducted on human volunteers using dye rather than a vaccine, since  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="169023" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; are still some way off. The amount of dye that reached the JE target via flossing was enough to suggest that this really could work in us too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings establish floss-based vaccination as a simple, needle-free strategy that enhances vaccine delivery and immune activation compared with existing mucosal immunization methods," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01451-3"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not the first time scientists have looked beyond the thorough cleaning job that floss does. Earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-smart-dental-floss-can-detect-your-stress-from-saliva"&gt;research showed&lt;/a&gt; that floss could also be adapted to measure stress levels in the body, potentially giving doctors another useful diagnostic tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as being potentially less scary for those with a phobia of needles, floss-based vaccines would be easier to transport and store. Doctors and nurses wouldn't be needed to administer them, and they could even be delivered in the post – a real advantage in the case of pandemics &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-why-some-covid-19-strains-are-spreading-faster-than-others"&gt;such as COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have previously tried to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.03.017"&gt;deliver vaccines orally&lt;/a&gt; under the tongue and in the cheek, but not enough of the vaccine penetrates the tissue into circulation. While there's still a lot of work to do with this new approach, the potential is clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Due to drawbacks associated with injectable vaccines, such as pain and needle phobia, potential transmission of blood-borne pathogens from unsafe injection practices and the limited activation of mucosal immunity, there is a need for alternative approaches for vaccine delivery," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01451-3"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01451-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But if you’re munching on the wrong stuff every day, you could be stressing them out big time without even realizing it. Kidney health isn’t just about avoiding alcohol or salty snacks once in a while — it’s about what’s quietly adding up on your plate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some everyday favorites might be silently working against your kidney function. The scary part? You don’t need to have kidney disease for damage to start. In fact, your kidneys can be under pressure long before any symptoms show up. So if you’re serious about preventing kidney damage or just want to be more mindful of your diet, here are the worst offenders hiding in plain sight — and what to eat instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Salty processed &amp;amp; packaged foods&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salt is public enemy #1 when it comes to kidney health. The &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/healthy-eating/diabetes-and-kidney-disease-food.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;US CDC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; slams high-salt foods, especially the “invisible” salt hiding out in canned soups, frozen dinners, chips, crackers, processed meats (like deli turkey, bacon), restaurant meals, and even sauces and salad dressings. Why? Too much sodium makes your kidneys retain water, raises your blood pressure, and speeds up kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skip those “convenience” and restaurant meals when you can.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always eyeball the nutrition facts label—the lower the sodium, the better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experiment with herbs, lemon, or vinegar for flavor. Hold the salt shaker!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sugary drinks &amp;amp; colas&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You guessed it, sugary sodas (especially “dark” colas) are rough on the kidneys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only do they contribute to obesity and diabetes (major kidney killers), but colas also sneak in a double whammy with high phosphorus content, which weak kidneys can’t process well. Too much phosphorus ends up damaging blood vessels and bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprise sources:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dark colas and some flavored waters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sweetened iced teas and energy drinks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose plain water or unsweetened alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you must have a soda, switch to clear, caffeine-free versions now and then.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fast food &amp;amp; packaged dinners&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one stings, right? Burgers, fries, pizza, and instant noodles are the trifecta of trouble: loaded with sodium, saturated fat, and often sky-high in both phosphorus and potassium (another mineral that can pile up in your blood if kidneys aren’t healthy).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limit fast food outings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you do indulge, ask for food with “no added salt” and avoid extra cheese or sauces.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;High-phosphorus foods&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phosphorus is an unsung villain for kidneys—if your body can’t clear it, it’ll steal calcium from your bones and tangle with your heart health. High-phosphorus foods aren’t just colas, but also:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Processed cheese and dairy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beans, nuts, whole grain breads, and many &lt;keyword id="20490015" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="processed-foods" source="keywords"&gt;processed foods&lt;/keyword&gt; with “phos-” on the ingredient list.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;High-protein animal foods&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meat-lovers, beware: eating tons of red meat, poultry, eggs, and cheese loads your body with protein that your kidneys need to filter out. Over time, excess protein makes kidneys work overtime, which is rough if you already have kidney risk factors or early CKD. Yes, you need protein, but not more than your body can use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potassium bombs&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, potassium is awesome! But when the kidneys are struggling, they can’t balance it, leading to muscle and heart problems. Foods like bananas, oranges, potatoes, tomatoes, avocados, and even some “whole wheat” breads are sneaky sources of potassium that could tip the scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ultra-processed foods&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything that’s boxed, bagged, or “ready in minutes” probably contains a cocktail of sodium, phosphorus, unhealthy fats, and advanced glycation end products (AGEs)—chemicals formed during high-temperature cooking and linked to kidney damage in multiple studies. The more ultra-processed foods you eat, the higher your risk for kidney trouble—even if you’re otherwise healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This information is for educational purposes only and is not medical advice.

We will ensure that those most in need will receive treatment first.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;About 220,000 people in England are due to be offered tirzepatide, a diabetes drug that promotes weight loss, over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Pharmacies already provide about 85% of all weight loss drugs and need to be closely involved in the expansion of access, Picard added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The government should use the massive untapped expertise and skills of pharmacists to help speed up the NHS’s weight loss medication programme to millions of the most in need patients,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxNVmVJUC1jcFY5UzdJMWkxSGplZ0hTWmx6RVRtb3c1SERQUWM1OHJVemxTcEstYWZCcVJ5T3hValRwX1FJa2Y5dFBFWFFRUUhSbzR1UXFaWUowMW1YSEJKMEk3UGRLeFNhdTZrU3pJUzQ4UF91Y2pBN3JoY1NEdFd3QzRtcUs1eWhZUzVpRHBaOFBhM0xOLU1sOW5TMzBUeDdjbVNVSFN6TTJEY0xNWm9DOVduRzZfZkZYN0E</guid></item><item><title>前列腺癌： 7个可能延迟男性癌症诊断的神话-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to men’s health, prostate cancer tends to fly under the radar—until it doesn’t. Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in American men, second only to skin cancer. And yet, myths and misunderstandings still cloud how we talk about it, test for it, and treat it. From the idea that it only affects "older guys" to the belief that early signs of prostate cancer always come with obvious symptoms (spoiler: they usually don’t), misinformation can be dangerous. Worse, it often leads to delays in diagnosis and prostate cancer treatment—and time matters when dealing with any cancer. Whether you're in your 40s or your 70s, knowing the facts about prostate health is just smart self-care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Prostate Cancer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prostate cancer starts in the prostate gland, a small, walnut-sized part of the male reproductive system that sits just below the bladder. But sometimes, the cells in the prostate start growing out of control. That’s when cancer kicks in. The tricky part is that prostate cancer symptoms often don’t show up early. Most guys feel totally fine, no pain, no warning signs, nothing. That’s why regular prostate cancer screening, including PSA tests and yes, the digital rectal exam, matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In many cases, prostate cancer is highly treatable, especially when caught early. But if left undetected, it can spread to bones, lymph nodes, and other areas. That’s why keeping tabs on your prostate health, especially after age 50, is a game-changer. Think of it as part of long-term men’s cancer awareness—your future self will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Prostate Cancer Guide: Expert Reveals Causes and Prevention Strategies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth: “If I don’t have symptoms, I don’t have prostate cancer.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry, wish it were true! The sneaky thing about prostate cancer is that in the early stages, it usually has no symptoms at all. Nope, not even a twinge or a peep. When symptoms like trouble peeing or back pain do pop up, it usually means the cancer has already advanced. That’s why screening and talking to your doc (even when you feel perfectly fine) is so important, especially if you’re over 50, African-American, or have a family history of prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth: “Only old men get prostate cancer.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, risk increases as you get older—most cases happen in men over 65. But younger men can and do get prostate cancer, sometimes even in their forties or fifties. Bottom line: age is a big risk factor, but it’s not a guarantee. No matter your age, be aware of your personal risk and talk it over with your health provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth: “If my dad had it, I’m doomed.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a father (or brother) with prostate cancer definitely bumps up your risk—about double, in fact. But it’s not destiny; plenty of men with a strong family history never get prostate cancer. And on the flip side, about 90% of prostate cancers pop up in men with no family history at all. Your family history is important to know, but it’s not a crystal ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth: “Screenings and PSA tests are pointless (or will always lead to unnecessary treatment).”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screening is controversial, but it’s not pointless! The PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood test can catch cancer before symptoms show up, but it’s not foolproof. Some cancers are slow, harmless guests; others need action, fast. If you have an elevated PSA, that’s just one piece of the puzzle, not an automatic cancer diagnosis or reason to rush into treatment. Decisions should always be personal, based on your age, health, and family history—and in conversation with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth: “If I have prostate cancer, I need treatment right now.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all prostate cancers are aggressive or dangerous. Some are so slow-growing that your doctor may recommend “active surveillance”—keep an eye on things with regular tests and only step in if the situation changes. For many men, avoiding or delaying treatment means fewer side effects, while still staying safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth: “Treatments always ruin your sex life and cause incontinence.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatments can have side effects, including trouble with erections and urinary issues—you’ve probably heard this a lot. But not every guy who gets treated ends up with long-term problems. Side effects depend on many factors: your age, the specific treatment, and even the experience of your healthcare team. Plus, treatments and support to help manage side effects are better than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth: “If you don’t eat sugar or take special vitamins, you won’t get prostate cancer.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s clear the air: eating sugar doesn’t cause prostate cancer, and there’s no magic diet or supplement that can prevent it. Obesity is linked to a higher risk of several cancers, including prostate, so eating healthy matters, but skipping sugar or popping vitamins won’t give you a get-out-of-cancer card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 01:22:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>即使没有更多的饮酒，重度饮酒者中也会出现严重的肝病-西雅图时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxOVnE4M0dKTWIyOXNlaXd4NzhueFlrSC1oa2YxclBlYjhCOUhnWGZKZGtjeFN5ZlkyU0hnMlVObVAtSDJDTHdxMmZOMjJBZUZmOFJFbkJaQ25uSDhjek9IcVJhLUJPMVFzRzEwNUNnOW5zakNucFdOcTRNTDZzLVJXTjdaRUpXSXlQOEJmM09tYm16d1R6VFZ6aEZCdzZaOWFIMHY3aEk4dW00Mk9QQlZlVkd5Z1dGOWxXQ0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxOVnE4M0dKTWIyOXNlaXd4NzhueFlrSC1oa2YxclBlYjhCOUhnWGZKZGtjeFN5ZlkyU0hnMlVObVAtSDJDTHdxMmZOMjJBZUZmOFJFbkJaQ25uSDhjek9IcVJhLUJPMVFzRzEwNUNnOW5zakNucFdOcTRNTDZzLVJXTjdaRUpXSXlQOEJmM09tYm16d1R6VFZ6aEZCdzZaOWFIMHY3aEk4dW00Mk9QQlZlVkd5Z1dGOWxXQ0E?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Serious liver disease is up among heavy drinkers, even without more drinking&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/stories/CAAqNggKIjBDQklTSGpvSmMzUnZjbmt0TXpZd1NoRUtEd2lLaGRIbERoR21yN19scGtpZnF5Z0FQAQ?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US:en&amp;amp;oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;View Full Coverage on Google News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 01:02:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxOVnE4M0dKTWIyOXNlaXd4NzhueFlrSC1oa2YxclBlYjhCOUhnWGZKZGtjeFN5ZlkyU0hnMlVObVAtSDJDTHdxMmZOMjJBZUZmOFJFbkJaQ25uSDhjek9IcVJhLUJPMVFzRzEwNUNnOW5zakNucFdOcTRNTDZzLVJXTjdaRUpXSXlQOEJmM09tYm16d1R6VFZ6aEZCdzZaOWFIMHY3aEk4dW00Mk9QQlZlVkd5Z1dGOWxXQ0E</guid></item><item><title>女儿透露，在假期中从小狗身上死于狂犬病的英国母亲“可怕”死亡-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The daughter of a British woman who died of rabies after she was &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-14827919/British-mother-killed-rabies-video-dancing-stray-dog-Morocco.html"&gt;scratched by a puppy&lt;/a&gt; on holiday has spoken of her mother's 'horrendous' death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yvonne Ford, 59, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was scratched on the leg by a small stray puppy lying under her sunbed while on holiday in Morocco with her husband in February - but thought nothing of it at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many months later, the grandmother-of-four started suffering from a 'horrendous' headache and was admitted to Barnsley Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within days, she could not walk, talk, sleep or swallow.

She was hallucinating and had a fear of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She couldn't swallow. She was choking on her own saliva.

An estimated 60,000 to 100,000 Americans die from blood clot complications annually, making this an important health issue to be aware of. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Awareness of blood clot symptoms is critically important because early recognition can be life-saving,” says&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/jonathan-parsons-md-4884" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Jonathan Parsons, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Jonathan Parsons, MD&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; a pulmonologist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. “Recognizing symptoms early allows for prompt medical treatment.” That can help lower the risk of permanent damage to organs or tissues, he points out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here’s the problem: Not all symptoms of blood clots are obvious, and one in particular can be easily mistaken for other, much less severe health issues. Here’s what doctors want you to keep in mind about this symptom, why it can be confused with other things and when to take action. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/stethoscope" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🩺;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;🩺&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/healthy-now" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/pill" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:💊;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;💊&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Do Serious Blood Clots Happen?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we go over the symptom, it’s important to first go over how blood clots can become serious. Blood clots that happen spontaneously usually start in the legs, explains &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/christopher-e-yi" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Christopher Yi, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Christopher Yi, MD&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; a vascular surgeon at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California. “They aren’t life-threatening in themselves, but they occasionally dislodge and go to the lungs,” he says. This is called a pulmonary embolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/worst-habit-for-a1c-levels-according-to-endocrinologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Got High A1C Levels? Stop Doing This One Thing ASAP;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Got High A1C Levels? Stop Doing This One Thing ASAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a pulmonary embolism, a blood clot gets stuck in an artery in the lung and blocks blood flow to part of the lung, Dr. Yi explains. There, it can cause permanent damage to the lungs, low oxygen levels in your blood, and damage to other organs in your body (from not getting enough oxygen), he says, adding, “This can be life-threatening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Silent Sign of Blood Clots To Know About, According to a Vascular Surgeon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to that silent symptom: Shortness of breath is common with pulmonary embolisms. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Shortness of breath is a hallmark symptom of pulmonary embolism because of how the condition affects the lungs and oxygen delivery,” Dr. Parson says. “The blocked artery prevents blood from reaching parts of the lung, so oxygen can't be absorbed into the bloodstream efficiently, resulting in shortness of breath.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This blockage usually comes on suddenly, so the body doesn’t have time to compensate for the lower-than-usual oxygen, he explains. That can lead to sudden and intense shortness of breath. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/best-packaged-foods-for-heart-health-according-to-cardiologist" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:'I'm a Cardiologist, and These Are the 2 Packaged Snacks I Swear By for Heart Health';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;'I'm a Cardiologist, and These Are the 2 Packaged Snacks I Swear By for Heart Health'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Shortness of Breath Is a Sign of a Blood Clot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortness of breath can also be a sign of a slew of other things, including being out of shape, having asthma or just having a cold, making this a tricky thing to pin on a blood clot. But doctors say there are a few key differences between “regular” shortness of breath and feeling breathless due to a blood clot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Standard shortness of breath usually comes with exercise or activity,” Dr. Yi says. “With a blood clot, there is a sudden onset of shortness of breath where you feel like you can’t catch your breath.” You may also start breathing faster than usual, he explains. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along with coming on hard and fast, shortness of breath from a blood clot tends to get worse with exertion or taking deep breaths, according to Dr. Parson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1264350/jenniferlarson/what-does-an-asthma-attack-feel-like/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:‘An Elephant on Your Chest’ and ‘Being Trapped Under a Heavy Piece of Furniture’—Here’s What an Asthma Attack Actually Feels Like;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;‘An Elephant on Your Chest’ and ‘Being Trapped Under a Heavy Piece of Furniture’—Here’s What an Asthma Attack Actually Feels Like&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Signs of a Blood Clot and What To Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While sudden shortness of breath alone should raise concerns about a possible pulmonary embolism, there are other blood clot symptoms doctors warn should be on your radar:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast breathing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chest pain (it usually gets worse when you cough or take a deep breath)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A faster-than-usual heart rate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coughing, including coughing up blood&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very low blood pressure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling lightheaded&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fainting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be tempting to write these signs off if you have one or two that can be explained away as something more minor. But doctors stress the importance of taking these seriously if you or someone around you has them. “If someone experiences these symptoms, immediate medical attention is critical,” Dr. Parsons says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/everyday-activity-thats-good-for-your-core-according-to-trainers" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: Trainers Say This Everyday Activity Is Secretly Amazing for Your Core;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: Trainers Say This Everyday Activity Is Secretly Amazing for Your Core&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/silent-blood-clot-symptom-according-to-vascular-surgeon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Silent Symptom That Could Be a Sign of Blood Clots;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Silent Symptom That Could Be a Sign of Blood Clots&lt;/a&gt; first appeared on Parade on Jul 27, 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally reported by &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/silent-blood-clot-symptom-according-to-vascular-surgeon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt; on Jul 27, 2025, where it first appeared.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 20:48:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBLU0tUeUp5MHZ0M2JORXdxek5FdjFtN2dUSk1KRjJKUHFhMkRJd2NWTnNJTVNGQWw5bUEwQ1B5U3Fnbjk0bHlOY1A1QWEtMHo1X083MVFJeTNtbV9hMGlCYUpfa1NVcUJpSHFLaFVXLWQ5SEpq</guid></item><item><title>人类大脑在疫情中迅速老化，不仅仅是病毒- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxPUk9GX1BCemxQY2NhTWJyb3g3Ykh4ZDlFQ1pQeFNQSWltSE5hV3ZQckRpSHJud2tpUmp6STZoRjhDWE5UbkZLR2JlcUZYVlQ0LTFPWndLMjd6S1RPdFVFbFVidDd2cUNDVlpLRldFUXd0UGE0bTl6cTU0eXpIM1pWN0xwYlRxTW96UlVDYk5IVzEwRko4TDhGekJnSUpGYnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic may have left a significant mark on our brains, even if we didn't get sick.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/severe-covid-looks-scarily-like-old-age-in-the-human-brain-study-finds"&gt;Fatal cases&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19 look scarily like old age &lt;/span&gt;in the brain&lt;span&gt;, and now, new research suggests that the mental, social, and financial stresses of the pandemic may have aged our brains as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A team led by researchers at the University of Nottingham trained an AI model to recognize healthy aging in the brain, using the data of more than 15,000 adults in the UK Biobank. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The algorithm was then used to analyze the brain ages of two groups: one that had brain scans taken before the pandemic and another that had brain scans taken both before and during the pandemic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-brains-youthfulness-or-lack-of-it-could-predict-how-long-you-live?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Your Brain's Youthfulness (or Lack of It) Could Predict How Long You Live&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;During the pandemic, the average human brain aged five and a half months faster than it did before 2020.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"What surprised me most was that even people who hadn't had COVID showed significant increases in brain aging rates," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age"&gt;&lt;span&gt;says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; neurologist Ali-Reza Mohammadi-Nejad from Nottingham, who led the study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It really shows how much the experience of the pandemic itself, everything from isolation to uncertainty, may have affected our brain health."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The good news is that those changes may be reversible. The study only analyzed brain scans from two time points, which means that there may have been neurological recovery in the years that followed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We can't yet test whether the changes we saw will reverse, but it's certainly possible, and that's an encouraging thought," &lt;a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Dorothee Auer from Nottingham.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What's more, just because a person's brain may have aged at a faster rate during the pandemic, doesn't mean their cognitive function was necessarily impacted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In fact, the only individuals in the study who showed decreased cognitive performance were those who were directly infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Still, the findings suggest that a major life event like a pandemic can have a significant impact on the brain, even if you don't get sick.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the first few years of the global pandemic, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/05/05/who-nearly-15-million-died-as-a-result-of-covid-19-in-first-two-years-of-pandemic/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;millions of humans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; died, and billions more dealt with a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/more-than-death-covid-has-unleashed-a-tidal-wave-of-grief-on-america"&gt;&lt;span&gt;tidal wave of grief&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/it-s-okay-to-feel-lonely-right-now-here-s-how-to-recognise-the-symptoms"&gt;&lt;span&gt;loneliness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/02-03-2022-covid-19-pandemic-triggers-25-increase-in-prevalence-of-anxiety-and-depression-worldwide"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/feeling-stressed-before-you-get-covid-may-increase-your-odds-of-developing-long-covid"&gt;&lt;span&gt;anxiety&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic-depression-has-persisted-even-after-lockdowns-have-eased"&gt;&lt;span&gt;financial stress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/covid-is-doing-something-to-our-sleep-and-even-to-our-dreams"&gt;&lt;span&gt;sleep disturbances&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Initial research found teenagers were particularly affected by the global crisis, with the adolescent brain &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lockdowns-did-something-to-teen-brains-and-we-need-to-talk-about-it"&gt;&lt;span&gt;showing concerning signs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of accelerated aging after 2020,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-brains-of-teenagers-look-disturbingly-different-after-lockdown"&gt;&lt;span&gt;similar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to&lt;span&gt; teens experiencing violence, neglect, or family dysfunction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168917" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168917" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/cortical-thinning-brain-scans.jpg" alt="Corticol Thinning" class="size-full wp-image-168917" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/cortical-thinning-brain-scans.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/cortical-thinning-brain-scans-600x326.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168917" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Brain scans show accelerated brain maturation in teenagers following the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="168905" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="168905" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, with more pronounced effects visible in female subjects.

But the current study among adults found that male brains were more vulnerable to both grey and white matter changes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Signs of accelerated aging were also particularly evident among older people and among socially or economically disadvantaged groups.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/social-isolation-actually-changes-our-brain-structure-neuroimaging-reveals"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that social isolation can change the structure of the brain, and poverty is also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/poverty-may-accelerate-brain-aging-study-shows"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to accelerated brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both could be factors leading to structural changes in the brain, but it's important to remain cautious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweeping, long-term studies using brain scans can provide scientists with useful clues as to how major life events, like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brains-scans-reveal-a-massive-surge-of-connectivity-when-babies-are-born"&gt;birth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/having-kids-linked-to-younger-looking-brains-later-in-life-study-finds"&gt;parenthood&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discovered-structural-brain-wide-changes-during-menstruation"&gt;menstruation&lt;/a&gt;, might be impacting our central nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But without closer research, it's impossible&lt;span&gt; to say why these brain regions are changing, or what impact the changes might have on cognitive function, or our behavior.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This study reminds us that brain health is shaped not only by illness, but by our everyday environment," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age"&gt;&lt;span&gt;concludes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;Auer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The pandemic put a strain on people's lives, especially those already facing disadvantage."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-61033-4"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chia seeds are rich in fiber, omega-3s, and antioxidants, offering many heart and digestive health benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They may interact with medications for blood pressure, diabetes, and clotting by amplifying their effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talk to your health care professional before adding chia to your diet if you're on meds, and start with small amounts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Despite their tiny size, chia seeds pack a powerful, nutrient-rich punch. They provide a boost of vitamins, minerals, healthy fat and fiber to whatever food they’re paired with—whether in a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8056553/chia-seed-recipes-that-arent-pudding/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;smoothie bowl&lt;/a&gt;, pancakes or oatmeal bars.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s because chia provides a good plant source of polyunsaturated fatty acids, including &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, which may help reduce blood pressure, improve cholesterol levels and quash inflammation, among many other benefits. Chia seeds are also a good source of antioxidants, which protect against cellular damage linked to chronic disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are also high in soluble fiber and form a gel-like substance when they come in contact with liquid—that’s why &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/268739/berry-chia-pudding/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chia seed pudding&lt;/a&gt; is so creamy. Due to their fiber content—1 ounce contains 10 grams of fiber—chia seeds may help increase satiety, lower LDL cholesterol and improve regularity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But these tiny seeds have a bit of a sinister secret: Despite being as good-for-you as they are, chia seeds may also interact with certain medications, affecting their potency and effectiveness.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The antioxidants and peptides found in chia seeds may help act like a natural ACE inhibitor (a common class of blood-pressure-lowering drugs) to decrease blood pressure and promote heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s a perk on its own, but eating chia seeds while taking antihypertensive medications could decrease your blood pressure more than expected. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds may have antiplatelet properties, which prevent clots from entering the bloodstream.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Good news for reducing your risk for heart attack and stroke, but this can be too much if you’re also being treated with blood thinners, which may increase the risk for bleeding. “If you are taking an anticoagulant or an antiplatelet, use caution,” says pharmacist &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronald-smith-jr-pharmd001/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Ronald Smith, Pharm.D., RPh&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Diabetes Medications &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are a smart choice if you’re &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7833638/foods-to-keep-blood-sugar-in-check/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;managing your blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, as their fiber helps slow down digestion. There’s evidence that chia may help reduce the rise in blood sugar that occurs after eating, and they may also have the potential to be used in diabetes treatment due to their antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
However, if you’re taking medication to treat diabetes, such as insulin, watch how your blood sugar responds to meals and snacks containing chia, since chia could lower your blood sugar too much. “If you’re new to chia seeds and are on insulin, consult your physician, as you may need to adjust your dosage,” says &lt;a href="https://www.freshmednyc.com/dr-robert-graham-integrative-medicine-nyc" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Robert Graham, M.D., M.P.H&lt;/a&gt;. a board-certified internal and integrative medicine physician and founder of Fresh Medicine.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, because chia seeds have potential blood-pressure-lowering, antiplatelet and blood-sugar-reducing properties, there may be additive effects between chia and the medications that treat these conditions. In other words, your blood pressure or blood sugar may dip too low when you combine the two.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In terms of medication absorption, it’s important to remember that chia is notably high in fiber. In some instances, you may get more fiber from eating chia than from taking a serving of a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-you-might-need-a-fiber-supplement-8678377" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber supplement&lt;/a&gt;, depending on how much chia you’re eating. And fiber can slow down the absorption of certain medications. If you routinely eat a lot of chia, ask your provider if you should space out the time between eating chia and taking your medications.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you are taking any of the above medications and want to incorporate chia seeds into your diet, there are a few things to consider.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; First and foremost, consult with your health care professional when making any significant dietary changes, including taking supplements. You can also talk to your local pharmacist about any food-medication interactions you might run into on your current prescriptions, over-the-counter medications or supplements. Don’t be shy about asking if chia seeds are safe for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have never eaten chia seeds before or haven't eaten them since starting any of the above medications, Graham recommends “starting low and going slow.” Consume a small amount of chia seed and gradually increase your intake to a level you can tolerate with no issues. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are a nutrient-packed food rich in omega-3s, fiber and antioxidants. They also may interact with some medications, specifically those prescribed for high blood pressure, other cardiovascular conditions (antiplatelets and anticoagulants) and diabetes. If you are being treated for those health conditions, it doesn’t necessarily mean you should avoid chia seeds. But talk to a health care professional about making chia seeds part of your diet; they may want to monitor you for any interactions or side effects.&lt;br&gt;

Researchers from the &lt;a href="https://www.ku.dk/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; revealed that everyone has their own unique response to insulin, challenging how the condition has traditionally been diagnosed and treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research takes a deep dive into the molecular makeup of muscle tissue and shows that insulin sensitivity isn’t as black and white as once believed. Instead, it's more like a spectrum—with distinct molecular fingerprints that could change the way we detect, predict, and manage diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="rethinking_a_global_health_crisis"&gt;Rethinking a Global Health Crisis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 500 million people live with type 2 diabetes around the world, according to the &lt;a href="https://diabetesatlas.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IDF Diabetes Atlas&lt;/a&gt;. The condition is often diagnosed by elevated blood sugar levels or poor responses to insulin. But now, thanks to new technology, scientists are realizing that the disease is far more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;The proteome and phosphoproteome of human skeletal muscle are critical determinants of whole-body insulin sensitivity (CREDIT: Cell) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Denmark, Sweden, and beyond worked together to examine the underlying differences in how people respond to insulin. Instead of just separating people into "healthy" or "diabetic," they found that individuals show a wide range of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-protein-discovery-could-replace-insulin-for-diabetics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;—even among those with similar diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found huge variation in insulin sensitivity, even among people considered healthy and among those diagnosed with type 2 diabetes," said Associate Professor Atul Deshmukh from the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research at the University of Copenhagen. "There are even some individuals living with type 2 diabetes who respond better to insulin than healthy individuals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that your body’s insulin response is much more personal than we thought. And this variation could explain why some people develop complications while others do not—even if they share the same diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="studying_muscle_at_the_molecular_level"&gt;Studying Muscle at the Molecular Level&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reach these findings, the researchers looked closely at muscle tissue, a key site for insulin activity. Using a technology called mass spectrometry-based proteomics, they studied over 120 people. This allowed them to examine thousands of proteins and phosphorylation sites in &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-mechanical-pump-regenerates-heart-muscle-at-6x-the-normal-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;skeletal muscle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They focused on two groups: one with type 2 diabetes and another with normal &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/zinc-levels-linked-to-type-2-diabetes-risk-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;glucose levels&lt;/a&gt;. Each group underwent detailed testing, including the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp—the gold standard method for measuring insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found striking results. Some people with type 2 diabetes showed better insulin sensitivity than those considered healthy. This was true even after accounting for factors like fasting glucose and HbA1c, common blood sugar markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Proteomic signature of insulin-sensitive and -resistant skeletal muscle (CREDIT: Cell) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of finding clear-cut differences, the study revealed a 36-fold range in insulin sensitivity. In simple terms, no two bodies responded to insulin the same way. Even within the diabetic group, the range was massive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make sense of this, researchers analyzed protein and phosphoprotein levels in &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/researchers-harness-the-power-of-bacteria-to-regenerate-muscle-tissue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle tissue&lt;/a&gt;. They discovered that the molecular landscape of skeletal muscle plays a huge role in how your body handles insulin. Certain proteins consistently matched higher or lower insulin sensitivity. These changes could act as early warning signs long before symptoms arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="building_the_future_of_personalized_diabetes_care"&gt;Building the Future of Personalized Diabetes Care&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anna Krook, a professor at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and co-lead author, believes these results lay the groundwork for personalized treatment. "By learning more about the molecular signatures of insulin resistance, we’re building the foundation for precision medicine in &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/widely-used-drug-for-type-2-diabetes-also-slows-down-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; tailored to each patient."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These so-called "molecular fingerprints" of insulin resistance not only predict how your body reacts to insulin, but they also help doctors understand which treatments might work best for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;The fasting phosphoproteome landscape is a critical determinant of IS (CREDIT: Cell) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeppe Kjærgaard Northcote, another researcher on the team, explained, "When we combine this deep &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-mobile-app-clinically-proven-to-treat-tinnitus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;clinical data&lt;/a&gt; with the molecular signatures of insulin resistance, we suddenly understand a lot more about people’s insulin resistance that we can use to design precision medicine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data showed that one protein, BDH1, had a strong positive link to insulin sensitivity. Another protein, HSPA2, showed the opposite. These patterns remained steady across both men and women, even though male and female &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-class-of-drugs-target-brain-metabolism-to-treat-alzheimers-patients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt; can differ in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="taking_a_closer_look_at_the_science"&gt;Taking a Closer Look at the Science&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To perform this study, researchers developed a high-throughput method to prepare tissue samples. Using advanced technology, they ran nearly 500 tests to examine protein levels in muscle. They found more than 29,000 phosphorylation sites across 3,000 proteins—an impressive level of detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that insulin resistance is not just about how much insulin you produce or how much glucose you absorb. It’s about the specific proteins in your muscle cells and how they behave. These &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-discover-natural-antibiotics-hidden-within-human-proteins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;proteins&lt;/a&gt; are shaped by both your genetics and your environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Preserved and dysregulated insulin signaling across states of insulin resistance (CREDIT: Cell) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the researchers found that these protein patterns were better at predicting insulin sensitivity than traditional blood tests like fasting glucose or HbA1c. Even in a fasting state, the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/first-ever-study-identifies-the-mechanisms-behind-learning-memory-and-alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;proteomic data&lt;/a&gt; strongly reflected how a person would respond to insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="20" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that the standard clinical tests might miss early signs of insulin resistance. In contrast, muscle proteins could reveal what’s going on under the surface much sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="21" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another powerful part of this study was the use of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/machine-learning-can-identify-mild-cognitive-impairment-from-retinal-scans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt;. By feeding the protein data into a Random Forest model, the team could accurately predict insulin resistance. The model was even more precise than simply grouping people by whether or not they had diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="22" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Principal component analysis further showed that insulin resistance follows a spectrum. People don't fall into just two categories. Instead, they scatter along a wide range of sensitivity, and this variation shows up clearly in the molecular data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;The sex-specific molecular signature reveals shared and distinct features of metabolism (CREDIT: Cell) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_road_ahead"&gt;The Road Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="23" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists hope this research will inspire a shift in how doctors approach type 2 diabetes. Instead of waiting for blood sugar levels to rise or symptoms to appear, doctors might one day use molecular signatures to detect insulin resistance early on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="24" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could lead to better treatment strategies. People could receive therapies based on their own &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/researchers-discover-the-largest-protein-ever-found-in-biology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;biology&lt;/a&gt;, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="25" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the research is still in its early stages, it already shows great promise.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oats are the No. 1 whole grain for better gut health, according to a gastroenterologist.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole grains like oats pack important nutrients like dietary fiber, protein, vitamins and minerals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oats benefit your gut by acting as a prebiotic, supporting immune health and increasing satiety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whole grains are the MVP of the carbohydrate family. They pack important nutrients like dietary fiber, protein, vitamins and minerals that play an important role in a healthy diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Whole grains are well known for their &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/15297/our-top-15-heart-healthy-foods/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart-health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, but they provide a host of benefits for our gut, too.

Based on this data, I would say all whole grains are a great choice, but if I had to choose one, I would choose oats.”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Read on to find out why oats top the charts as the No. 1 whole grain to include in your diet for better gut health.

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Support Good Gut Bugs   &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the top reasons oats are such a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-plant-based-foods-for-gut-health-8716725" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;phenomenal food for gut health&lt;/a&gt;, according to Schopis—they function as a prebiotic. Prebiotics are nonliving organisms that provide food for probiotics, those good bugs that live in your gut. Beta-glucan, a type of soluble fiber found in oats, contributes to the prebiotic function of oats. When fiber in oats is digested, it provides food for the probiotics in the microbiome, in turn supporting the functions they carry out.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Improve Gut-Brain Communication &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your mood is highly connected to the health of the microbiome, thanks to the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8001367/poor-gut-health-increases-anxiety-depression-risk-what-to-eat/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut-brain axis&lt;/a&gt;. Feeling off? The pickup you need could be found through feeding your gut. In fact, research suggests that the increase in short-chain fatty acids that are produced through the breakdown of dietary fiber may play a role in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8018711/gut-bacteria-risk-for-depression-new-study/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;improving mood and disorders&lt;/a&gt; of the central nervous system.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When SCFAs are produced, they support the intricately connected nervous, immune and endocrine systems that work together to keep you healthy, especially when exposed to stressors. Through this action, SCFAs also provide support for the blood-brain barrier, protecting the brain from harmful substances while simultaneously influencing mood.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/author/natalie-rizzo/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Natalie Rizzo, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, shares, “An important step in supporting a better mood is focusing on feeding your gut. Simple foods, like whole-grain oats, are an easy way to improve your mood and energy levels, in turn supporting a healthier you.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Offer Support for Immune Health  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A large portion of your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/288067/3-surprising-reasons-your-gut-health-matters/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;immune system is housed within the microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, which means supporting gut health may be your ticket to fewer sick days. A recent scientific review explored the research on oats and immune health and found the wide variety of compounds found in oats— including dietary fiber, copper, iron, selenium and zinc—offered pretty impressive benefits when it came to immune health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Additionally, the phytonutrients found in oats have &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027728/best-budget-friendly-antioxidant-rich-foods/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;antioxidant properties&lt;/a&gt; that help scavenge free radicals (those bad guys that can make you sick over time). Rizzo writes, “Eating oats supports a healthy microbiome that can adapt to changes (like the annual cold and flu season) and keep you functioning at your prime.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber is a key factor that influences satiety, or the fullness factor that comes with eating.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Foods like oats that are high in fiber take longer to digest, meaning they offer more staying power and keep you fuller for longer. &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannahspencerrdn/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Hannah Ackermann, RD,&lt;/a&gt; writes, “Unlike refined carbs, the fiber in whole grains isn’t broken down in your small intestine. Hours later, it reaches your large intestine, where beneficial gut bacteria ferment it. This delayed release of hormones several hours after eating whole grains is known as the “second meal effect.” Fiber in whole grains provides a lasting sense of satisfaction, helping you manage hunger more effectively throughout the day.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While diet certainly plays an important role in your gut health, so does how you move your body, your stress levels and more. Consider these tips to support better gut health, too: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-helped-me-eat-more-fiber-11775341" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;variety-filled, high-fiber diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Schopis’ best advice: “Consume a diet high in different fibers, which includes whole grains, veggies, fruits, nuts and legumes. Diverse, high-fiber diets have been shown to increase the amount of beneficial gut bacteria and improve metabolic health.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you’re not sure where to begin, start with the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/16372/8-ways-to-follow-the-mediterranean-diet-for-better-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, he suggests.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit highly processed foods. &lt;/strong&gt;Not all foods are created equally, even those with fancy marketing slogans. “Focus on eating a variety of foods that are rich in fiber first and foremost, and limited in added sugars, salt and preservatives,” writes Rizzo. This doesn’t mean you can’t rely on convenience foods, like flash-frozen fruits and vegetables or canned beans. Those are A-listers on a diet to support better gut health. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorporate regular movement.&lt;/strong&gt; Movement is a star player in keeping your gut happy, healthy and regular. Rizzo encourages clients to find a form of movement they enjoy and fit it in routinely. She writes, “Daily movement is key to keeping your gut healthy and mood balanced. Whether it’s a run, walk or yoga class, find what you love and do it daily.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291942/exactly-how-much-nature-time-you-need-to-reap-the-physical-and-mental-benefits/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;daily stress-reduction strategies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; High stress levels can negatively impact your gut health. Finding a moment to unwind daily is key to managing your cortisol levels and improving your gut health. Rizzo shares, “Stress management shouldn’t stress you out. Find something that feels natural and doable and fit it in daily. For many of my runners, this is even a 10-minute mobility break where they can stretch and breathe all at once.”&lt;/li&gt;

None of them, she felt, truly listened or &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13620287/doctors-gaslighting-dismissing-womens-pain.html"&gt;took her symptoms seriously&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In August 2015, after a year of asking doctors to order her an MRI, one of them finally listened, and what appeared on the scan changed the course of her life entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the emergency room, doctors informed her that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14738375/Doctors-dismissed-dizzy-spells-swimmers-ear-cancer.html"&gt;she had a tumor&lt;/a&gt; called a meningioma the size of an apple pressing on the left side of her brain so forcefully that both hemispheres were being pushed to the right side of her skull. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While not classified as &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-9f2d4790-68a6-11f0-8228-d723bca0d5ae"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, meningiomas can be deadly if complications arise, boasting a mortality rate of anywhere from 63 to 90 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She underwent multiple surgeries to seal off the blood vessel feeding the tumor in the hopes of preventing it from growing larger, followed by a procedure to remove the mass in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It's only when I look back in time and think through those appointments and the conversations, and I was at the point where I was begging people to believe me,’ Ruhoy told DailyMail.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The sad part is that if someone had believed me earlier on, I think I could have prevented a lot of the recurrences that I had to go through because I've now undergone three rounds of radiation to my brain.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Ilene Ruhoy specializes in complex post-exposure illnesses such as long Covid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ruhoy was healthy before her medical crisis, like many of her current patients. She questioned how this could have happened, feeling she had done everything right. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During her quest for answers, Ruhoy complained of light sensitivity and severe, long-lasting migraines that doctors told her were due to her stressful job as a neurologist in a hospital.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said one doctor stayed glued to their computer and failed to even make eye contact with her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another told her, after she begged for an MRI because she knew something was  wrong, that he 'didn't want to feed into the hysteria by ordering an MRI.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said 'Looking back, I think that I just wasn't cognizant of what was really happening when it was happening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And it's only when I look back in time and think through those appointments and basically I was at the point where I was like begging people to believe me, because things just were getting worse for me.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around nine months into her illness, before being diagnosed, she found a primary care doctor and as&lt;span&gt; soon as Ruhoy walked into her new doctor's office, she began to sob, telling the physician that she had reached her wit's end. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Many of Ruhoy's patients are on their fourth or fifth healthcare professional&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'All I said was, please, just order me an MRI. And she said the famous words, "when a neurologist asks you to order a brain MRI, you order a brain MRI,"' Ruhoy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I remember that moment when she just agreed and I almost hugged her. I didn't, I should have, but I was just so grateful, and I will always be grateful.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Ruhoy spoke to DailyMail.com about her new book published by St Martin's Publishing Group about treating complex chronic illnesses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ruhoy still does not know definitively what caused her own tumor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I have a PhD in environmental toxicology, so I've thought long and hard about this; what exposures have I had in my life, what infections have I had in my life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Once I was diagnosed, I underwent a big workup, led by myself, to try to answer that exact question, and I really came up with nothing. We don't really know what causes these tumors.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Inspired by her own journey, Ruhoy would come to specialize in complex post-exposure illnesses (PEIs), such as long Covid and chronic fatigue syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with poorly understood chronic illnesses fed by exposure to certain medications, pathogens, or trauma generally describe feeling 'gaslit' by their doctors who don't adequately listen to their concerns, often brush them off as being due to stress, give up trying to treat patients, and alienate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She vowed to help patients who have felt let down by the medical establishment and to not allow them to leave her office without setting forth on the path to recovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PEIs encompass several diagnoses marked by a wide array of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Ruhoy, exposure can be to anything external and does not always involve an infection. For instance, she said, long-term exposure to pesticides or mold have been linked to cases of Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, and chronic fatigue syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;At the emergency room, doctors informed her that she had a tumor called a meningioma the size of an apple pressing on the left side of her brain (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her newfound career treating PEIs began with Danielle, a dancer in her early 30s who developed debilitating joint pain, food allergies, hives, swelling in her hands and feet, dizziness, headaches, and neck pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many of her patients today are on their fourth or fifth healthcare professional in their quest to figure out what is driving their symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Danielle was no different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She asked Danielle a laundry list of questions, questions no doctor had asked her before: Did she ever have any pain disorders? Did family members have similar symptoms to hers? Did she choke a lot? Did she have chest pain?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A detailed blood test revealed Danielle's hypothyroidism, missed by other doctors who hadn't ordered a comprehensive panel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This likely caused her fatigue, menstrual issues, hair loss, bloating, and skin changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ruhoy addressed each symptom: an MRI uncovered a misdiagnosed spinal problem, treated with muscle relaxants; medication stabilized her dizziness; and specialists managed her heart and joint pain. Within months, Danielle felt significantly better.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to treating patients’ symptoms with medication, Ruhoy recommends drug-free treatments: being active, even for a short walk, time in nature, and following a consistent sleep schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Will you ever be “normal” again? It’s a question I hear often from patients, and unfortunately— if by “normal” you mean a full return to the person you were before this chronic illness... I can’t promise that you will,’ Ruhoy wrote in her book Invisible No More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘However, if you care for yourself, if you remain diligent in the ways we have discussed, and if you attend to your body and listen to the signals it sends you… then you have a great chance of being well. Very well, even.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

If so, it might be time to switch up your routine. That's because &lt;strong&gt;certain vitamins, especially if you’re deficient in them, may not absorb as well if they interact with some of the components in coffee.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/18/3155" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research shows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that coffee intake can increase vitamin D levels, while decreasing levels of zinc, calcium and vitamin B. And although coffee contains valuable polyphenol antioxidants like chlorogenic acid (CGA) that can help reduce your &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12168468/#s5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:risk of heart disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, these same compounds could negatively affect absorption of certain vitamins and minerals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The takeaway? Experts suggest&lt;strong&gt; capping your daily caffeine intake at 200 mg (about 2 cups of brewed coffee) to reap the most health benefits. &lt;/strong&gt;And regardless of daily caffeine intake, avoid taking &lt;strong&gt;the vitamins and minerals below within an hour of drinking coffee. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamins and minerals you shouldn't take with coffee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iron&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking coffee at the same time that you take your iron supplement can greatly reduce iron absorption. In fact, &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajh.26987" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a 2022 study from Switzerland;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a 2022 study from Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; showed that when iron deficient women took an iron supplement with coffee, iron absorption was decreased by 54% compared to taking it with water. The disruption of iron absorption stems from its interaction with the polyphenol and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11858154/#sec4-molecules-30-00800" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tannin antioxidants;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;tannin antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; in coffee. The good news is that &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2020/7909703" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a 2020 study shows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a 2020 study shows&lt;/a&gt; there was no decrease in iron absorption when coffee was consumed one or two hours &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; a meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.imrpress.com/journal/IJVNR/92/2/10.1024/0300-9831/a000727" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2021 study shows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2021 study shows&lt;/a&gt; that higher intakes of caffeine were linked with lower levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] — what's more commonly referred to as &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/vitamin-d-test/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;. It is suggested that caffeine, like that found in coffee, may interfere with vitamin D absorption by reducing the expression of vitamin D receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B Vitamins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The caffeine in coffee has a diuretic effect that can lead to increased excretion of water-soluble vitamins, including most B vitamins as well as vitamin C, before they are fully absorbed. On top of that, the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6160559/#:~:text=Some%20harmful%20effects%20have%20been,on%20the%20case%20(14)." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:polyphenols in coffee;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;polyphenols in coffee&lt;/a&gt; may also impact B vitamin absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calcium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since vitamin D is important in the absorption and use of calcium in building bone, drinking coffee may indirectly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7397437/#:~:text=As%20vitamin%20D%20is%20important,optimum%20pharmacological%20effect%20%5B14%5D." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reduce calcium absorption;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reduce calcium absorption&lt;/a&gt; a bit when consuming at the same time as your supplement. This is especially true for those who may already have low calcium or vitamin D levels, or those who are at risk for osteoporosis, such as the older adult population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to consume coffee and vitamins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re taking any vitamin or supplement on the list above, be sure to separate coffee consumption from your daily dosage of vitamins by at least an hour. But you may want to keep your morning coffee intact and instead change your supplement timing to later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“If possible, it’s best to eat breakfast first, or drink coffee with breakfast, so you’re not consuming coffee on an empty stomach which can irritate your stomach lining,&lt;/strong&gt; says &lt;a href="https://www.wowmd.com/pages/shelley-balls" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Shelley Balls, MDA, RDN, LDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Shelley Balls, MDA, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and nutritionist for &lt;a href="https://www.wowmd.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:WOWMD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;WOWMD&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Then, wait an hour or two to take your supplements.&lt;/strong&gt; “Limiting your intake of coffee to two cups per day can also help reduce nutrient absorption interference,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another option is to get a vitamin organizer and place the supplements that &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; interact with coffee in the daytime compartments and those that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; in the evening ones, when you are less likely to consume coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about tea?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like coffee, many types of tea also contain antioxidants and similar compounds found in coffee that may interfere with the absorption of certain vitamins and minerals. “Tea, especially black and green varieties, also contain tannins and caffeine, both of which can affect nutrient absorption," says &lt;a href="http://www.eatwelltobewellrd.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cheryl Mussatto MS, RD, LD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cheryl Mussatto MS, RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;, an Outpatient Clinical Dietitian at Cotton O'Neil Endocrinology and Diabetes Clinic in Topeka, Kansas. &lt;strong&gt;"While the impact may be slightly less than coffee depending on the type and amount, it’s still smart to avoid pairing tea with supplements like iron or calcium.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other ways to help absorb vitamins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides rescheduling your coffee consumption, there are other things you can do to optimize your vitamin and mineral absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat more nutrient-dense meals and snacks:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensure your vitamin and mineral intake is enough by increasing your intake of nutrients like calcium and iron through meals and snacks. Calcium is found in milk and milk-based items like yogurt, and cheese as well as fortified plant-based milk and juice, while good sources of iron include meat, poultry, fish, seafood as well as plant-based foods like beans, lentils, nuts and seeds. Consuming vitamin C with your iron-rich meals may help boost its absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay hydrated:&lt;/strong&gt; Since non-decaf coffee contains caffeine, which is a diuretic, it could contribute to fluid and mineral losses, especially to water-soluble vitamins like B vitamins and vitamin C. So, make sure you consume plenty of water and other low-calorie, decaffeinated drinks with each meal and snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit your healthcare provider:&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re worried your vitamin and mineral levels may be low, be sure to have your levels tested at least once a year. If you’re deficient in any vitamins and minerals, you can get a prescription for the necessary nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make the most of your vitamin routine without skipping your morning coffee, it’s all about the timing. &lt;strong&gt;Check your supplement labels for those nutrients where coffee components are most likely to interfere, and take these vitamins at least one hour from the time of your cup of Joe.&lt;/strong&gt; And if you’re still worried you’re not absorbing enough nutrients, simply add more nutrient-dense foods at meals and snacks and visit your doctor each year to test for your vitamin and mineral levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 13:58:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTFBlWTVfQ3dmOS1qWmJjNVZUdnFtcXB5UGQybUU0Q1FiLXV2NGNfSTVVa0xocG1WaGZIT3RVd1pNbHpHd3VieTZvWDJ5LWRhWjRJUHh0akFkOGNiSVJCU1puQVZjcmpOUEhHUm1hUVFxNEtXNFNFZmFhRw</guid></item><item><title>Benadryl对过敏缓解安全吗？了解它可能影响您大脑的令人震惊的方式|健康-印度斯坦时报-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/is-benadryl-safe-for-allergy-relief-know-the-shocking-ways-it-may-affect-brain-101753617874256.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Benadryl is often resorted to for bringing relief to allergy symptoms.

There are several concerns about negative side effects and even long-term &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/covid-19-infection-may-accelerate-brain-ageing-long-term-neurodegenerative-diseases-in-elderly-study-101659424611619.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="neurodegenerative disease"&gt;neurodegenerative disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why was Benadryl popular in the first place?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main reason it was popular before was because of its immediate effect on the &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/do-you-take-allergy-pills-before-hitting-the-gym-to-avoid-seasonal-sniffles-study-warns-you-may-want-to-think-twice-101750394338531.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="allergy"&gt;allergy&lt;/a&gt; symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Anna Wolfson, an allergist at Massachusetts General Hospital, spoke to the NYT and elaborated in the report, “This drug, whose generic name is diphenhydramine, provides almost immediate allergy relief. And with Benadryl around since the 1940s, it’s become the ‘Kleenex’ of antihistamines."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Benadryl has been around since the 1940s, as Dr Wolfson pointed out, indicating that it has been around so long, across generations even, that its presence became familiar. It’s what parents or grandparents may have used, which is why it continued to be trusted since the 20th century, till the time doubts were raised by the medical community.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Wolfson used the reference of Kleenex, which is a brand of tissue in the United States, but became synonymous with the product itself. In a similar analogy, Benadryl became synonymous with antihistamines, medications that stop allergy symptoms. So often, people think that is the only go-to for allergy control, not knowing there are other safer options available.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, as per Dr Wolfson, according to the report, Benadryl should only be used if it's the only option available. She used another interesting analogy of if someone is stranded on a deserted island and that's the only option available, then only should one use it, otherwise no. In most other situations, she said, there are safer and better alternatives to choose from.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What are the side effects?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/07/27/original/grogy_1_1753622554729.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Feeling groggy like hungover is one of the side effects.(Shutterstock)" title="Feeling groggy like hungover is one of the side effects.(Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Feeling groggy like hungover is one of the side effects.(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The side effects are alarming, acting as a wake-up call for the medical community to question Benadryl's safety. The majority of side effects are neurological, associated with the &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/acupuncturist-shares-3-dementia-preventing-hand-exercises-you-should-do-every-day-take-your-brain-to-the-gym-101753605044386.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="brain"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report stated that Benadryl belongs to an older class of antihistamines. It can enter the brain, crossing the blood-brain barrier and often leaving people feeling drowsy or mentally foggy. This leads to groginess and heightens the risk of falling, car accidents and even potential dementia. Explaining what goes on in the body during an allergy, the report described that bodies release a chemical called histamine to help fight the germs. But sometimes, harmless things like peanuts, dust or pollens also trigger the same response, like making you sneeze or cough. Here's where Antihistamines help in blocking this overreaction and relieving the symptoms of allergy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another expert, Dr Zachary Rubin, an Illinois-based allergist, weighed in on this subject of safety in the report, and noted, “Benadryl, ZzzQuil and other drugs with diphenhydramine can also make you drowsy, since histamine helps the brain stay alert.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Rubin further continued that the feeling is almost like being ‘knocked out,' impairing overall brain function temporarily. He said, “The feeling is more like being knocked out after having too much to drink, than deep, restorative sleep.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another expert, Dr David Stukus, seconded this in the report and added, “You have this lingering hangover effect.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The side effect is so dangerous that the European Union added it to the ‘do not drive’ list, and even pilots are not allowed to fly Benadryl even if they have taken it two to three days ago, showcasing how lasting and dangerous the side effects can be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How is Benadryl associated with dementia?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/12/17/original/shutterstock_2489919231_1734432409977.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="There's a potential risk of dementia from Benadryl.(Shutterstock)" title="There's a potential risk of dementia from Benadryl.(Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;There's a potential risk of dementia from Benadryl.(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;As per a 2015 &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2091745" target="_blank" class="backlink" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="study"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in JAMA Internal Medicine, long-term use of an acetylcholine-blocking drug is linked to a higher risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s, 54 per cent and 63 per cent, respectively. But according to the report, experts say this doesn’t directly prove that Benadryl causes dementia, although it does interfere with acetylcholine, a brain chemical essential for memory, focus, and learning. However, this study highlights the lasting consequence of Benadryl consumption on brain health. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Better to opt for safer options&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Wolfson clarified, “Occasional use is fine.” But when buying any antihistamines for allergies, she recommended opting for newer ones like cetirizine and fexofenadine, commonly known as Zyrtec and Allegra.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the report, another expert, Dr. Sarah Taylor-Black, an allergist at Dartmouth Health, added that these newer antihistamines don’t cross into the brain as much, making them a safer choice with fewer side effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

The new platform, BioMapAI, achieved 90% accuracy in identifying ME/CFS patients based on stool, blood, and symptom data—offering long-overdue validation for millions living with this debilitating illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that patients had distinct biological signatures, including lower levels of beneficial fatty acids, disrupted immune cell activity, and metabolic imbalances. These findings could guide personalized treatments and provide a scientific foundation for future therapies, especially for long COVID sufferers with overlapping symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Breakthrough:&lt;/strong&gt; BioMapAI distinguished ME/CFS patients with 90% accuracy using immune, microbiome, and metabolic data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological Signatures:&lt;/strong&gt; Patients showed disrupted tryptophan metabolism, inflammatory immune cells, and reduced butyrate levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precision Medicine Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may lead to targeted interventions for ME/CFS and long COVID.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Jackson Laboratory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Millions suffering from myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), a debilitating condition often overlooked due to the lack of diagnostic tools, may be closer to personalized care, according to new research that shows how the disease disrupts interactions between the microbiome, immune system, and metabolism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings—potentially relevant to long COVID due to its similarity with ME/CFS—come from data on 249 individuals analyzed using a new artificial intelligence (AI) platform that identifies disease biomarkers from stool, blood, and other routine lab tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111975"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/microbiome-chronic-fatigue-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/microbiome-chronic-fatigue-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/microbiome-chronic-fatigue-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/microbiome-chronic-fatigue-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/microbiome-chronic-fatigue-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/microbiome-chronic-fatigue-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/microbiome-chronic-fatigue-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/microbiome-chronic-fatigue-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows the biological route from the gut to the brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/microbiome-chronic-fatigue-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/microbiome-chronic-fatigue-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/microbiome-chronic-fatigue-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/microbiome-chronic-fatigue-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/microbiome-chronic-fatigue-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/microbiome-chronic-fatigue-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/microbiome-chronic-fatigue-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers intend to share their dataset broadly with BioMapAI, which supports analyses across diverse symptoms and diseases, effectively integrating multi-omics data that are difficult to replicate in animal models. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study achieved 90% accuracy in distinguishing individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome, which is significant because doctors currently lack reliable biomarkers for diagnosis,” said study author Dr. Derya Unutmaz, Professor in immunology at The Jackson Laboratory (JAX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some physicians doubt it as a real disease due to the absence of clear laboratory markers, sometimes attributing it to psychological factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was led by  Dr. Julia Oh, formerly at JAX and now a microbiologist and professor at Duke University, in collaboration with ME/CFS clinicians Lucinda Bateman and Suzanne Vernon of the Bateman Horne Center, and Unutmaz, who directs the JAX ME/CFS Collaborative Research Center. Details appear today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mapping the Invisible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by severe symptoms that significantly impair physical and mental activities, including persistent fatigue, sleep abnormalities, dizziness, and chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts often compare ME/CFS to long COVID, as both conditions frequently follow viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus. In the United States, ME/CFS affects between 836,000 and 3.3 million individuals— many undiagnosed—and costs the economy $18 to $51 billion annually due to healthcare expenditures and lost productivity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior studies have noted immune disruptions in ME/CFS, Unutmaz said. This new research builds upon those findings by investigating how the gut microbiome, its metabolites, and immune responses interact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team linked these connections to 12 classes of patient-reported symptoms, which were aggregated from hundreds of datapoints generated by patient health and lifestyle surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include sleep disturbances, headaches, fatigue, dizziness, and other symptoms the researchers  mapped in their entirety from microbiome changes to metabolites, immune responses, and clinical symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We integrated clinical symptoms with cutting-edge omics technologies to identify new biomarkers of ME/CFS,” Oh said. “Linking symptoms at this level is crucial, because ME/CFS is highly variable. Patients experience a wide range of symptoms that differ in severity and duration, and current methods can’t fully capture that complexity.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conduct the study, the researchers analyzed comprehensive data collected from the Bateman Horne Center, a leading ME/CFS, Long-Covid, and fibromyalgia research center in Salt Lake City, Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ruoyun Xiong, also a lead author on the study, developed a deep neural network model called BioMapAI. The tool integrates gut metagenomics, plasma metabolomics, immune cell profiles, blood test data, and clinical symptoms from 153 patients and 96 healthy individuals over four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immune cell analysis proved most accurate in predicting symptom severity, while microbiome data best predicted gastrointestinal, emotional, and sleep disturbances. The model connected thousands of patient data points, reconstructing symptoms such as pain and gastrointestinal issues, among several others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also revealed that patients who were ill for less than four years had fewer disrupted networks than those who were ill for more than  ten years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our data indicate these biological disruptions become more entrenched over time,” Unutmaz said. “That doesn’t mean longer-duration ME/CFS can’t be reversed, but it may be more challenging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 96 age- and gender-matched healthy controls, showing balanced microbiome-metabolite-immune interactions, in contrast to significant disruptions in ME/CFS patients linked to fatigue, pain, emotional regulation issues, and sleep disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ME/CFS patients also had lower levels of butyrate, a beneficial fatty acid produced in the gut, along with other nutrients essential for metabolism, inflammation control, and energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with elevated levels of tryptophan, benzoate, and other markers indicated a microbial imbalance. Heightened inflammatory responses, particularly involving MAIT cells sensitive to gut microbial health, were also observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“MAIT cells bridge gut health to broader immune functions, and their disruption alongside butyrate and tryptophan pathways, normally anti-inflammatory, suggests a profound imbalance,” said Unutmaz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Actionable Dataset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the findings require further validation, they significantly advance scientists’ understanding of ME/CFS and provide clearer hypotheses for future research, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since animal models can’t fully reflect the complex neurological, physiological, immune, and other system disruptions seen in ME/CFS, Oh said it will be crucial to study humans directly to identify modifiable factors and develop targeted treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The microbiome and metabolome are dynamic,” Oh said. “That means we may be able to intervene—through diet, lifestyle, or targeted therapies—in ways that genomic data alone can’t offer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BioMapAI also achieved roughly 80% accuracy in external data sets, confirming key biomarkers identified in the original group. This consistency across diverse data was striking, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Despite diverse data collection methods, common disease signatures emerged in fatty acids, immune markers, and metabolites,” Oh said. “That tells us this is not random. This is real biological dysregulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers intend to share their dataset broadly with BioMapAI, which supports analyses across diverse symptoms and diseases, effectively integrating multi-omics data that are difficult to replicate in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to build a detailed map of how the immune system interacts with gut bacteria and the chemicals they produce,” Oh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By connecting these dots we can start to understand what’s driving the disease and pave the way for genuinely precise medicine that has long been out of reach.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional authors include Elizabeth Aiken, Ryan Caldwell, Lina Kozhaya, and Courtney Gunter (The Jackson Laboratory), and Suzanne D.

      &lt;p&gt;Obstetricians and psychiatrists are concerned about a recent FDA panel spreading misinformation about the potential harms of using SSRIs during pregnancy and postpartum.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Should pregnant women and new mothers take antidepressants? A recent Food and Drug Administration panel raised questions about the safety of these drugs. An estimated 6% to 8% of pregnant women take antidepressants known as SSRIs. Doctors and psychiatrists treating these patients say the FDA panel misrepresented evidence and spread misinformation. NPR's Rhitu Chatterjee is here to tell us more. Rhitu, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RHITU CHATTERJEE, BYLINE: Happy to be here, Ayesha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RASCOE: So I understand you watched the FDA panel. What exactly did the panelists say?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHATTERJEE: So the FDA commissioner, Marty Makary, opened the event, framing the whole discussion around these so-called potential harms of a group of anxiety and depression drugs called SSRIs, which are medicines like Zoloft and Lexapro. And then a majority of panelists, including some psychiatrists, psychologists, a social work professor, cited studies they say illustrate health risks to both mom and baby. One panelist - Roger McFillin, a psychologist from Pennsylvania - suggested that women feel coerced into taking these medicines and that depression is overdiagnosed in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ROGER MCFILLIN: Is that because this underlying mental illness that we're trying to control for - one we don't test for when there is no objective testing - it just is more prevalent in women? Or are women just naturally experiencing their emotions more intensely? And those are gifts. They're not symptoms of a disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHATTERJEE: Now, to be clear, psychiatrists use a specific set of criteria to diagnose depression and anxiety. And a person has to have had five or more of those criteria for a depression diagnosis, and just feeling overly emotional isn't enough to be diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RASCOE: What are doctors and psychiatrists saying about the panel's claims of harms caused by SSRI use in pregnancy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHATTERJEE: So several health care groups and organizations have released statements against those claims and said that they are misleading. Now, responding to that critique, Andrew Nixon, spokesperson for the federal Health Department, told NPR in an email that the claim that the panel was, quote, "one-sided" is, quote, "insulting" to the panelists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I spoke with Dr. Christopher Zahn, chief of clinical practice with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists - or ACOG - one of the groups pushing back on some of the panel's claims. He explained why the studies cited by most panelists were what he described as poor-quality evidence or nonevidence-based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHRISTOPHER ZAHN: So if you're comparing a pregnant patient who has taken an SSRI, the control group should be the pregnant patient with mental health abnormalities who hasn't taken an SSRI. And part of the problem with a number of those studies - they don't use the right control group. And in fact, it's kind of like comparing apples and oranges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHATTERJEE: You know, Dr. Zahn told me that well-controlled studies don't find this association of SSRI use with those health risks that the panelists talked about. Now, the one risk that does show up is for newborns of moms who take the drugs in the third trimester. And the babies can have some withdrawal symptoms, but they resolve on their own in a few days. And according to him and most others in the field, the bottom line is these studies that have followed hundreds of thousands of women find that most SSRIs are safe for pregnant and postpartum women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RASCOE: What about the people who are just trying to decide whether they should take these drugs when they're pregnant or just after giving birth? What are the main things they need to know?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHATTERJEE: So firstly, Ayesha, is that there are risks of not treating their symptoms at this stage of life. The negative consequences on the health of both mom and baby are very well-documented. Here's Dr. Kay Roussos-Ross. She's an OBGYN at the University of Florida, and she was the only person on the FDA panel to spell those harms out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KAY ROUSSOS-ROSS: When mental health conditions go untreated, these women are less likely to attend their prenatal care appointments, and they're more likely to use substances during their pregnancy. They are also more likely to face additional risks such as preeclampsia and cesarean delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHATTERJEE: And mental illness is a leading cause of maternal deaths in this country, including deaths due to suicide. Now, I should add that SSRIs aren't the only option for treating anxiety and depression during and after pregnancy. For those with mild to moderate depression and anxiety, you know, talk therapy is the first and best option. There's also peer support. But for those with moderate to severe depression and those who are having trouble accessing talk therapy, which is a big issue, then antidepressants are an option. Now, it won't be right for everyone, but talk about all of this with your doctor. Weigh it all against the risk of not treating your symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RASCOE: That's NPR's Rhitu Chatterjee.
