"I asked him, 'What about the dash?' His real story lies in the dash between those two dates."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott Hancock never believed he made much of a difference in his life. However, now that he's gone, his wife has made it her mission to let people know that he did make a difference. A huge one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He grew up in Pocatello in the 1950s. At age 4, he went to bed one night a perfectly healthy, happy little boy. The next morning, he woke up unable to walk. His parents rushed him to St. Anthony Hospital, where doctors, fresh from training at a polio clinic back east, recognized the signs immediately. The polio virus had attacked the nerves in his legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was sent to the Elks Rehabilitation Center for Polio in Boise, where he was fitted with leg braces to help support his weight and returned home. Despite this drastic and unexpected life change, his parents refused to treat him differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was the youngest of five children," Colleen Hancock said. "He was expected to do his chores just like his brothers and sister, behave appropriately, and not complain. He believed that made him the man he became — a regular person who just happened to have a disability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He learned to live resourcefully at a young age. As a little boy, he sold worms, dug for Island Park fishermen, shined his brother's shoes for a nickel, and fixed roller skates for neighborhood kids — all to buy small gifts for his mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back then, Pocatello schools weren't sure how to accommodate students with disabilities, and some people feared they might catch polio by touching someone who had survived it. His mother fought for her son's right to an education. She eventually helped establish the Handicapped School at Idaho State University for Scott and many other students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He returned to public school in seventh grade, using his crutches and a wheelchair to get around. He went on to graduate from Highland High School's very first graduating class in 1964, later enrolling at Idaho State University as an art major.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Seeing Scott Hancock riding a motorcycle from his wheelchair was a sight that turned heads, but it was something that gave him much pleasure in life. (Photo: Family photo)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was only the beginning of his long list of accomplishments, according to Colleen Hancock. He helped write Idaho's Americans with Disabilities Act legislation and served on multiple state councils for people with disabilities. He directed a senior program in northern Idaho, traveling the state to set up meal services and secure financial help for seniors in need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, he shifted gears into construction. For 34 years, he built and remodeled homes across northern Idaho doing much of the work crawling on the ground or from his wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He found a different way of solving problems. He kept a marble in his pocket while he was building houses. He put the marble on the floor to see if it rolled to determine if the floors were straight," said Colleen. "He never let being in a wheelchair stop him from doing the things he wanted to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He made friends with kids who had fast cars, hitching rides until he could afford his own vehicle. When he finally bought one, he retrofitted it with hand controls and drove it hunting and fishing in Island Park and throughout southeast Idaho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of his greatest joys was riding his Honda Gold Wing motorcycle retrofitted so he could drive it from his wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also wrote extensively, contributing to the Island Park News, Blackfoot Morning News and publishing in Idaho Magazine, American Motorcyclist and Sports Afield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet he often dismissed his work as insignificant. "There are so many others who do a much better job," he would say. "These are just silly little stories anyone could write."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Author and Island Park News columnist Scott Hancock at a book signing in Island Park with his friend and fellow author EC Stilson of Pocatello. (Photo: Family photo)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was asked many times to write a book about his life, but always said, "Nobody would believe I really did those things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Hancocks eventually returned to southeast Idaho, settling in Blackfoot, he reluctantly "retired." That's when he began writing the "little stories" about his life that grew into two volumes of "Tales from the High Lonesome." They were so well received that he began writing a third volume before his death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colleen Hancock has since published Volume 3, now available on Amazon, fulfilling the promise she made to her husband to publish it. She plans to combine his remaining writings into a fourth book, creating one final large collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott's books are available through Amazon, Barnes &amp;amp; Noble and at Kesler's Market in Blackfoot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she emphasizes that writing was just a small part of his accomplishments and who he was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He raised children who were not his own and loved them as if they were. He gave from his heart, made friends everywhere, and loved being with people," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Colleen Hancock, sharing his legacy is about honoring the impact he never fully saw in himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am not the writer. My husband was. His story is one of resilience. I can only try to express what I saw and learned from him and share some of his dash with you," she concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

In severe cases, Salmonella Dublin can kill people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Making matters worse, the new study revealed that cattle strains have the highest levels of antibiotic resistance, particularly to drugs meant for treating infections, such as tetracycline and cephalosporins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The increasing antibiotic resistance means that infections may become harder to treat, potentially leading to longer illnesses or more severe symptoms for people and animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If treatments become less effective, human infections could become more dangerous, especially for vulnerable groups like the elderly, children, or those with weak immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Study authors added that the US, being a major beef and dairy-producing country, is at an even greater risk of this superbug turning into a widespread health emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cattle are the main carriers of a superbug called Salmonella Dublin, an antibiotic-resistant bacterium (Stock Image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Penn State researchers (pictured) found that the bacteria was present in cows, people, and in both food and farm surfaces&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers used data from two public sources: the National Center for Biotechnology Information Pathogen Isolate Browser and the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These provided whole-genome sequences of Salmonella Dublin, which allowed the team to examine each strain's genes in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They compared 581 samples from cattle, 664 from humans, and 905 from the environment (food and farm areas) to identify patterns in how the bacteria's genes cause severe disease and resist antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacteria from cows, people, and the environment were incredibly similar, with 72 percent of the 2,150 strains differing by only a few DNA changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although cow strains had the most genes that were resistant to medication, those found contaminating food and surfaces had more DNA mutations linked to quinolone resistance, a drug used to treat humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the study published in &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.00689-25"&gt;Applied and Environmental Microbiology&lt;/a&gt; warned that each strain examined had similar genes that make them dangerous, like those helping them stick to cells or invade the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These genes were present in almost every strain in cows, people, or food, meaning the bacteria are consistently harmful no matter where it's found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Study leader Erika Ganda, an associate professor of food animal microbiomes, said in a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/bacteria-strains-infecting-cattle-and-humans-us-are-highly-similar"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;: 'That's important, because it shows that Salmonella Dublin is highly connected across humans, animals and the environment — so efforts to control it need to consider all three.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Contaminated beef can make people sick with Salmonella Dublin, leading to blood infections (Stock Image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Direct contact on farms can also transmit the bacteria from cattle to people (Stock Image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/9/17-0136_article"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;) has estimated that Salmonella bacteria, including Dublin, cause about 1.2 million illnesses every year in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Salmonella Dublin infections have been particularly severe due to their tendency to cause bloodstream infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 2005 and 2013, a staggering 78 percent of Salmonella Dublin infections required hospitalization, and 4.2 percent resulted in death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) treats Salmonella outbreaks, including those involving Dublin, as high-risk health emergencies, often issuing urgent recalls to prevent their spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One incident in 2019 saw 34,222 pounds of contaminated ground beef from Central Valley Meat Company in California recalled to prevent a large-scale outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, 13 people were infected with Salmonella Dublin in the state, and one died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now that the bacterium has become resistant to antibiotics, the threat to humans is greater than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC has said that antibiotic-resistant infections, including those from Salmonella, cause over 2.8 million illnesses and more than 35,000 deaths each year in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers emphasized the need for a 'One Health' approach, combining efforts in human, animal, and environmental health to control the superbug's spread and reduce antibiotic use in livestock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Hormone therapy promises relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many women wonder about taking it. That’s because the treatment, subject of a recent expert panel convened by the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/fda-kennedy-antidepressants-hormones-meetings-experts-afbd525b29ca5e2585b79548a075be75"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, has long been shrouded in uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was once used routinely. But in 2002, research testing one type was stopped early because of concerns about increased risks of breast cancer and blood clots. Concerns lingered even though later studies showed the benefits of today’s hormone therapies outweigh the risks for many women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is still a lot of confusion and a lot of fear,” said Grayson Leverenz, a 50-year-old from Durham, North Carolina, who hesitated to take it but is glad she did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others increasingly are also giving hormone therapy a second look. But experts continue to disagree about how to present the treatment’s pros and cons. The FDA-assembled panel stressed the benefits and suggested health warnings be removed from at least some versions — prompting dozens of experts to call for more input before making any changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors say hormone therapy is a great option for many, but not all, menopausal women — and it’s important to understand the nuanced reality of these treatments before deciding what’s best.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;h2&gt;How hormone therapy works &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It treats symptoms that can arise when menstruation winds down and ends, causing levels of estrogen and progesterone to drop very low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One type is low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy. Because it’s applied into the vagina, very little circulates in the blood and the risks are far lower. Doctors say it’s a good option for women whose biggest complaint is vaginal dryness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole-body therapy includes pills, patches, sprays, gels or a vaginal ring that deliver doses of hormones into the bloodstream at levels high enough to have significant effects on symptoms like hot flashes. Such systemic hormones include estrogens and progestogens.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zwink, a nurse in Castle Rock, Colorado, began using an estrogen patch more than a year ago and also has an IUD, which gives her progesterone. The treatment has relieved her hot flashes, improved her sleep and eased her joint pain and bloating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not like a 100% magic wand,” she said. “But it definitely has made a significant difference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Menopause Society says hormone therapy can lower the risk of cardiovascular disease if started within 10 years of reaching menopause. It may also reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes and maintain bone density for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They might have a drop in their bone density at age 60" instead of at age 50, said Dr. MargEva Morris Cole, an OB-GYN with Duke University.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Hormone therapy carries some risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Leverenz was first prescribed hormone therapy last year, she kept worrying about the risks she’d heard about — then finally decided: “I can’t live like this anymore.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a combination of three medications, her anxiety lifted, her sleep improved, her joint pain and hot flashes went away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just feel like myself again,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors say many patients hesitate to try hormones, and they try to reassure them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women can use estrogen therapy for seven years – and estrogen-progestogen therapy for three to five years – before breast cancer risk goes up, according to the Menopause Society. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group says both estrogen therapy and estrogen-progestogen therapy increase the risk of stroke, which goes away soon after stopping hormones. The risk of blood clots rises if you take hormones by mouth, but may be lower if you use a patch, gel or spray. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of these risks are small,” said Dr. Nanette Santoro, an OB-GYN at the University of Colorado. “And they have to be weighed against the benefit of symptom relief.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age, medical history and how long women stay on the hormones are also considerations. Many women take them for around five years, and those who’ve had a stroke or certain other conditions may be advised against using them at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Debate on changing warnings on hormone medications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors are divided over whether there should be changes in “black box” health warnings on some hormone treatments. All estrogen drugs still carry boxed warnings about the higher rates of stroke, blood clots and cognitive problems among women taking the medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the physicians at the recent expert panel meeting convened by the FDA prescribe the hormones or are involved with a pharmaceutical industry campaign opposing the warning label. A letter signed by 76 doctors and researchers argues that “removing label warnings without adequate scientific assessment puts patients at risk,” and asked the agency to hold an advisory committee meeting with a public hearing before making any changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, doctors urge people to be wary of misinformation, like false claims on social media posts that hormones will prevent dementia and ensure a healthy old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can’t say that you are going to live a longer, healthier life because you took hormones,” Duke’s Cole said. “I don’t want the pendulum to go so far that people feel that it is promising health for the next 30 to 40 years.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Alternatives to hormone therapy for menopause &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santoro pointed to a new non-hormonal medication called fezolinetant, marketed as Veozah, for hot flashes and night sweats. The anti-epileptic medication gabapentin, in low doses, can also be used for hot flashes and a moisturizer can improve vaginal dryness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts also say regular exercise and a healthy diet can help manage symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santoro urged against the “wild proliferation” of supplements claiming to be menopause cure-alls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everybody is in on the menopause gold rush,” she said. “If it looks too good to be true, it probably is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    &lt;p&gt;Restaurateur Tommy Fello was driving from his Ohio establishment to his house on Christmas Eve when he started veering off the road. Fello, then 71, had been awake since 4 a.m. local time preparing a holiday buffet for his family. He chalked the disturbance up to a flat tire. Driving slowly and relying on the vehicle's autocorrect feature, he was able to complete his journey home safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Fello stepped out of the truck, he couldn't get his balance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I finally realized it wasn't the truck that was veering. It was me that was veering," Fello said. He went indoors and talked to his wife and daughter, who said he looked unwell. About five minutes later, they called 911. Paramedics took him to an area hospital, where he lost all movement in his left arm and leg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They were literally just like appendages on me. I could not feel them and could not do anything," Fello said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A clot-busting drug reversed the stroke, but the numbness on the left side of his body, including his face, remained. He struggled to swallow, eat or drink. Physical and occupational therapy produced only minor improvements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sharon Covey, Fello's occupational therapist and the founder of the Center for Stroke and Hand Recovery, Inc., told CBS News that his arm was essentially stuck in a bent position with his fingers curled when he met her in January 2024. The position and tension in the limb caused Fello constant pain. Working in his restaurant was out of the question.  &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It was very scary. You take for granted so many of the things you do, and even the common, simplest things become like a chore," Fello said. "We mark all these small victories ... Being able to lift up your arm or pick up a cup is a gigantic accomplishment. Those little accomplishments are gigantic to a stroke victim. They encouraged me to keep going on. But there was always a thought in the back of my mind: 'Is this as good as it's going to get?'" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A "first-of-its-kind technology"  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, another recovering stroke patient suggested Fello look into an implant called the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/stroke-treatment-vivistim/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Vivistim System&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf21/P210007B.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;FDA-approved&lt;/a&gt; implant, developed by the medical device company MicroTransponder Inc., uses vagus nerve stimulation during rehabilitation to improve hand and arm function for stroke victims. The vagus nerves are the body's longest cranial nerve, with one on each side of the body, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22279-vagus-nerve" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. They regulate the body's involuntary functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vivistim Therapy system involves a physical or occupational therapist sending wireless signals to the device. That signal delivers a brief, gentle pulse to the vagus nerve while the stroke patient performs rehabilitative tasks. The stroke patient also does at-home exercises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Erez Nossek, a neurosurgeon and director of the cranial bypass program at NYU Langone, told CBS News that the vagus nerve stimulation can enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself, known as neuroplasticity. That increased neuroplasticity can result in "greater and faster improvements in motor function for stroke survivors," Nossek said in emailed remarks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There is no other FDA-approved technology proven to boost neuroplasticity for stroke survivors, creating new connections in the brain, which is theirs to keep, even after the device is no longer in use," Nossek said. "This is (a) first-of-its-kind technology that is redefining what is possible for this patient population." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 108-person trial &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00475-X/abstract" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;published in The Lancet in 2021&lt;/a&gt; found that the device generated two to three times greater improvement in hand and arm function for stroke survivors when compared with just rehab. Stroke patients who have limited hand and arm function six months or more after their stroke and are considered to have "moderate to severe deficits" qualify for the device, the company &lt;a href="https://microtransponder.showpad.com/share/D0VkrCHvDXiqoQf11CiVP" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;said in a fact sheet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Implant aids in recovery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fello turned to the Cleveland Clinic, where he met cerebrovascular neurosurgeon Dr. Mark Bain. He studies stroke recovery, especially in the cases of patients like Fello, whose rehab progress has plateaued months after the stroke. Bain determined that Fello was a candidate for the Vivistim System. Fello became the first Cleveland Clinic patient to receive the implant on April 29, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It didn't really scare me to try and do it. I was anxious to see how it worked," Fello said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device was placed during an hour-long procedure. The vagus nerve sits just below the carotid artery, so Bain and his surgical team made a small incision to place the leads of the implant and hid the scar in a fold of Fello's neck. The key-fob sized implant was placed under Fello's clavicle. Bain said the procedure itself is low-risk, with "less than 1% chance of any complications." Two weeks after the surgery, the device was turned on and Fello returned to his rehabilitative work with Covey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Covey said Fello has made huge progress since the device was implanted four months ago. She said he has no pain or tension in the limb, and is beginning to practice using his left arm to carry items. The task is difficult, she said, but isn't "something he could have done before." Fello, now 72, said he's been thrilled by the progress he's made in a short time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm very, very happy to do it, very proud to do it, and I'm glad I did it," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"The sky's the limit"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 800,000 people in the United States experience an ischemic stroke each year, Bain said. Vivistim and &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/video/robotic-coach-offer-new-hope-for-stroke-patients-on-the-road-to-recovery/?intcid=CNM-00-10abd1h" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;other new technologies&lt;/a&gt; may offer hope to the patients like Fello who struggle to recover with just rehabilitation, Bain said. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think over the next probably five to 10 years, what you're going to see is an explosion of procedures, devices and things in rehab that will help people, once they've had strokes, to get their lives back," Bain said. "In the future, I think the sky's the limit for what we can expect for stroke recovery." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of his conversation with CBS News, Bain had given seven other stroke patients a Vivistim implant. Covey said at her practice, there are eight patients with the implant receiving the paired therapy course. MicroTransponder Inc. declined to say how many patients have received the implant, but &lt;a href="https://www.vivistim.com/find-a-provider/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;shared a map&lt;/a&gt; that shows dozens of surgeons and rehabilitation therapists that provide the therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this is the newest, most effective strategy for people getting their affected limbs back," Covey said. "This is the first real technique that has been available, at least in the last 20 years, for stroke rehab. The theories that we use as practitioners to increase somebody's use of their affected arm are 50 to 75 years old. So this is a new technology that's really going to turn the stroke recovery world upside down." &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;You might expect that with age comes a natural progression of brain degeneration, but new research shows that this might not be the case for all regions of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new analysis of mouse and human brains suggests that some parts of the somatosensory cortex – the part of the brain that processes sensory information – aren't just exempt from the thinning found in other parts, they actually grow stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This result suggests that the brain's ability to adapt and change continues, even into older age – and that the more you use it, the stronger your brain could be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-finds-humans-age-faster-at-2-sharp-peaks-heres-when"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Study Finds Humans Age Faster at 2 Sharp Peaks – Here's When&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Until now, it had not been considered that the primary somatosensory cortex consists of a stack of several extremely thin layers of tissue, each with its own architecture and function. We have now found that these layers age differently," &lt;a href="https://www.dzne.de/en/news/press-releases/press/the-cerebral-cortex-ages-less-than-thought"&gt;explains neuroscientist Esther Kühn&lt;/a&gt; of the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases and the Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although the cerebral cortex becomes thinner overall, some of its layers remain stable or, surprisingly, are even thicker with age. Presumably because they are particularly solicited and thus retain their functionality. We therefore see evidence for neuroplasticity, that is, adaptability, even in senior people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171357" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171357" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/study-schematic.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-171357" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/study-schematic.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/study-schematic-600x333.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171357" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;An overview of the human portion of the study. (Liu et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Neurosci.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to adapt to changing circumstances and requirements, reorganizing and rewiring its neural connections to support evolving needs. The assumption is that neuroplasticity peaks when you're young, and gradually declines with age; however, this assumption is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.101514"&gt;not necessarily supported&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brs.2020.09.004"&gt;robust evidence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by neuroscientists Peng Liu and Juliane Doehler of &lt;span&gt;Otto von Guericke University &lt;/span&gt;Magdeburg in Germany, a team of researchers undertook a study of possible age-related changes in the human cerebral cortex, a folded region of the brain that usually thins with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is generally assumed that less brain volume means reduced function," &lt;a href="https://www.dzne.de/en/news/press-releases/press/the-cerebral-cortex-ages-less-than-thought"&gt;Kühn says&lt;/a&gt;. "However, little is known about how exactly the cortex actually ages. This is remarkable, given that many of our daily activities depend on a functioning cortex. That's why we examined the situation with high-resolution brain scans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers took particularly sensitive  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="171348" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; brain scans of 61 adults between the ages of 21 and 80, focusing on a small region at the top of the brain called the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_somatosensory_cortex"&gt;primary somatosensory cortex&lt;/a&gt;, which receives tactile sensory information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that this region is structured a little bit like a stack of crepes: multiple layers of extremely thin, delicate tissue, each with its own role. These layers, the brain scans revealed, present differently depending on a person's age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some are thinner in older people, as expected; but the middle and upper layers were found to be thicker in older people than the same layers seen in younger people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The middle layer is effectively the gateway for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_perception"&gt;haptic&lt;/a&gt; [touch] stimuli. In the layers above, further processing occurs," &lt;a href="https://www.dzne.de/en/news/press-releases/press/the-cerebral-cortex-ages-less-than-thought"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Kühn. "For example, in the case of sensory stimuli from the hand, the upper layers are particularly involved in the interaction between neighboring fingers. This is important when grasping objects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lower layers, by contrast, were thinner in the older patients. These are the layers that handle modulation, where tactile signals are amplified or suppressed, depending on context. For example, you don't tend to feel your clothing unless you're thinking about it – similar to the way &lt;a href="https://www.ceenta.com/news-blog/why-cant-i-see-my-nose"&gt;your brain edits out your nose&lt;/a&gt; from your field of vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As to why different layers thicken or thin with age, the team suggests it could come down to the old adage of "use it or lose it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The middle and upper layers of the cortex are most directly exposed to external stimuli. They are permanently active because we have constant contact with our environment," &lt;a href="https://www.dzne.de/en/news/press-releases/press/the-cerebral-cortex-ages-less-than-thought"&gt;Kühn says&lt;/a&gt;. "The neural circuits in the lower layers are stimulated to a lesser extent, especially in later life. I therefore see our findings as an indication that the brain preserves what is used intensively. That's a feature of neuroplasticity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, although the lower layers shrink, they may compensate for any cellular degeneration. Their myelin content was found to increase in response to an increase in a certain type of neuron that amplifies the modulation signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is another sign of adaptability, and the researchers hope that, in future research, they may be able to find a way to promote these adaptive mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Together, our findings are consistent with the general idea that we can do something good for our brains with appropriate stimulation. I think it's an optimistic notion that we can influence our aging process to a certain degree," &lt;a href="https://www.dzne.de/en/news/press-releases/press/the-cerebral-cortex-ages-less-than-thought"&gt;Kühn says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-02013-1"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I have told her that if she is not comfortable attending, that’s fine, but she doesn’t get to decide for me. Her response has been to tell me to go ahead, but “don’t be surprised when the baby is stillborn.” I’ve had enough. She is really starting to cast a pall over what should be a happy occasion. My husband tells me she’s always been superstitious and to just ignore her. Easy for him to say—he’s not the one who’s pregnant! How can I convince him that he needs to get his mother to keep her opinions to herself?&lt;/p&gt;

Or, at any rate, I wouldn’t bother, because even if you convinced &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;, he’d still have to convince her.

You’ve already told her where you stand; she’s blown right by that &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; escalated things. Someone who tells you your baby is going to be stillborn is not someone you need to hear from. So stop speaking to her altogether until after the baby is born. I wouldn’t even make a production of it: I’d just say, “Oh, sorry, can’t talk now” whenever she calls—or not pick up the phone when you see it’s her. If she stops in for a visit, you’ll be just on your way out.&lt;/p&gt;

If she complains about your freeze-out to her son—and she will—that’s his chance to say something to her, which is what you wanted in the first place. If nothing else, he can explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you’re icing her out. That conversation will be good for both of them. Will it change her? Doubtful. But the most important outcome of this is that you won’t have to listen to the dreadful things she has to say anymore. And you can keep this strategy in your back pocket for after the baby is born, if she tries to get under your skin then too. You are under no obligation to put up with her (or anyone’s) bad behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

My friend and her husband stepped up and took care of the baby most days for 18 months, until the birth mother came to them and announced that she just couldn’t do it anymore. They ended up adopting the baby. A couple years later, the birth mom came to them with the fact that she was pregnant again. Stacy and her husband adopted this baby at birth. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/03/adoption-disclosure-teenagers-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;They raised both girls for the next two years before divorcing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Potassium absorption isn't significantly affected by when you eat a banana.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The body naturally balances potassium levels based on intake and current needs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A varied, nutrient-rich diet is more important than banana timing for potassium benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bananas are a go-to snack for good reason: they’re convenient, tasty and packed with nutrients. There’s no denying that bananas are an excellent source of potassium. A medium-sized banana is loaded with around 420 mg of potassium, which is about 12 to 16 percent of your daily needs (2,600 mg for females and 3,400 mg for males).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potassium is a mineral and electrolyte that plays some very important roles in supporting overall health. It helps keep your body hydrated, supports cell and nerve functioning and maintains healthy muscle and heart function, yet most Americans don’t get enough of it each day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But if you’re aiming to get the biggest potassium benefit from your banana, does the &lt;em&gt;timing&lt;/em&gt; of when you eat it actually matter? We asked registered dietitians to weigh in—and the answer might surprise you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-optimal-timing-for-banana-intake"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Optimal Timing for Banana Intake &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Truth be told, there is no single “best time” or “worst time” to eat a banana for maximum potassium intake. This is because timing doesn’t have much of an impact on potassium absorption, as opposed to other nutrients. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Our body absorbs potassium passively, like a sponge,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/diane-han-mph-rdn-ld-3351911a5/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Diane Han, M.P.H., RD&lt;/a&gt;. “Once it has absorbed enough or reached an optimal level, absorption becomes limited.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In other words, your body’s pretty good at figuring out what it needs, regardless of when you eat potassium-rich foods. When you eat a banana, your body will figure out what to do that’s best in the moment to maintain a nutritional equilibrium so you don’t experience any negative symptoms, like low blood pressure, dizziness or muscle aches,” says &lt;a href="https://tracynutrition.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Tracy Lockwood Beckerman, M.S., RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-influences-potassium-absorption"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Influences Potassium Absorption? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potassium is absorbed in the small intestine, and your body generally does a good job of using what you consume. But certain factors can affect potassium levels—like high sodium intake, some medications, vomiting or diarrhea and underlying health conditions that impact how your body retains or excretes potassium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Think of potassium levels like a see-saw, Beckerman says. “If you are eating foods that are putting too much potassium into your body, excretion will be high, so levels remain stable,” she says. “If intake is too low, excretion will be low, so it is conserved in the body.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The kidneys do much of this balancing act. If your potassium stores are low, your body will hold on to the necessary amount of potassium when you eat potassium-rich foods. But if your potassium levels are appropriate, your body will excrete the excess through the urine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The other nutrients you eat with bananas don't have much of an impact on potassium absorption. “Potassium acts alone as an electrolyte that does its own thing, regardless if it’s ingested with other macronutrients like proteins, fat and carbohydrates,” Beckerman says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-get-the-most-potassium-from-your-bananas"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How to Get the Most Potassium from Your Bananas &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead of stressing over banana timing, focus on building a nutrient-rich eating pattern. “Eating a variety of whole plant foods supports a balanced diet that promotes heart and overall health, while also helping regulate healthy potassium levels in conjunction with other nutrients,” Han says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, bananas aren’t the only potassium heroes. Other potassium-rich foods to include are potatoes, Swiss chard and spinach.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another tip: keep your sodium in check. Potassium and sodium work together in the body, so maintaining a healthy sodium level can help your body maintain the right balance between sodium and potassium in the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re aiming to get the best potassium benefit from eating bananas, the time you choose to eat one does not really matter. Potassium absorption tends to be efficient regardless of timing. Bananas can help support your body’s potassium needs, whether you eat them morning, evening, or mid-day. Rather than stressing over the perfect time to eat a banana for maximum potassium benefits, focus on getting enough potassium-rich foods in your diet.&lt;br&gt;

Soon, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists confirmed the cause of the mysterious illness: a previously unknown bacteria that was accordingly named &lt;em&gt;Legionella&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Legionella&lt;/em&gt;, unfortunately, is everywhere—in streams, lakes, and water pipes across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;But usually, it occurs in such low concentrations and is so remote that it doesn’t pose a threat to humans. &lt;em&gt;Usually.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Now, city health officials have found the bacteria in the large cooling tanks that serve massive apartment buildings across New York City, particularly in Harlem. Cooling tanks are ideal places for Legionnaire’s to grow and spread. They’re filled with stagnant, warm water that is more hospitable to bacterial growth. Like an evaporative cooler, the systems convert warm stagnant water into cool air for apartment dwellers. They can spray mists laden with the bacteria into the open air, dispersing it across the surrounding air, where it can enter a person’s lungs when they inhale.

Yet, step back, and the irony is hard to miss: this is the one vitamin our bodies are perfectly capable of making, provided we get enough sunlight. But modern life doesn’t always allow for it. Between long hours indoors, sunscreen use, pollution, and lifestyle shifts, vitamin D deficiency has become one of the most widespread nutritional gaps of our time. While sunlight remains the gold standard, food can play a critical supporting role. For vegetarians, who don’t have access to fish or other animal-heavy sources, the options are fewer but not absent.

              &lt;p&gt;What if you could fix your damaged eye without having to shoot a laser at it? Scientists have potentially discovered a novel method of repairing the cornea, similar to LASIK, that wouldn’t require a laser or other invasive surgical tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at Occidental College and the University of California, Irvine, created the technique, which aims to temporarily make the cornea malleable. In experiments with rabbit eyeballs, their method appeared to work while also leaving corneal cells alive. More research is needed to vet the procedure, but if all goes well, it could become a preferred alternative to LASIK, the researchers claim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s a long road between what we’ve done and the clinic. But, if we get there, this technique is widely applicable, vastly cheaper and potentially even reversible,” said lead researcher Michael Hill, a professor of chemistry at Occidental College, in a &lt;a href="https://www.acs.org/pressroom/presspacs/2025/august/an-alternative-to-lasik-without-the-lasers.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the American Chemical Society.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Why some people avoid LASIK&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lasik-eye-surgery/about/pac-20384774"&gt;LASIK&lt;/a&gt; is routinely used to treat conditions like myopia, farsightedness, or astigmatism. It reshapes the cornea—the transparent, outer layer of the eye that captures and focuses light onto the retina—using a precise cutting laser.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though generally safe and effective, the surgery does permanently weaken the structural integrity of the cornea. People will also commonly experience side effects like dry eye and visual disturbances like halos; a small few will even &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8319231/"&gt;develop&lt;/a&gt; serious, if rare, complications like chronic nerve pain. Ideally, the team’s method would avoid these risks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A potentially safer method&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The technique is called electromechanical reshaping. Some of the authors had previously used it to manipulate other parts of the body that contain collagen and water, such as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5008912/"&gt;ears&lt;/a&gt;. It works by altering the pH of the tissue via short bursts of electricity, briefly allowing it to be molded as desired. Once the proper pH is restored, the tissue returns to its original rigid state.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers used the technique on rabbit eyeballs in the lab, some of which were intended to represent myopia in humans. Special contact lenses made from platinum were placed over the extracted eyes. These lenses served as an electrode, providing a base for how the cornea should be correctly reshaped.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once the researchers lightly zapped the eye, the cornea became flexible and contoured to the shape of the lens. Not only did the cornea fill out as the researchers wanted, but the procedure didn’t seem to kill any corneal cells or otherwise affect the cornea’s stability. A YouTube video describing the team’s approach, from the American Chemical Society, can be &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUbJWbUt0m0"&gt;seen&lt;/a&gt; below.&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers admit that it will take more research in animals before they can even think about testing their method in humans. Their next planned step is to try out the procedure on living rabbits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the potential for the team’s work is certainly there, and it may extend beyond treating myopia. The researchers are also hoping to explore whether electromechanical reshaping can help repair farsightedness, astigmatism, and possibly even some forms of cloudy vision.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as has been the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/odds-winning-nih-grants-plummet-new-funding-policy-and-spending-delays-bite"&gt;case for many scientists&lt;/a&gt; during the second Trump administration, the researchers say their work has been delayed over concerns in securing additional funding.&lt;/p&gt;

The headaches usually appear within 24 hours without caffeine, and typically go away within one week or when caffeine is consumed again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why withdrawal headaches are so painful remains somewhat unclear. Because caffeine affects many parts of the body, experts haven't been able to pin down a single overarching cause. But the pain likely comes, in part, from dilated &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/veins-and-arteries" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/veins-and-arteries"&gt;&lt;u&gt;blood vessels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="f2e9421c-28e6-4477-9f0f-ea482efeb276"&gt;Caffeine constricts blood vessels — which is part of the reason why the drug can also, paradoxically, be used to relieve some types of headaches, according to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/does-caffeine-treat-or-trigger-headaches" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/does-caffeine-treat-or-trigger-headaches" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When caffeine use stops, those blood vessels swell, causing more blood flow and, therefore, pain. But &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://physiciandirectory.brighamandwomens.org/details/13897/brian-mcgeeney-neurology-boston-jamaica_plain" target="_blank" data-url="https://physiciandirectory.brighamandwomens.org/details/13897/brian-mcgeeney-neurology-boston-jamaica_plain" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Brian McGeeney&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist and headache specialist at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital, said that's just one contributing cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's involved, but it's not the whole story," he told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/food-diet/does-caffeine-help-or-cause-headaches" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/food-diet/does-caffeine-help-or-cause-headaches"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does caffeine help or cause headaches?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another explanation for caffeine withdrawal headaches has to do with adenosine receptors. The drug blocks adenosine, a building block of RNA, from attaching to receptors scattered across the central nervous system. This causes neurons to fire more quickly and blood vessels to constrict, which, in turn, makes people feel more alert and awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When someone stops consuming caffeine, the sudden buildup of adenosine in the body can &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/7/3/30" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/7/3/30" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;contribute to withdrawal headaches&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This is also why caffeine is commonly used to treat headaches: By blocking adenosine receptors, it prevents blood vessel dilation from the outset. In fact, caffeine can make painkillers like &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/42205-ibuprofen.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/42205-ibuprofen.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ibuprofen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/42785-acetaminophen.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/42785-acetaminophen.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;acetaminophen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; work more efficiently, according to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/does-caffeine-treat-or-trigger-headaches#:~:text=Also%2C%20when%20caffeine%20is%20taken,medication%20to%20provide%20faster%20relief." target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/does-caffeine-treat-or-trigger-headaches#:~:text=Also%2C%20when%20caffeine%20is%20taken,medication%20to%20provide%20faster%20relief." referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, as Pearson noted, much of caffeine withdrawal is yet to be explained. "We certainly don't know, but these are all reasons why it might be causing headaches," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine withdrawal often &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278691521002611" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278691521002611" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;happens in hospital settings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when patients have to quit their coffee habit to undergo a medical procedure. Some studies also show caffeine withdrawal symptoms in people who fast, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278691521002611" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278691521002611" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;such as Muslims observing Ramadan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When life is interrupted unpredictably, like you end up in the emergency room or get admitted to hospital, you see a lot of caffeine withdrawal," McGeeney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="14e124de-9b23-4a64-bee2-5ef125afdd98"&gt;Caffeine is usually &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/9-reasons-why-the-right-amount-of-coffee-is-good-for-you" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/9-reasons-why-the-right-amount-of-coffee-is-good-for-you" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;safe in moderation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But when someone is looking to reduce or eliminate their caffeine intake, experts agree that the best strategy is to cut down gradually. Drink a little less each day, or substitute lower-caffeine alternatives, like tea, to make the transition easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If somebody's using caffeine chronically and they want to cut back, I would do it quite gradually," Pearson said. "So no faster than about 25 to 50 milligrams of caffeine reduced per day — that's a quarter to half a cup of coffee."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a headache lasts longer than a week, Pearson recommended seeking medical care, as that time frame suggests the headache may be triggered by something other than caffeine withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-Gqdx774KcPGQZTxVgY7G3n-9FCA4TIhP6d0IDjtS129ixg77mOhVGIk" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-Gqdx774KcPGQZTxVgY7G3n-9FCA4TIhP6d0IDjtS129ixg77mOhVGIk slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study finds that lithium loss triggers &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;Alzheimer’s&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Alzheimer&amp;amp;#039;s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily affects older adults, leading to memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. It is the most common cause of dementia. The disease is characterized by the buildup of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain, which disrupt cell function and communication. There is currently no cure, and treatments focus on managing symptoms and improving quality of life.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/span&gt;, but a lithium-based compound reverses the disease in mice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What sets off the earliest chain of events that leads to Alzheimer’s disease? And why do some people who show Alzheimer’s-like brain changes never progress to dementia? These unresolved questions have challenged scientists for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Harvard Medical School now believe they may have an explanation: a deficiency of lithium in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their study, published on August 6 in Nature, demonstrates for the first time that lithium is naturally present in the brain, where it protects against neurodegeneration and supports the normal functioning of all major brain cell types. The findings — a decade in the making — draw on mouse experiments as well as analyses of human brain tissue and blood samples from people at different stages of cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_490370" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-490370" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Lithium-Deficiency-vs.-Normal-Lithium-Levels.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-490370" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Lithium-Deficiency-vs.-Normal-Lithium-Levels-777x398.jpg" alt="Lithium Deficiency vs. Normal Lithium Levels" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Lithium-Deficiency-vs.-Normal-Lithium-Levels-777x398.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Lithium-Deficiency-vs.-Normal-Lithium-Levels-400x205.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Lithium-Deficiency-vs.-Normal-Lithium-Levels-768x393.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Lithium-Deficiency-vs.-Normal-Lithium-Levels-150x77.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Lithium-Deficiency-vs.-Normal-Lithium-Levels-450x230.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Lithium-Deficiency-vs.-Normal-Lithium-Levels.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-490370" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Top row: In a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease, lithium deficiency (right) dramatically increased amyloid beta deposits in the brain compared with mice that had normal physiological levels of lithium (left). Bottom row: The same was true for the Alzheimer’s neurofibrillary tangle protein tau. Credit: Yankner Lab&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team discovered that loss of lithium in the human brain is among the earliest alterations linked to Alzheimer’s, while in mice, reduced lithium sped up both brain damage and memory decline. They traced this decline to lithium binding with amyloid plaques and reduced absorption in the brain. In follow-up experiments, they showed that a new lithium compound resistant to amyloid capture restored memory in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, the results bring coherence to decades of patient observations and introduce a new framework for understanding the disease, offering potential paths for early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Filling gaps in Alzheimer’s research&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease, which affects an estimated 400 million people worldwide, is marked by a range of brain abnormalities. These include clumps of the protein amyloid beta, tangles of the protein tau, and the loss of a protective protein called REST. Yet none of these features fully account for the disease. Some individuals with such changes show no cognitive impairment, and drugs designed to target amyloid beta often fail to restore memory and provide only limited slowing of decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also well established that both genetic and environmental influences shape a person’s risk, but researchers have long struggled to explain why people with the same risk factors can experience such different outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study suggests that lithium may represent a missing link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_490369" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-490369" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mass-Spectroscopy-of-Human-Brain-Tissue.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-490369" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mass-Spectroscopy-of-Human-Brain-Tissue.jpg" alt="Mass Spectroscopy of Human Brain Tissue" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mass-Spectroscopy-of-Human-Brain-Tissue.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mass-Spectroscopy-of-Human-Brain-Tissue-400x315.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mass-Spectroscopy-of-Human-Brain-Tissue-768x604.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mass-Spectroscopy-of-Human-Brain-Tissue-150x118.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mass-Spectroscopy-of-Human-Brain-Tissue-450x354.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-490369" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Lithium was the only metal that differed significantly between people with and without mild cognitive impairment, often a precursor to Alzheimer’s disease. Credit: Aron et al, ‘Lithium deficiency and the onset of Alzheimer’s disease’, Nature&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The idea that lithium deficiency could be a cause of Alzheimer’s disease is new and suggests a different therapeutic approach,” said senior author Bruce Yankner, professor of genetics and neurology in the Blavatnik Institute at HMS, who in the 1990s was the first to demonstrate that amyloid beta is toxic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Yankner, the findings open the possibility that lithium could eventually be used to treat the disease as a whole rather than targeting only one aspect, such as amyloid beta or tau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Amyloid beta binds lithium&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key finding from the study is that during the early stages of dementia, amyloid beta begins forming deposits that bind to lithium in both humans and mouse models. This binding reduces lithium’s availability in the brain, lowering its function across all major brain cell types. In mice, the drop in lithium levels triggered changes that mirrored Alzheimer’s disease, including memory impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers identified a group of lithium compounds capable of avoiding capture by amyloid beta. Among them, lithium orotate proved the most effective: in mice, it reversed Alzheimer’s-like pathology, protected brain cells from damage, and restored memory function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these results must still be validated in humans through clinical trials, they suggest that monitoring lithium levels could help detect Alzheimer’s at an early stage. They also highlight the potential of amyloid-resistant lithium compounds as candidates for treatment or prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_490368" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-490368" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Lithium-Deficiency-Thins-Myelin-Sheaths.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-490368" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Lithium-Deficiency-Thins-Myelin-Sheaths-777x364.jpg" alt="Lithium Deficiency Thins Myelin Sheaths" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Lithium-Deficiency-Thins-Myelin-Sheaths-777x364.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Lithium-Deficiency-Thins-Myelin-Sheaths-400x188.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Lithium-Deficiency-Thins-Myelin-Sheaths-768x360.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Lithium-Deficiency-Thins-Myelin-Sheaths-150x70.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Lithium-Deficiency-Thins-Myelin-Sheaths-450x211.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Lithium-Deficiency-Thins-Myelin-Sheaths.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-490368" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Lithium deficiency thinned the myelin that coats neurons (right) compared to normal mice (left). Credit: Yankner Lab&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium-based drugs are already prescribed for conditions such as bipolar disorder and major depression, but those therapies require doses high enough to be toxic, particularly in older adults. In contrast, Yankner’s team showed that lithium orotate works at a concentration about one-thousandth of the clinical dose — enough to replicate natural brain lithium levels. Mice given this compound for nearly their entire lifespan showed no signs of toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have to be careful about extrapolating from mouse models, and you never know until you try it in a controlled human clinical trial,” Yankner said. “But so far the results are very encouraging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Lithium depletion is an early sign of Alzheimer’s&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yankner’s interest in lithium began while studying its relationship to REST, a protein known for its neuroprotective role. Determining whether lithium naturally exists in the human brain, and whether its levels shift during the progression of neurodegeneration, required access to brain tissue — something not possible to obtain from living individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this, the lab partnered with the Rush Memory and Aging Project in Chicago, which maintains a collection of postmortem brain samples donated by thousands of participants spanning the full spectrum of cognitive health and decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This breadth of material was essential. Studying advanced Alzheimer’s is, as Yankner described it, “like looking at a battlefield after a war,” where extensive damage obscures the origins of the disease. In contrast, examining early stages allows researchers to find “important clues before the brain is badly damaged.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the leadership of first author Liviu Aron, senior research associate in the Yankner Lab, the team used advanced mass spectroscopy to measure trace levels of about 30 metals in brain and blood samples from individuals who were cognitively healthy, those with mild cognitive impairment, and those with advanced Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_490367" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-490367" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Comparison-of-Amyloid-and-Tau-in-Treated-Mice.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-490367" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Comparison-of-Amyloid-and-Tau-in-Treated-Mice-777x398.jpg" alt="Comparison of Amyloid and Tau in Treated Mice" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Comparison-of-Amyloid-and-Tau-in-Treated-Mice-777x398.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Comparison-of-Amyloid-and-Tau-in-Treated-Mice-400x205.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Comparison-of-Amyloid-and-Tau-in-Treated-Mice-768x393.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Comparison-of-Amyloid-and-Tau-in-Treated-Mice-150x77.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Comparison-of-Amyloid-and-Tau-in-Treated-Mice-450x230.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Comparison-of-Amyloid-and-Tau-in-Treated-Mice.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-490367" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Treating mice with the amyloid-evading lithium orotate (top row) reduced amyloid beta (left) and tau (right) much more effectively than lithium carbonate (bottom row). Credit: Yankner Lab&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium was the only metal that showed clear differences among groups and declined at the earliest stages of memory loss. Healthy donors had higher lithium levels, while those with mild impairment or full Alzheimer’s exhibited substantially reduced levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team confirmed these results with additional samples from brain banks across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This observation aligned with earlier population studies that linked higher environmental lithium — such as lithium naturally occurring in drinking water — with lower rates of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, however, the new research went further by directly detecting lithium in the brains of individuals who had never received it as a therapy, establishing a normal physiological range and showing that lithium is vital for brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lithium turns out to be like other nutrients we get from the environment, such as iron and vitamin C,” Yankner said. “It’s the first time anyone’s shown that lithium exists at a natural level that’s biologically meaningful without giving it as a drug.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Yankner and colleagues took things a step further. They demonstrated in mice that lithium depletion isn’t merely linked to Alzheimer’s disease — it helps drive it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Loss of lithium causes the range of Alzheimer’s-related changes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that feeding healthy mice a lithium-restricted diet brought their brain lithium levels down to a level similar to that in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. This appeared to accelerate the aging process, giving rise to brain inflammation, loss of synaptic connections between neurons, and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Alzheimer’s mouse models, depleted lithium dramatically accelerated the formation of amyloid-beta plaques and structures that resemble neurofibrillary tangles. Lithium depletion also activated inflammatory cells in the brain called microglia, impairing their ability to degrade amyloid; caused the loss of synapses, axons, and neuron-protecting myelin; and accelerated cognitive decline and memory loss — all hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mouse experiments further revealed that lithium altered the activity of genes known to raise or lower risk of Alzheimer’s, including the most well-known, &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replenishing lithium by giving the mice lithium orotate in their water reversed the disease-related damage and restored memory function, even in older mice with advanced disease. Notably, maintaining stable lithium levels in early life prevented Alzheimer’s onset — a finding that confirmed that lithium fuels the disease process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What impresses me the most about lithium is the widespread effect it has on the various manifestations of Alzheimer’s. I really have not seen anything quite like it all my years of working on this disease,” said Yankner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A promising avenue for Alzheimer’s treatment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few limited clinical trials of lithium for Alzheimer’s disease have shown some efficacy, but the lithium compounds they used — such as the clinical standard, lithium carbonate — can be toxic to aging people at the high doses normally used in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new research explains why: Amyloid beta was sequestering these other lithium compounds before they could work. Yankner and colleagues found lithium orotate by developing a screening platform that searches a library of compounds for those that might bypass amyloid beta. Other researchers can now use the platform to seek additional amyloid-evading lithium compounds that might be even more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the most galvanizing findings for us was that there were profound effects at this exquisitely low dose,” Yankner said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If replicated in further studies, the researchers say lithium screening through routine blood tests may one day may offer a way to identify individuals at risk for Alzheimer’s who would benefit from treatment to prevent or delay disease onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying lithium levels in people who are resistant to Alzheimer’s as they age might help scientists establish a target level that they could help patients maintain to prevent onset of the disease, Yankner said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since lithium has not yet been shown to be safe or effective in protecting against neurodegeneration in humans, Yankner emphasizes that people should not take lithium compounds on their own. But he expressed cautious optimism that lithium orotate or a similar compound will move forward into clinical trials in the near future and could ultimately change the story of Alzheimer’s treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My hope is that lithium will do something more fundamental than anti-amyloid or anti-tau therapies, not just lessening but reversing cognitive decline and improving patients’ lives,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

"My aerobic stuff I like to do outside the gym," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also has a gym membership and uses the weight machines for 45 minutes a few times a week. "There are some people who will be at the gym for two, three hours.

The systematic review looked at self-reported data from more than 30 million people and found that those who exercised an average of 2.5 hours a week had a lower risk of early death, cardiovascular disease, and cancer than their sedentary peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that people who exercised up to 2.5 hours longer than the average gained even more health benefits. But even working out for an hour and 15 minutes — half the recommended time of 2.5 hours — lowered the risk of early death, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, compared with no exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="4ce33b4e-7007-4965-b5ed-8fb74a1593e8" data-toc-id="4ce33b4e-7007-4965-b5ed-8fb74a1593e8"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong doesn't believe in taking stacks of buzzy supplements, but said they can be useful for people with certain deficiencies or health conditions.

            &lt;p&gt;To keep his mind sharp, for an hour or two each day, Hong makes sure he does something that challenges his brain. "Your brain's like a muscle — if you don't use it, you lose it" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, work will be enough stimulation for him, but on the weekends, for example, he might play a game of chess or checkers with his kids, or read. Screentime doesn't count, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental stimulation can't prevent the brain from aging, but evidence suggests it can help build resilience against &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facing-early-onset-alzheimers-how-family-copes-with-genetic-fate-2025-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Alzheimer's disease symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as forgetfulness. This resilience is known as cognitive reserve, and studies have found that people with larger reserves, which are built through cognitive activity, developed Alzheimer's disease later in life and had fewer symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most important thing I tell all my patients is age is really a number," Hong said. "Your body may tell you you're 52 years old, but you can behave or you can feel like a 35-year-old. And it can also be the other way around."&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at UC San Francisco have uncovered a surprising culprit in brain aging: a protein called FTL1.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In aging mice, too much of this protein weakened memory and disrupted neural connections. But when scientists blocked FTL1, the mice’s brains regained youthful function, and their memory tests dramatically improved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Aging Hits the Hippocampus Hard&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aging takes a heavy toll on the hippocampus, the part of the brain that drives learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists at UC San Francisco have now pinpointed a single protein, FTL1, that appears to play a central role in this age-related decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By studying how genes and proteins in the hippocampus change over time in mice, the team found that only one stood out as consistently different between young and old animals: FTL1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Mimicking Old Age in Young Brains&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older mice showed higher levels of FTL1, fewer connections between hippocampal neurons, and weaker memory performance. When researchers artificially boosted FTL1 in young mice, their brains and behavior quickly started to resemble those of much older animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cell culture experiments, neurons engineered to produce large amounts of FTL1 developed abnormally. Instead of growing complex, branching neurites, they formed only simple, single-armed extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Reversing Memory Decline by Lowering FTL1&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When scientists reduced FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice, the results flipped. Their neurons made more connections, and the animals significantly improved on memory tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is truly a reversal of impairments,” said Saul Villeda, PhD, associate director of the UCSF Bakar Aging Research Institute and senior author of the paper, which appears in &lt;em&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/em&gt; on August 19. “It’s much more than merely delaying or preventing symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Metabolism, FTL1, and Hope for Therapies&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In old mice, FTL1 also slowed down metabolism in the cells of the hippocampus. But treating the cells with a compound that stimulates metabolism prevented these effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Villeda is optimistic that the work could lead to therapies that block the effects of FTL1 in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing more opportunities to alleviate the worst consequences of old age,” he said. “It’s a hopeful time to be working on the biology of aging.”&lt;/p&gt;

Some studies have previously suggested anthocyanins can help combat dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now a new study from researchers at the &lt;a href="/topic/university-of-kent"&gt;University of Kent&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Antioxidants&lt;/em&gt;, has said the most effective way to use cherries to boost anthocyanins is not to juice them, but instead to turn them into a powder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using cherries that otherwise would have been discarded, researchers analysed cherry juice, pulp and pomace’s retention of anthocyanin. They found “greater biological activity” in developing the powder, which they suggested may bring more health benefits than extracts or supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-awdjp1-0 gofEvQ"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/22/09/21104644-b7d71ceb-0f20-4f02-b85b-65f387a92617.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/22/09/21104644-b7d71ceb-0f20-4f02-b85b-65f387a92617.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/22/09/21104644-b7d71ceb-0f20-4f02-b85b-65f387a92617.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Scientists took cherries that otherwise would have been thrown out (Place UK/ PA)" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-18800"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Scientists took cherries that otherwise would have been thrown out (Place UK/ PA)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/biosciences/people/2081/ezcurra-marina"&gt;Dr Marina Ezcurra&lt;/a&gt;, the project’s lead researcher based in Kent’s &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/school-of-natural-sciences"&gt;School of Natural Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, said: ‘Working with local growers has been key to this success.

Flavonoids are understood to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties that can boost your chances against dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 08:20:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxONzcyWk5BX0hXS2xrT3RiRDE0aFlDNURSZGRmQVhXT05seHVraC11WTF6TjJ0STJhUWNVZldZQmlzMGFFZDdEbG9KRXVsTjBsM0hjYmY3bU1FUlN2aFdVb0pvVXpRanVpQ24wVHFLQjNlUUVXY3BJYmcxN2NJSlg2d2xCd3pPazllNlZqSnl1OFNXY2ZmckJ5dFFlQjVTQ0RtWjhPR2RJUlFvdlZzd1V1ZA</guid></item><item><title>父亲希望能治愈影响其他300人的儿子罕见病--英国广播公司</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5URHQxcXZxdHlZTG9waWhxeUhxV091Zy1RT2plYWxNQm1xb3BnNm1VWXFOa1hoaXBUTGhta1B6Sm1zLXpYcUZRaXk5cjAyRFV5X0RFVkJ3ZHlCQdIBX0FVX3lxTFBmYXVjQzctN0N3cjVlaXRJWXYyNENJVXhoZ2NLci1MWDVnZW85RjREX3lrc3p1dTA0NlNKTnlHeTcydmdhNlktclBjSWFhZ0c0Sm9EWUtIWUpxZjR6bnNv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Dad's hope to find cure for son's rare condition&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-801dd632-0 eSlECZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-801dd632-12 bwIYVa"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;James McCarthy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 hwLppI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC News, West of England&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;Clara Bullock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 hwLppI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC News, Somerset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250814-092707-b0ec5bc3fc-web-2.27.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/43a7/live/9e3e4040-7fea-11f0-9faa-4582154214b0.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/43a7/live/9e3e4040-7fea-11f0-9faa-4582154214b0.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/43a7/live/9e3e4040-7fea-11f0-9faa-4582154214b0.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/43a7/live/9e3e4040-7fea-11f0-9faa-4582154214b0.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/43a7/live/9e3e4040-7fea-11f0-9faa-4582154214b0.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/43a7/live/9e3e4040-7fea-11f0-9faa-4582154214b0.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/43a7/live/9e3e4040-7fea-11f0-9faa-4582154214b0.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/43a7/live/9e3e4040-7fea-11f0-9faa-4582154214b0.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Supplied by family Tom is holding is son Jenson in his arms, their faces are touching and they are both smiling at the camera." class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Supplied by family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Tom hopes a cure or life-changing therapies can be found for his son Jenson&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A father whose son has been diagnosed with a condition only 300 people have in the world has launched a mission to find a "cure or life-changing therapy". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Within days of Jenson's birth he collapsed and was not expected to live.

In 2017, around &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7310804/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;462 million people&lt;/a&gt;, or 6.28% of the world’s population lived with the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2024, the &lt;hl-trusted-source source="World Health Organization" rationale="Highly respected international organization"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/13-11-2024-urgent-action-needed-as-global-diabetes-cases-increase-four-fold-over-past-decades" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;World Health Organization (WHO)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; reported that the number of people living with diabetes worldwide had risen to more than 800 million, of whom 95% had type 2 diabetes. And the condition can lead to complications such as cardiovascular disease, vision problems and kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity and overweight are common in people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, and losing weight can help manage symptoms, or even &lt;a href="https://bmjgroup.com/losing-weight-can-reverse-type-2-diabetes-but-is-rarely-achieved-or-recorded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;reverse the condition&lt;/a&gt; in some. Now, a study suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318405#faq" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;turmeric or curcumin&lt;/a&gt; supplements might help people with these conditions on their weight-loss journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review of 20 randomized controlled trials, published in &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Nature" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41387-025-00386-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Nutrition &amp;amp; Diabetes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, found that turmeric or curcumin — the active component of turmeric — had a beneficial effect on some indicators of obesity, and might therefore help with weight management in people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/thomas-m-holland-md-ms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Thomas M.

From a scientific standpoint, these changes, about 2 kg (5 lbs) of weight loss and [approximately] 2–3 cm (about an inch) off the waist, may seem small, but in population health even minor improvements in central obesity can reduce metabolic and cardiovascular risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turmeric has long been used to add flavor and color to foods, and can also be taken as a supplement. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9881416/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest that it may have antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects, and that it is generally &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318405#adverse-effects" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;safe and well tolerated&lt;/a&gt; at the dosages found in food, although may have some side effects at higher dosages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This latest review investigated the effects of turmeric/curcumin supplementation on measures of body size, including body weight, &lt;hl-trusted-source source="National Heart Lung and Blood Institute " rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/calculate-your-bmi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;body mass index (BMI)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, percentage of fat mass, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and hip circumference, in 20 different studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;All were randomized controlled trials comparing supplementation with placebo, carried out in adults with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in the studies were given dosages ranging from 80 milligrams per day (mg/day) to 2,100 mg/day, for 8– 36 weeks. The researchers noted that adverse events, such as stomachache, itching, vertigo, constipation, hot flashes, and nausea, were reported in only 3 of the 20 studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In people with type 2 diabetes, turmeric/curcumin supplementation led to improvements in body weight, waist circumference, body fat percentage, and hip circumference, but not BMI or waist-to-hip ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For those with prediabetes, supplements significantly reduced body weight and waist circumference, but again had no effect on BMI.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found significant associations between dosage and waist circumference, and between duration of supplementation and body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of the study authors, &lt;a href="https://cv.tums.ac.ir/en/cv/Leila_Azadbakht" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Leila Azadbakht&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, professor of nutritional Sciences, and &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mohammadreza-Baniasadi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Mohammadreza Moradi Baniasadi&lt;/a&gt;, MSc in the Department of Community Nutrition at the School of Nutritional Sciences and Dietetics, both at Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran, commented on their findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; that “the most useful finding is the dose-response relationship: Supplementation for [more than] 22 weeks significantly reduced body weight —[weighted mean difference of] -2.5 kg — and doses [of more than] 15,00 mg/day lowered waist circumference — [weighted mean difference of] -1.8 cm — in [type 2 diabetes] patients.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This provides practical guidance for clinicians on optimal dosing and duration to achieve meaningful effects, highlighting the potential of turmeric/curcumin as an adjunct to lifestyle interventions for weight control in diabetes management,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pure.atu.ie/en/persons/eamon-laird" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Eamon Laird&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, assistant lecturer in Human Nutrition at Atlantic Technological University Sligo, and adjunct assistant professor at Trinity College Dublin, not involved in the study explained for &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Turmeric/curcumin could influence metabolism, reducing inflammation, and potentially impacting (reducing) appetite. Some studies suggest curcumin can enhance thermogenesis (calorie burning for heat production), which could contribute to weight loss over time. Additionally, curcumin’s anti-inflammatory properties may help counteract some of the inflammation (cytokines) associated with obesity and diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/does-turmeric-help-you-lose-weight#research" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Several studies&lt;/a&gt; have suggested that turmeric may help with weight loss, but there is little clear evidence as to how it has its effects, as Azadbakht and Baniasadi told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“While the precise mechanism remains somewhat enigmatic, we believe the activation of &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Nature" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrm.2017.95" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;AMPK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; and the anti-inflammatory properties are the most likely primary modes, as they directly link to improved insulin sensitivity, reduced chronic inflammation — common in [type 2 diabetes] and prediabetes‚ and enhanced fat metabolism,” the study authors explained.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laird welcomed the study as interesting but highlighted “significant limitations to consider before getting too excited.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Firstly,” he told &lt;em&gt;MNT,&lt;/em&gt; “out of the 20 studies in the analysis 13 are from the same country (Iran). This limits the potential effects/applicability to the general public as there could be just something unique about that population whether it be genetics or just other dietary or other components not controlled for.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, there was a wide range of doses and forms of the product used, wide variations in the study duration whilst the majority of the studies were in mostly older female adults,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azadbakht and Baniasadi outlined how they hope to address these issues, noting: “We are considering further research to address limitations in the current evidence base. This includes larger, longer-term [&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/280574" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;randomized controlled trials&lt;/a&gt;] focusing on high-absorption formulations and combinations with lifestyle interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also aim to explore effects in diverse populations (e.g. varying ethnicities or comorbidities) and investigate mechanistic pathways more deeply […] to better predict responders and optimize safety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research is encouraging, but we need to be cautious. The overall effect sizes are small, and the certainty of evidence is low to moderate, meaning stronger, larger trials are still needed. […] For patients, the takeaway is that turmeric can be a helpful addition to a healthy lifestyle, but it’s not a shortcut to weight loss. Clinicians should frame it as a ‘supportive therapy’ alongside established treatments, like lifestyle and medications, for diabetes and obesity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Thomas M.

While prevalence varies by region, in the Americas and Southeast Asia, the rates are above 40%. But that’s not the most concerning part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research reveals that metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), may ramp up the chances of heart failure, even when traditional risk factors like obesity or diabetes are accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often symptomless, the condition goes undetected, yet its impact extends far beyond liver health. This isn’t just about the liver anymore; it’s a wake-up call for heart health, and in extension, overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What exactly is Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://liverfoundation.org/liver-diseases/fatty-liver-disease/nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; is a condition where excess fat builds up in the liver, not caused by heavy alcohol consumption. It's often linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of conditions, from simple fat buildup (NAFL) to more serious inflammation and scarring (NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis, or may even lead to liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a condition where excess fat builds up in the liver, not caused by excessive alcohol consumption. Essentially, it's the new term for what was previously known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). MASLD is associated with metabolic risk factors like obesity, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fatty liver and heart failure: A hidden link&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While MASLD is often thought of as a liver condition, health experts warn that heart disease is the leading cause of death in people with fatty liver, even more so than liver complications.

The results were eye-opening: 17.9% of these individuals developed heart failure, and nearly 48% showed signs of possible heart trouble, without ever being diagnosed by doctors. The risk was greatest among older adults, women, and those with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is the first to use liver biopsy, the gold standard, for MASLD diagnosis and then directly assess heart failure outcomes. It highlights a major blind spot: many people with fatty liver aren’t being monitored for heart issues, which could mean missed opportunities for early detection and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How strong is the evidence?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;MASLD has already been &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/ATV.0000000000000153" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;recognized as an independent risk factor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, artery-clogging conditions that lead to heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35879047/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;major meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; involving over 11 million people across multiple countries found that NAFLD carries a 1.5-fold greater risk of developing heart failure, independent of other factors like age, diabetes, or obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2023.1167608/full" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Other studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; show that MASLD and heart failure share common risk factors like insulin resistance, obesity, and chronic inflammation. MASLD can promote harmful changes in heart structure and function (especially in preventing proper heart muscle relaxation, a type of heart failure called HFpEF).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more alarming, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40689063/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;heart-failure-related death rates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; among people with NAFLD have doubled in the US over the past two decades, highlighting sharp increases in risk, especially among women and certain ethnic groups in rural or Southern areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9493675/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;cohort studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, including those using the UK Biobank dataset, have shown MASLD is linked to higher overall mortality, cardiovascular deaths, and major cardiac events, even among non-drinkers. Research published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2018.11.050" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Journal of the American College of Cardiology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; confirms that patients with MASLD face greater risks of cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, and atherosclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does this mean, and why does this matter?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does fatty liver hurt the heart? As per research, inflammation and insulin resistance triggered by fat-laden liver cells can damage blood vessels and the heart. In addition, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/19/10595" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;endothelial dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, oxidative stress, and systemic inflammation play major roles in causing arterial stiffness and reduced heart function. Apart from that, fatty liver reflects a state of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;metabolic imbalance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, which overlaps with high blood lipid levels, hypertension, and diabetes – all contributors to cardiovascular strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the findings from various research highlight the importance of early detection and management of MASLD, not just to protect the liver, but also to safeguard the heart. How to approach that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Importance of early detection:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Recognizing MASLD isn’t just about liver health. It could be the first sign of heart vulnerability. Early detection of both conditions can transform outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Better screening to save lives:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Experts recommend that adults with MASLD, especially those with diabetes or high cholesterol, should also be screened for heart issues like diastolic dysfunction or heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Treating both conditions together:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Emerging &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00951-2" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;clinical guidance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; suggests medications such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs, SGLT-2 inhibitors, and others may benefit patients who have both MASLD and heart failure while reducing inflammation and improving outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty liver, often without any connection to alcohol, can quietly increase the risk of serious heart problems like heart failure. With nearly one in five affected over a decade, and strong evidence showing a 1.5times higher risk, this is more than a liver issue; it’s a heart warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, with regular screenings and simple yet effective lifestyle changes, we can intercept this dual threat. Consult your healthcare provider in case you, or anyone you know, belongs to a high-risk group; your liver health may be the key to protecting your heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Long, irregular menstrual cycles in women put them at higher risk of fatty liver disease: Study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="91"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="92"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 04:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>根据科学，生姜有益健康的5种方法- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxNSFFRQnpKQ0kxNGhqTVNRczZxTmRsRVRKOE16eC02ejE2NEhBQ29sU0VidmJqY0JFd3JiOUh2WXJjM01UR09FZDB5WFBHVGduZlZaQUhnQ20wczQ4V0ZVNFp1N0VST21oM2Q4R3ZJQWxSbkwtRXdUaWVEdlY3MVpSTEd4LXh3NWxvTUx5ME11MWw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;From warming winter teas to zesty stir-fries, ginger (&lt;em&gt;Zingiber officinale&lt;/em&gt;) has long been a kitchen staple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But beyond its culinary charm, this spicy root has a rich history in traditional medicine – and modern science is catching up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies now show that ginger may offer a wide range of health benefits, from easing nausea and relieving colds to reducing inflammation and supporting heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-3-common-spices-could-be-interfering-with-your-medication"&gt;These 3 Common Spices Could Be Interfering With Your Medication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Nausea relief&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7019938/"&gt;Multiple clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; have shown consistent evidence that ginger can reduce nausea and vomiting, particularly when compared to a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="170647" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/symptoms/feeling-sick-nausea/"&gt;NHS even recommends&lt;/a&gt; ginger-containing foods or teas for easing nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger seems especially effective for nausea during pregnancy. In small doses, it's considered a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16131535/"&gt;safe and effective option&lt;/a&gt; for people who don't respond well to standard anti-nausea treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also promising evidence that ginger can help with chemotherapy-induced nausea, though &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92775/"&gt;results are mixed&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to motion sickness and post-surgery nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe ginger's anti-nausea effects may work by &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92775/"&gt;blocking serotonin receptors&lt;/a&gt; and acting on both the gut and brain. It may also help by reducing gas and bloating in the digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Anti-inflammatory benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger is rich in &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44187-025-00280-2#Tab2"&gt;bioactive compounds&lt;/a&gt;, such as gingerol and shogaol, which have strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research suggests ginger supplements may help regulate inflammation, especially in autoimmune conditions. &lt;a href="https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/172011"&gt;One study found&lt;/a&gt; that ginger reduced the activity of neutrophils – white blood cells that often become overactive in diseases like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and antiphospholipid syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neutrophils produce &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6874304/"&gt;extracellular traps&lt;/a&gt; (NETs), which are web-like structures used to trap and kill pathogens. But when NETs form excessively, they can fuel autoimmune diseases. In the study, taking ginger daily for one week significantly reduced NET formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study used ginger supplements, it's unclear whether fresh ginger or tea has the same effect. Still, the findings suggest ginger may be a helpful, natural option for people with certain autoimmune conditions – though more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger also has &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/87559129.2019.1573829#:%7E:text=Results%20indicate%20that%20ginger%20contains,interesting%20alternative%20to%20synthetic%20antimicrobials."&gt;antimicrobial properties&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it can help combat bacteria,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="170647" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; and other harmful microbes. Combined with its anti-inflammatory effects, this makes ginger a popular remedy for easing cold and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="170647" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; symptoms like sore throats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Pain management&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to pain, the research on ginger is encouraging – though not conclusive. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3665023/#ref10"&gt;Some studies show&lt;/a&gt; that ginger extract can reduce knee pain and stiffness in people with osteoarthritis, especially during the early stages of treatment. However, results vary, and not everyone experiences the same level of relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For muscle pain, &lt;a href="https://www.jpain.org/article/S1526-5900(09)00915-8/fulltext"&gt;one study found&lt;/a&gt; that taking two grams of ginger daily for 11 days reduced soreness after exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger may also ease menstrual pain. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1028455918302304"&gt;some studies suggest&lt;/a&gt; its effectiveness rivals that of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe ginger works by &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44187-025-00280-2#Tab2"&gt;activating pathways&lt;/a&gt; in the nervous system that dampen pain signals. It may also inhibit inflammatory chemicals like prostaglandins and leukotrienes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Heart health and diabetes support&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure, high blood sugar and elevated "bad" cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein or LDL cholesterol) are all risk factors for heart disease. Ginger may help with all three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36165525/"&gt;2022 review&lt;/a&gt; of 26  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="170647" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; found that ginger supplementation can significantly improve cholesterol levels — lowering triglycerides, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, while raising HDL ("good") cholesterol. It may also &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30972845/"&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="170647" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, ginger could offer additional benefits. A &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2018/5692962"&gt;review of ten studies&lt;/a&gt; found that taking one to three grams of ginger daily for four to 12 weeks helped improve both cholesterol levels and blood sugar control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These benefits appear to come from &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3519348/#:%7E:text=Abstract,also%20discussed%20in%20this%20update."&gt;multiple mechanisms&lt;/a&gt;, including improved insulin sensitivity, enhanced glucose uptake in cells, and reduced oxidative stress. Ginger's anti-inflammatory actions may also contribute to its heart-protective effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36809190/"&gt;early research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that ginger may also offer &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ginger-for-sex"&gt;benefits for sexual health&lt;/a&gt;, though evidence in humans is still limited. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6316093/"&gt;Animal studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that ginger can boost testosterone levels, improve blood flow, and enhance sexual behaviour. In traditional medicine systems, it has long been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4377061/"&gt;used as an aphrodisiac&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there's not yet strong clinical evidence to confirm a direct impact on libido, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12007927/"&gt;ginger's anti-inflammatory&lt;/a&gt;, circulatory and hormonal effects could play a supportive role, particularly for people managing conditions like diabetes or oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Brain health and cancer research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence suggests ginger may also offer &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8971783/"&gt;neuroprotective&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92775/"&gt;anti-cancer&lt;/a&gt; benefits. Lab-based studies show that ginger compounds can help protect brain cells from oxidative damage – a key factor in neurodegenerative diseases like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="170647" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other in-vitro research has found that ginger can slow the growth of some  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="170647" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; cells. However, these findings are still in early stages and more research is needed to confirm their relevance in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger is generally safe when consumed in food or tea. But like any supplement, it should be used in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170653" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170653" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ginger_tea_642.jpg" alt="ginger tea" class="wp-image-170653 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ginger_tea_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ginger_tea_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ginger_tea_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170653" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Ginger is safe to drink in moderation as a tea. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEmDGoaNQg/"&gt;Bigc Studio/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doses above &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK565886/"&gt;four grams a day&lt;/a&gt; may cause &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7019938/"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt; such as heartburn, bloating, diarrhoea or mouth irritation. These are usually mild and temporary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK565886/"&gt;Certain groups&lt;/a&gt; should use caution with high doses. Ginger may increase bleeding risk in people on blood thinners (like warfarin, aspirin or clopidogrel), and it can enhance the effects of diabetes or blood pressure medications, potentially leading to low blood sugar or blood pressure. Pregnant women should also consult a doctor before using high doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So ginger isn't just a fragrant kitchen spice – it's a natural remedy with growing scientific support. For most people, enjoying ginger in food or tea is a safe and effective way to tap into its therapeutic potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're considering taking supplements, it's always best to speak with your doctor or pharmacist first, especially if you're managing a medical condition or taking medication.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261506/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

And when he died this year at the age of 76, many were saddened but also surprised that it hadn't happened earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ql-align-justify"&gt;“[He] had lived on the edge for such a long time, the fact he lived as long as he did was a miracle,” the rocker's close friend, Tom Morello &lt;a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/frail-ozzy-osbourne-knew-he-was-dying-says-friend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; on a radio show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ql-align-justify"&gt;It turns out the miracle was in his genes. You see, Osbourne had a rare genetic mutation that allowed him to metabolize alcohol and other substances much faster than normal. And this, say scientists, is what kept him alive despite decades of self-destructive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ql-align-justify"&gt;That interesting fact is one of many that can be found on an Instagram page called &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;.
