Despite their name, though, they belong to an entirely different family of fungi, the Gyromitra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;False morels contain compounds called hydrazines that are toxic to the nervous system. While eating one may cause abdominal pain and diarrhea, in severe cases, a false morel can cause seizures and multi-organ failure. Gyromitrin, the main toxin in the mushroom, is also a carcinogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recently, scientists believe they've found a link between false morels and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14606543/footage-impact-motor-neurone-disease-healthy-woman.html"&gt;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (ALS) in Montchavin, as a mysterious cluster of cases has developed over the last decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and, in some parts of the world, motor neurone disease, ALS is a fatal neurological disorder that progressively paralyzes patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Montchavin has a permanent population of about 200 people, and the average global diagnosis rate of ALS is two to three diagnoses per 100,000 people annually. Yet in the last decade, there have been 16 cases reported in Montchavin, far more than what would be expected.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Over a period of about 10 years, 16 residents of a ski village in the French Alps, out of a population of 200, had ALS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If made comparable to a rate in 100,000 people per year, Montchavin's rate would be 800 cases per 100,000 residents per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The search for answers was led by Dr Emmeline Lagrange, a neurologist practicing at Grenoble University Hospital, 84 miles southwest of the village. A resident of Montchavin who had been experiencing neurological issues had been referred to Lagrange, who diagnosed them with ALS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She would later learn on a call with the patient’s referring physician in Montchavin that this was one of several ALS cases in the small mountain village.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;None of the patients had a gene mutation making them more susceptible to ALS or a family history of the disease, which causes continuously worsening paralysis over time, leading to death after two to five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists are still investigating the cause of ALS, which affects roughly 33,000 Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Genetics are behind between 10 and 15 percent of cases, while the rest could be tied to environmental exposures, including toxic pollution, smoking, exposure to heavy metals like lead and mercury, and a history of head injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lagrange published an abstract summarizing her investigation into the unusual ALS cluster, which caught the eye of environmental neuroscientist Dr Peter Spencer of the Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University in Portland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Spencer is the leading proponent of a separate theory linking food to the degenerative disease.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His theory was that toxins in cycad seeds, once a staple of Guam’s Chamorro people, triggered an epidemic of Western Pacific ALS-Parkinsonism dementia (ALS-PDC). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At its peak, ALS-PDC was 50 to 100 times more common in Guam than ALS rates worldwide. In the 1950s, incidence rates reached about 200 per 100,000 among Chamorro adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He has investigated the link for over four decades, arguing that a compound in cycad seeds called cycasin metabolizes into a neurotoxic DNA-damaging byproduct called methylazoxymethanol (MAM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MAM is also formed when the body metabolizes hydrazine, a volatile chemical used in rocket fuels and also found in false morels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;A true morel is a gourmet delicacy, though it must be properly cooked or could be poisonous. True morels are often featured in Michelin-starred restaurants and in high-end cuisine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The false morel [shown] is often reddish-brown, whereas true morels are typically green or gray. False morels are also a different shape and has brain-like folds and ridges&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Spencer saw a presentation of Lagrange’s abstract, his mind lingered on one line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/health-disease/2024/did-eating-false-mushrooms-cause-als-french-village"&gt;Knowable Magazine&lt;/a&gt;: ‘I noted that among the foodstuffs they reported were mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And I asked them what type of mushrooms, because one particular type contains poisons associated with the Guam problem.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They began collaborating on a study. Lagrange had learned that the ALS patients in Montchavin had been purposely seeking out false morels, believing they had rejuvenating properties, despite their illegal status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A villager told Lagrange: ‘They are always in a group, a secret group, a social network, and they eat the mushrooms. And they all knew that it’s forbidden.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers included those patients in their study, as well as 48 villagers without the disease who ate wild mushrooms, but not false morels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some ALS patients had a history of collecting up to six pounds of the poisonous fungi during the spring and summer and eating them throughout the year. People who had been diagnosed with ALS had been eating the mushrooms for as long as 20 years before ALS symptoms arose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘All ALS cases but none of the controls had a history of consuming acutely poisonous False Morels, notably the Snow Morel Gyromitra gigas,’ Lagrange &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.jns-journal.com/article/S0022-510X(21)00252-5/fulltext"&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Neuroscientist Emmeline Lagrange spearheaded the investigation into the ALS cluster in the French Alps, determining from a lengthy investigation that ALS patients shared something in common: their love for false morels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Since no other significant chemical or physical exposure was found, the primary risk factor for ALS in this community appears to be repeated ingestion of these neurotoxic fungi.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the false morel’s toxicity, it is a delicacy in parts of Scandinavia, where Michelin-starred restaurants incorporate it on seasonal menus for its tang and nuttiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Finns are such big fans that the species was featured on a 1974 postage stamp. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;False morels are also endorsed by the Finnish Food Authority, which advises people to repeatedly boil and rinse fresh or dried specimens before eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite their differences in appearance, amateur foragers often confuse true morels with false ones, which resemble a reddish brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A June 2024 Toxicon study identified &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0041010124003970?via%3Dihub"&gt;118 false morel poisonings&lt;/a&gt; in Michigan between 2002 and 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most of the patients suffered from vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, while over a dozen developed liver damage.

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The researchers studied brain tissue of about 400 people post mortem, as well as blood samples and a battery of memory tests performed yearly before their death. The scientists found higher levels of lithium in cognitively healthy people. But as sticky clumps of protein, known as amyloid plaques, began forming in their brains in the early stages of dementia, the amyloid trapped the lithium, restraining it and reducing its availability to surrounding brain cells. That depleted the lithium even in parts of the brain that were amyloid-free, essentially reducing lithium’s protective function.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The researchers also fed healthy mice a lithium-restricted diet, spurring memory problems: they had trouble performing several laboratory memory tests. And finally, the researchers were also able to reverse disease-related damage and restore memory function, even in older mice with advanced disease, by returning lithium to their diet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="flex align_items_base justify_space_between heading-container"&gt;&lt;h3 id="what_kind_of_lithium_was_used_in" class="heading | bold font_secondary gutter_20_0--mobile

They used &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11954165/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11954165/"&gt;lithium orotate,&lt;/a&gt; which is a compound that is able to evade the sticky amyloid plaques in our brains. The type of lithium used to treat psychiatric disorders is lithium carbonate, but it can be &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5537577/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5537577/"&gt;hard on people’s kidneys&lt;/a&gt; and toxic to elderly patients. The amount of lithium orotate used by the Harvard team was one-thousandth the level, essentially mimicking the amount naturally found in the brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="flex align_items_base justify_space_between heading-container"&gt;&lt;h3 id="should_you_buy_lithium_online_or_in" class="heading | bold font_secondary gutter_20_0--mobile

So there’s no way to tell whether the substance actually contains lithium and, if so, in what amounts, or whether it contains contaminants. Generally, a firm does not have to provide the FDA with the evidence it relies on to substantiate safety before or after it markets its products.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="flex align_items_base justify_space_between heading-container"&gt;&lt;h3 id="how_else_should_i_get_lithium_in" class="heading | bold font_secondary gutter_20_0--mobile

&lt;p&gt;Chopping onions is a fundamental cooking skill that many home chefs dread due to the inevitable tears that follow. Recent scientific research from Cornell University has finally provided a definitive answer to this culinary conundrum. Their findings reveal that the key to tear-free onion cutting lies in two simple factors: using a sharp knife and cutting slowly. This breakthrough could transform how we approach this essential kitchen task and make meal preparation more enjoyable for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The science behind onion tears&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you slice into an onion, you’re breaking open cells that contain enzymes and sulfur compounds. These components mix together and create syn-propanethial-S-oxide, a volatile gas that rises through the air and irritates the sensitive membranes in your eyes. Your eyes respond to this irritation by producing tears to wash away the irritant.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Scientists at Cornell University conducted detailed experiments to understand exactly how this irritating compound gets released during cutting. Using a specially designed guillotine fitted with different blades, they meticulously documented the spray patterns produced when cutting onions under various conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The research team captured high-speed footage&lt;/strong&gt; of onion juice ejection during cutting, allowing them to analyze precisely how much spray was produced and what factors influenced it. This methodical approach finally provided scientific validation for what many chefs have long suspected about knife sharpness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The relationship between our dietary choices and bodily functions extends beyond cooking techniques. Research has shown that &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/the-brain-can-change-intestinal-bacteria-in-a-couple-of-hours/"&gt;the brain can change intestinal bacteria in a couple of hours&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting how interconnected our body systems truly are.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Sharp knives create fewer tears&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Cornell study conclusively demonstrated that knife sharpness plays a crucial role in determining how much onion spray is produced during cutting. &lt;em&gt;Dull blades significantly increase both the speed and number of ejected droplets&lt;/em&gt; that carry the tear-inducing compound.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When using a blunt knife, the researchers observed that the blade tends to push down on the onion’s layers before actually cutting through them. This compression forces the layers to bend inward, storing elastic energy. As the cut progresses, these compressed layers spring back, forcefully ejecting juice into the air – and ultimately into your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In contrast, sharp blades slice cleanly through the onion’s cellular structure with minimal compression. This precision cutting reduces the amount of juice that gets sprayed into the surrounding air, resulting in fewer tears for the person doing the chopping.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a healthy lifestyle includes not just proper cooking techniques but also regular exercise. Studies show that &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/take-10000-steps-a-day-if-you-can-well-but-already-7000-they-keep-in-health/"&gt;taking 7,000 steps daily can significantly improve health&lt;/a&gt;, making it an achievable goal for most people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cutting speed matters&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second critical factor identified by the Cornell researchers was cutting speed. Contrary to what many might assume, &lt;strong&gt;faster cutting actually produces more tears&lt;/strong&gt;, not fewer. The research team found that rapid cutting motions generated more juice and created a finer mist of the irritating compound that more easily reaches the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Slowing down your cutting motion allows for more control and precision, which results in less spray. This measured approach might take a few extra seconds, but the comfort gained is well worth the minimal additional time investment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are the key techniques to implement for tear-free onion cutting:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a professionally sharpened chef’s knife&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Cut with deliberate, slow movements&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Minimize compression of the onion layers&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Maintain proper ventilation in your kitchen&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Consider chilling the onion briefly before cutting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding how we interact with food extends beyond cooking techniques. Research indicates that &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/there-is-a-lost-memory-of-the-meals-that-makes-us-eat-more-than-necessary/"&gt;there is a lost memory of meals that makes us eat more than necessary&lt;/a&gt;, showing how our relationship with food is influenced by psychological factors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our early development can also affect our overall health trajectory. Studies have found that &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/growth-in-the-first-1000-days-of-life-affects-adult-stature/"&gt;growth in the first 1,000 days of life affects adult stature&lt;/a&gt;, emphasizing the importance of proper nutrition from an early age.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Additional benefits beyond comfort&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Cornell researchers noted that adopting these proper cutting techniques offers benefits beyond just preventing tears. &lt;em&gt;Minimizing airborne spray during food preparation can reduce the spread of potential pathogens in kitchen environments&lt;/em&gt;, contributing to overall food safety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is particularly important when cutting vegetables with tough outer layers that store significant elastic energy. The proper technique not only improves comfort but also supports better kitchen hygiene practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent medical research has identified interesting connections between medications and mental health, such as &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/a-new-connection-between-the-competitive-drugs-of-the-glp-1-and-the-depression/"&gt;a new connection between GLP-1 drugs and depression&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting the complex interplay between different body systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Food waste remains a significant issue in modern society. Studies have shown that &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/the-invisible-food-waste-of-the-canteens-a-chasm-of-costs-and-food-thrown/"&gt;the invisible food waste in canteens creates enormous costs&lt;/a&gt;, making efficient food preparation techniques all the more important.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The broader impact of proper technique&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mastering the art of onion cutting not only improves your culinary experience but also contributes to better health outcomes. &lt;strong&gt;Reducing eye irritation makes cooking more enjoyable&lt;/strong&gt;, potentially encouraging more home-cooked meals. This can lead to healthier eating patterns and greater control over ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The precision skills developed through proper cutting techniques transfer to other aspects of cooking as well. Improving knife skills generally leads to more consistent food preparation, better presentation, and ultimately more satisfying meals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regular physical activity complements good nutrition for overall health. Research has shown that &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/exercise-fights-cancer-now-we-understand-how/"&gt;exercise fights cancer through specific biological mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; that scientists are now beginning to understand fully.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The humble onion, found in cuisines worldwide from Italian pasta sauces to Indian curries, no longer needs to be a source of kitchen frustration. With the scientifically validated combination of a sharp knife and slow cutting motion, you can incorporate this flavorful vegetable into your cooking without reaching for tissues or resorting to swimming goggles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

It was first detected in Southeast Asia in January but didn’t appear in U.S. surveillance reports until May.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization classified XFG as a “variant under monitoring” in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting a full picture of COVID-19 activity can be difficult given shifting priorities in federal and state health policy. But several key measures help put together a picture of what’s happening in Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;CDC: COVID-19 Cases Likely Growing Again In Minnesota&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;As of July 29, the CDC estimates a 91.85 percent probability that COVID-19 is growing in Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state’s epidemic trend is officially classified as growing, with a reproductive rate (Rt) of 1.05, meaning each infection is leading to more than one new case.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Emergency department visits for COVID-19 remain very low, making up just 0.38 percent of total ED visits statewide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;National Picture&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Projections show infections are growing or likely to grow in 40 states and are unchanged in nine others. The highest rates of transmission are in the South, Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, and Midwest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CDC also said COVID viral activity in wastewater remains “low” nationally, though at least 10 states had “high” or “very high” levels as of July 12.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Minnesota, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;wastewater viral activity is currently low, with 25 sites reporting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although hoarseness appears to be unique to Stratus, other common symptoms include fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, loss of taste or smell, fatigue, muscle and body aches, headache, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health experts say the Stratus variant may be better than others at evading immunity. While vaccine guidance is evolving, the CDC still says COVID-19 vaccination helps protect against severe illness, hospitalization, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 14:26:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxPVTNwRDRYTW1PNENYMl9SWTNvSm1vYzhVby0wNmtIZXF0ZWlYZm1GSlItY1ZFRl9HTTI5clY5bkVsb3p6cVFRMVZuU3ZHcnBVbkhsWW9NQ1NpN2poSlRScC1nZjR5eDdDNVlZY3JYc2xCVm8yUUFXanRsczc2OE53WHA2Q1JfUlNsYWE4dGxvOWIxNXFiOFlV0gG3AUFVX3lxTE5UbEZVT0I5RWtDc0RoZ3ZCQ0ZpN3YwVUVyUzVZM1EzZk5xZVZ4b2pURW1WVWJYaDE3ak5RWTBkXzE3MXVyY1cyanhOOTNJZGRPTGxwc2xkYWxDV0hnWEZQUF96Sjg0MmJ3UmtqWjhTTUVSbEZQRnM0Z1Z6UjRaQktjOXliQkVJa2NrZUZnbGVwTE94b08zdjNuUEZFVzRMZUt5RGZxbGR0V3lLN2pNb3lfR1Fqd1dlbw</guid></item><item><title>纽约市的退伍军人疾病集群导致3人死亡， 70多人患病。它是什么，您如何获得它？ - yahoo.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi_wFBVV95cUxOdnFTRzQ1MGp0OE1tNnBKRWFBVWlkNUw4cDczYVBwWlhCSW90UFduRE4zR19pbFdJZkNGR29zb0MyN3B1UUdaRGxVWmZWX1hROEtTVV9UMzlfQWFrX05IbUEtazNObXdZNGhaYU1XUXVzVkJVbTgwZ0tWUkhtVDdGM1VNNmVCTjRvSWtPZVZfeE5YbVF0Y19TRThtV2FCODNXV0hFUkwybzhWUFFwUUhfYXBwZ3h3RFV0eS1VX2wwOXNMbU5vZ3dCRDhZTVFrZkU2aXhJUHp2WkswQ1pLVWdzUEhYOV9OWTFqdjlkY0tmMldGcUZaNTVDUGtHSXpWajg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Three people have died and over 70 people have been sickened by Legionnaires’ disease amid a cluster discovered in central Harlem in New York City, according to an update from &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/legionnaires-disease.page" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:health officials Wednesday;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;health officials Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The disease was initially detected on July 25.

			&lt;p&gt;A common type of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus_infection"&gt;human papillomavirus&lt;/a&gt; (HPV) could be more dangerous than we thought. The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="169949" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt;, known as beta-HPV, was thought in rare cases to contribute to skin  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="169949" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; by worsening UV damage, but a new study suggests it can actually hijack the body's cells to directly drive cancer growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These fresh conclusions came from a study of a 34-year-old woman who sought medical help for &lt;a href="https://dermnetnz.org/topics/cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma"&gt;cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma&lt;/a&gt; (cSCC) on her forehead. Her tumors were repeatedly growing back, even after immunotherapy and surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/modified-herpes-virus-found-to-shrink-deadly-skin-cancers-in-clinical-trial"&gt;Modified Herpes Virus Found to Shrink Deadly Skin Cancers in Clinical Trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A closer genetic analysis revealed something surprising: the beta-HPV had actually integrated itself into the DNA of the woman's tumor, where it was producing viral proteins that helped the cancer thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before now, beta-HPV had never been found to integrate into cellular DNA, let alone actively maintain a cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It suggests that there may be more people out there with aggressive forms of cSCC who have an underlying immune defect and could benefit from treatments targeting the immune system," &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/beta-hpv-can-directly-cause-skin-cancer-immunocompromised-people"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; immunologist Andrea Lisco from the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman who was the subject of this study had an inherited immune disorder, one which prevented her &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"&gt;T cells&lt;/a&gt; from attacking HPV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169952" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169952" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ProteinChart.jpg" alt="ZAP70 proteins" class="wp-image-169952 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ProteinChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ProteinChart-600x349.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169952" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Issues with the ZAP70 protein were key to the research. (Ye et al., &lt;em&gt;NEJM&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While tests revealed that the woman's immune system could still repair DNA damage from UV radiation – the typical cause of cSCC – the impairment of her T cells meant the beta-HPV could invade her skin cells and trigger the formation of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;T&lt;span&gt;he immunocompromised woman was also being treated for other HPV-related illnesses, including warts on the skin and in the mouth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the cause of her condition was discovered, the patient received a bone marrow &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/stem-cell-transplant"&gt;stem cell transplant&lt;/a&gt;, to replace her dysfunctional T cells with healthy ones. This cleared up the aggressive skin cancer and her other HPV-caused issues, none of which returned during a three-year follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This discovery and successful outcome would not have been possible without the combined expertise of virologists, immunologists, oncologists and transplant specialists, all working under the same roof," &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/beta-hpv-can-directly-cause-skin-cancer-immunocompromised-people"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Lisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study by no means minimizes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sunlight-can-still-damage-skin-through-a-closed-window-heres-how"&gt;the role of UV radiation&lt;/a&gt; as a cause of skin cancer, but shows that there are other factors at work too. In rare cases like this, normally benign &lt;span&gt;viruses&lt;/span&gt; can have devastating effects in people with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That emphasizes the need for targeted, personalized &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-3-strategies-can-improve-outcomes-for-cancer-patients"&gt;cancer treatments&lt;/a&gt; that may well be more effective than conventional and generic approaches. It's likely that the woman involved in this study is far from the only one with this set of conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reason to be hopeful could come from progress against a related disease. Alpha-HPV is known as the cause of many cervical and throat cancers, and widespread vaccination against the virus has resulted in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/young-american-deaths-from-cervical-cancer-fall-sharply-after-hpv-vaccine"&gt;drastic drop&lt;/a&gt; in deaths from those cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a single, universal cure for cancer remains elusive, we are continuing to see steadily improving &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experimental-drug-helped-cancer-patients-live-40-longer-in-clinical-trial"&gt;survival and recovery rates&lt;/a&gt; across many cancer types, including cSCC – something this new research should also help with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This discovery could completely change how we think about the development, and consequently the treatment, of cSCC in people who have a health condition that compromises immune function," &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/beta-hpv-can-directly-cause-skin-cancer-immunocompromised-people"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Lisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2502114"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            The human brain shrinks as it ages, affecting the ability to remember — it’s part of life. Yet there are a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/26/health/superager-secrets-good-memory-wellness"&gt;lucky few, called “SuperAgers,”&lt;/a&gt; who possess a brain that fights back. For these people, memories stay as sharp as they were 30 or more years in the past.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480000p3b6nuknd13oe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Carol Siegler, who lives in the Chicago suburb of Palatine, is a SuperAger. At 82, she won the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament for her age group, which she said she entered “as a gag.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480000q3b6npajp63fm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’ve auditioned twice for ‘Jeopardy!’ and did well enough on it to be invited to the live auditions. Then Covid hit,” Siegler told me in 2022, when she was 85.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480000r3b6nm406t2k0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Today, Siegler is still going strong, well on her way to her 90th birthday, said Tamar Gefen, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Mesulam Institute for Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer’s Disease at Northwestern University in Chicago.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480000s3b6nnros55as@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Gefen conducts research at &lt;a href="https://www.brain.northwestern.edu/join/SuperAging.html" target="_blank"&gt;Northwestern’s SuperAging Program&lt;/a&gt;, which is currently studying 113 SuperAgers. Over the past 25 years, however, 80 SuperAgers have donated their brain tissue to the program, which has led to some fascinating discoveries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480000t3b6n0i6anhh4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            CNN spoke to Gefen about those decades of work. She is a coauthor of a new analysis of the research that was published Thursday in &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70312" target="_blank"&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/a&gt;, the journal of the Alzheimer’s Association.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480000u3b6nr2n00ao8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How do you define a SuperAger, and what have you found out about their behavior over the years?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480000v3b6ndn91795l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Tamar Gefen:&lt;/strong&gt; To be a SuperAger in our program at Northwestern, a person must be over 80 and undergo extensive cognitive testing. Acceptance in the study only occurs if the person’s episodic memory — the ability to recall everyday events and past personal history — is as good or better than cognitively normal people in their 50s and 60s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480000w3b6n7yh00u99@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            We have screened close to 2,000 individuals who think they may be a SuperAger and less than 10% meet the criteria. Over the past 25 years, we have studied about 300 SuperAgers — a number of whom have donated their brain for research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480000x3b6nkqnw5j7a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One key trait of SuperAgers is that they seem to be highly social people. They value connection and are often active in their communities. This is interesting because we know isolation is a risk factor for developing  dementia, and so staying socially active is a known protective feature.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480000y3b6nity3vqbs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another common thread in all SuperAgers is a sense of autonomy, freedom and independence. They’re making decisions and living their lives the way that they want to live.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480000z3b6nt099y0o8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I feel very strongly that successful aging is not just about sociability. If a person feels trapped, tethered or burdened, especially in a vulnerable state like poor health or older age, I think it can encroach on their entire psychosocial being.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            But as far as healthy behaviors, SuperAgers run the gamut. We have SuperAgers with heart disease, diabetes, who aren’t physically active, who don’t eat any better than their similar age peers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb48000113b6nkmeou58e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is one SuperAger who drinks four beers every night. He laughs and says, “Maybe it’s done me wrong, but I’ll never know.” He doesn’t have an identical twin to compare his behavior to, so would he have lived to 108 instead of 98? We don’t know.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Many of your most intriguing discoveries have come from studying donor brain tissue. What have you discovered about the memory center of the SuperAger brain?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb48000133b6nqtv2k92x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Gefen: &lt;/strong&gt; Our &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25632151/" target="_blank"&gt;studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; that an area of the brain that is responsible for attention, motivation, and cognitive engagement — known as the cingulate cortex — is thicker in SuperAgers, even compared with those of people in their 50s and 60s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb48000143b6nk1hivyjv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the hippocampus, the memory center of the brain, we found SuperAgers have three times fewer tau tangles when compared to their “normal” peers. Abnormal formations of tau proteins are one of the key signs of Alzheimer’s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb48000153b6ncaivddou@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Alzheimer’s disease, tau also targets the neurons of the primary neurons of the cholinergic system — which is responsible for sustaining our attention in daily life. But that doesn’t happen in the brain of a SuperAger. Therefore, the cholinergic system appears to be stronger, and likely more plastic and flexible for reasons that we’re not sure about.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb48000163b6ngx94ktu7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s interesting, because I see SuperAgers as focused. They can pay close attention, engage and actively listen. How else could they recall 13 out of 15 random words after 30 minutes?  I picture them engraving the words on their cortex with a chisel.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb48000173b6ng7h24yn0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            SuperAger brains also have bigger, healthier cells in the entorhinal cortex, an area essential for memory and learning, that has direct connections to the hippocampus. The entorhinal cortex, by the way, is one of the first areas of the brain to get hit by Alzheimer’s disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb48000183b6nkfsm8uvh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36180225/" target="_blank"&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; we examined every layer of cells within the entorhinal cortex of SuperAgers, and we painstakingly measured the size of the neurons. We found that in layer two, which is the layer that is most important for information transmission, SuperAgers had humongous, plump, intact, beautiful, gigantic entorhinal cortex neurons.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb48000193b6n60s2h3i0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It was an incredible finding, because their entorhinal neurons were even larger than those in individuals who are much younger, some even in their 30s. That told us there is a structural integrity component at play — like the architecture, the bones, the skeleton of the neuron itself is sturdier.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480001a3b6npz5sjyzv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            We’re expanding the studies of these neurons to understand their biochemical signatures, determine what makes them special, and see if these signatures are found in other types of neurons in the brain of SuperAgers. Are these same neurons particularly vulnerable in those with Alzheimer’s disease, and if so, how and why?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480001b3b6nfkrwktgp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What have you learned from your research about how the brain of a SuperAger reacts to injury, disease and stress?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480001c3b6npbpko3mn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Gefen:&lt;/strong&gt; We’re looking at the inflammatory system in the brain of SuperAgers, with the goal of understanding how the immune cells in their brain respond to disease and adapt to stress. Inflammation, once it crosses a certain threshold, is a major component of cell loss in Alzheimer’s disease and nearly all other neurodegenerative diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480001d3b6nhwsg7k20@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Compared with the brain of same-age peers, SuperAgers have fewer activated microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, in their white matter. White matter is the brain’s super highway, transporting information from one part of the brain to another.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480001e3b6np130em0k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s how it works: Microglia are activated because there is some kind of antigen or disease, typically something destructive in the brain. In some cases, however, microglia and other immune cells become hyperactive and go into overdrive, thus causing inflammation and possible damage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480001f3b6nq6k6dvvv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The brain of a SuperAger, however, has fewer activated microglia. In fact, the levels of microglia&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;were on par with people in their 30s, 40s and 50s. That could mean there is less junk or disease in the brain of a SuperAger so the microglia have no need to be active. Or it could mean microglia are responding efficiently to in clearing out disease or toxins, and because they are more plastic and adaptable, the microglia are able to activate, respond and then calm down.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480001h3b6ncy0f936m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All of this is fascinating —  it may be that at the cellular level, the immune system of a SuperAger brain could be stronger or more adaptive, much like the layers of cells we found in the entorhinal cortex.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480001i3b6nn8f8ghci@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Whether or not you were born with the right genes to protect your brain sounds like the luck of the draw. What does that mean for the future?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vbr9n001p3b6nk9lpu5y5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Gefen: &lt;/strong&gt;Genetics are tricky. It’s not just whether you have a gene or not, it about how your internal and external environment works together to influence how a gene is “turned on,” or expressed — some may be more highly expressed, some will have lower expression. This is the epigenetic part of the puzzle.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480001k3b6nji89ndop@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is a list of candidate genes that we are starting to study very carefully, these are genes that also have a role in aspects of longevity, senescence, cell repair and cognitive reserve to name a few.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480001l3b6no1wnwt2s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I’m excited about that, not only for the genetics that are heritable from parents, but also genetics at the cell level, that enable each neuron or immune cell to carry out its respective job within the brain.  With the technology that’s advancing so rapidly, I’m certain we’re going to get to a point where prevention or modification at the genetic level will be part of the playbook.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480001m3b6nkwax497k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Clearly, there is not a one target resolution for Alzheimer’s disease. I know we all want that one easy fix but it’s just simply not going to happen.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0vb480001n3b6nt0s6u5oa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s going to take many teams and many specialists to come together and create a kind of personalized cocktail for prevention or treatment. I think it’s possible, but it’s going to take time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

It’s produced primarily in the evening. But melatonin isn’t going to quickly send you off to sleep like a fast-acting sleeping pill. Instead, it promotes sleepiness by signaling to your body that it’s nighttime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DEP7S23IINHHNPMFQMDMMD7QVE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For that reason, melatonin supplements are most helpful for people with sleep timing problems, said Phyllis C. Zee, the medical director of the Center for Circadian and Sleep Medicine at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. That includes people with jet lag, shift workers who work late at night or early in the morning, and people who routinely struggle to fall asleep until it’s extremely late at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EZVVEH3CI5FE3N6YKGUB2AUI4E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For those people, taking a melatonin supplement in the evening can set their biological clocks earlier, helping them fall asleep and wake up earlier, Zee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BDJNMJ65LFD67BSYADGSTK4SEE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Melatonin supplements may also benefit older adults, because melatonin levels naturally decline with age, as well as postmenopausal women, said Fariha Abbasi-Feinberg, a sleep medicine specialist and spokeswoman for the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. “I think some people are more sensitive to it and can get some improvements in their sleep from it,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PFN3OM4T6NELHEPECSKNJG7NUE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Many studies have examined whether melatonin can alleviate&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;insomnia, and the data is mostly mixed, Abbasi-Feinberg said. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273450/" target="_blank"&gt;Some studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that it can help people fall asleep faster and sleep more soundly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="G3WL72KPS5ARPFUHW4XKUQHSXA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the American Academy of Sleep Medicine &lt;a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/melatonin-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank"&gt;says that&lt;/a&gt; there “isn’t enough strong evidence on the effectiveness or safety of melatonin supplementation for chronic insomnia” to recommend its use. If you find that you’re  having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep at least three times a week for three months or longer — the criteria for chronic insomnia — then you should visit a doctor or a sleep specialist, Zee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ACPRGLSPKFCMXPGKZ4RT3XJT2Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you are going to try melatonin for an occasional sleep timing problem, it’s best that you use a low dose, around half a milligram to three milligrams, said Zee at Northwestern. You also have to get the timing right: Melatonin should be taken about two hours before bedtime for it to be most effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YSVXKGSAZ5BJTGCBB5UFKRG6CE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/06/25/melatonin-children-sleep-fda-study/" target="_blank"&gt;Some studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that several melatonin products are &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/04/25/melatonin-gummies-dose-safety/" target="_blank"&gt;“inaccurately labeled,”&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27855744/" target="_blank"&gt;several containing&lt;/a&gt; more melatonin than advertised.

These side effects typically occur with doses above 350 milligrams. “It’s important to note that more is not better,” said Zee at Northwestern. “Check with your doctor and let them know that you’re taking magnesium and the dose to avoid possible interactions with other medications or medical conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TUDCANEELVAYFIKJAVRUI32LCA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A healthy gut may promote healthy sleep. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6779243/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies have found&lt;/a&gt; that higher levels of gut microbiome diversity — generally considered a sign of a healthy gut — are associated with longer, better sleep and fewer nighttime awakenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GAGKH7I3I5HXXN3JGZKEXLTZJQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Many hormones and metabolites that are produced by our gut microbes act directly on the brain to influence sleep regulation, including neurotransmitters like serotonin, said Chris Damman, a gastroenterologist at the Digestive Health Center at the University of Washington Medical Center and the author of &lt;a href="https://gutbites.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Gut Bites MD&lt;/a&gt;, a blog on gut health and nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4VLX6SSZGZCJ3NUEYMPOIGGNAI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That’s one reason Abbasi-Feinberg encourages her patients to consume probiotics, which are live bacteria and other microorganisms that confer health benefits. But probiotic supplements — which are available in capsules, gummies, powders and pills&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;—&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;can have some downsides. For one, they tend to contain concentrated doses of just a few strains of bacteria. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/03/28/probiotics-supplements-gut-health-microbiome/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; that taking them may actually reduce the microbial diversity in your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PS25EFQFUBE4JIQGQXFNE4ARCM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Instead, Abbasi-Feinberg recommends that you get probiotics from fermented foods, like plain yogurt, kefir, kimchi, sauerkraut and tempeh. These fermented foods typically contain not only probiotics (the live microbes) but also prebiotics (the fiber the microbes eat) and postbiotics (the vitamins and nutrients they produce).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DVCURU7VPVHM7NUMXSZPPIUTAM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/1602898" target="_blank"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;involving 29 people found that older adults who drank a little more than a half cup of fermented milk every day for three weeks fell asleep more quickly at night and had fewer nighttime awakenings compared to when they drank a placebo. Several studies have shown that fermented foods also have other health benefits, including &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/07/04/probiotics-prebiotics-postbiotics-microbiome/" target="_blank"&gt;reducing inflammation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ISA62BORHFDOLJ6WA7QL7U5DC4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Abbasi-Feinberg said she tells patients to add fermented foods to their diets because they have the potential to improve their sleep and have very little downside. “If there’s no risk involved and the benefit is there, then they’re worth a try,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3EVRDXZNNFBKNOBKD7O3YUIDHU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s well known that vitamin D is essential for building strong bones. But it’s also necessary for good sleep. Vitamin D helps the body convert tryptophan into serotonin, a neurotransmitter that plays an important role in how well and how long you sleep. As &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11082867/" target="_blank"&gt;one recent study&lt;/a&gt; noted, vitamin D receptors have been found in regions of the brain that regulate sleep, suggesting that it plays a direct role in our nightly shut-eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZFMFEQ54MZBZVHCLGIOXQAE5YM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Vitamin D deficiencies can cause issues with low energy and low mood,” said Abbasi-Feinberg, “and sleep can be affected as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3FEOH4WGTRCCPL4YN3KDYJ2XV4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There’s &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28475473/" target="_blank"&gt;some evidence&lt;/a&gt; that taking vitamin D can improve sleep. But the data are mixed, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590142721000094" target="_blank"&gt;not every study&lt;/a&gt; has shown benefits. Also, some of the studies involved taking a single large dose as a shot at weekly or biweekly intervals, rather than a daily pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="L5NVKIEFJNEAJKHPWPCGS33XZA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Abbasi-Feinberg said she sometimes encounters patients with sleep problems who work from home and rarely get any exposure to morning sunshine. “They roll out of bed and turn their computer on and, boom, they’re at work and they don’t get outside,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZR3FRL3QHBHR3LBCUHBQO3LMGQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That can be a problem because exposure to sunshine helps your body produce vitamin D. It also halts production of melatonin and resets your circadian rhythm, which can help you sleep better at night. For that reason, Abbasi-Feinberg often prescribes morning sunshine to her patients — rather than a vitamin D supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VMSNTDTULFBBXG54UT2YO7JRTA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The best way to get vitamin D is to go out into the sunshine,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="list-header-SVSSSC6PQJEWHAD4W3OA64I4H4-42" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;h2 id="SVSSSC6PQJEWHAD4W3OA64I4H4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="SVSSSC6PQJEWHAD4W3OA64I4H4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;5.

Nowadays, it’s commonly recommended as a sleep aid. There’s &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/03/04/should-i-take-ashwagandha-benefits-risks/" target="_blank"&gt;some evidence&lt;/a&gt; that it can help with insomnia.

In a &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0257843" target="_blank"&gt;meta-analysis published in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, scientists analyzed five randomized trials involving 400 people that looked at the effects of ashwagandha on sleep compared to placebo. They found a “small but significant effect” of ashwagandha on overall sleep. People who were assigned to take an ashwagandha supplement daily slept on average about 25 minutes longer each night and had greater improvements in sleep quality compared to people who were given placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N2UDOF6BI5BBVES7PJBMVY6WAE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the scientists also cautioned that there was limited data on ashwagandha’s potentially serious side effects, and they said that more research was needed to determine whether it was safe for long-term use. (It has been linked to a handful of cases of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK548536/" target="_blank"&gt;liver toxicity&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UMG6LVAE3ZHHDDMHCKJGQITQ4U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Abassi-Feinberg said she doesn’t necessarily discourage people from trying ashwagandha or other Ayurvedic remedies to help them sleep if they’re not known to be harmful. But she feels that there’s not enough strong evidence to recommend them. “I’m not enthusiastic about them because I feel like the data just aren’t there yet,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OQW3RIPEAZGEBEEEXDFS66UFOM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Experts &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/03/04/should-i-take-ashwagandha-benefits-risks/" target="_blank"&gt;also recommend&lt;/a&gt; that some people avoid ashwagandha altogether for safety reasons, such as women who are pregnant or nursing, people with an autoimmune,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;liver, or thyroid disorder, and people who are taking sedative medications such as gabapentin or benzodiazepines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HGTIXJI4XFFF3IDH6X7B6VHUW4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have a question about healthy eating?

&lt;p&gt;If anyone needed a reminder that US health secretary and fervent anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has no background in science or medicine, look no further than &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1952851097019633766"&gt;the video he posted on social media&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the two-and-a-half-minute clip, Kennedy announced that he is cancelling nearly $500 million in funding for the development of mRNA-based vaccines against diseases that pose pandemic threats. The funding will be clawed back from 22 now-defunct contracts awarded through the federal agency tasked with developing medical countermeasures to public health threats. The agency is the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy is generally opposed to vaccines, but he is particularly hostile to mRNA-based vaccines. Since the remarkably successful debut of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic—which were developed and mass-produced with unprecedented speed—Kennedy has continually disparaged and spread misinformation about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the video on Tuesday, Kennedy continued that trend, erroneously saying that, "as the pandemic showed us, mRNA vaccines don't perform well against viruses that infect the upper respiratory tract." In reality, COVID-19 vaccines are estimated to have saved &lt;a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/two-years-covid-vaccines-prevented-millions-deaths-hospitalizations"&gt;more than 3 million lives&lt;/a&gt; in the US in just the first two years of the pandemic and additionally prevented more than 18 million hospitalizations in the US in that time. Nearly all &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-vaccine-doses-by-manufacturer?country=~USA"&gt;COVID-19 vaccines used in the US&lt;/a&gt; are mRNA-based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Kennedy's video only went more off the rails from there. He continued on with this nonsensical explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the problem: mRNA only codes for a small part of viral proteins usually a single antigen. One mutation, and the vaccine becomes ineffective. This dynamic drives a phenomenon called antigenic shift meaning that the vaccine paradoxically encourages new mutations and can actually prolong pandemics as the virus constantly mutates to escape the protective effects of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fact-check&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To unpack this nonsense, let's start with how mRNA-based vaccines work. These vaccines deliver a snippet of genetic code—in the form of messenger RNA (mRNA)—to cells. Our cells then translate that mRNA code into a protein that the immune system can, essentially, use for target practice, producing antibodies and cell-based responses against it. After that, if the immune system ever encounters that snippet on an actual invading virus or other germ, it will then recognize it and mount a protective response. Such snippets of germs or other harmful things that can prompt an immune response are generally called antigens.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;After gaining Hollywood recognition in 2021, GLP-1 drugs remain as popular as ever. &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/ozempic-no-sex-drive/" target="_blank"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;, the queen bee of these weight-loss medications, is only approved to treat type 2 diabetes. However, that hasn’t stopped celebrities and the average patient from using the drug off-label as an appetite suppressant. But with those figure-slimming perks come a score of potentially dangerous side effects, one of which has doctors very concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/weight-loss-drugs-pancreatitis/"&gt;Ozempic and Mounjaro Patients Report Potentially Fatal New Side Effect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Doctors are worried about Ozempic-related muscle loss.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without proper dietary guidelines in place, taking GLP-1 drugs can be a slippery slope, many doctors have warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="htlad-mob-square-fixed first_ad karma_unit inline hide-desktop"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s this constant struggle between eating protein and making sure you’re meeting your nutritional requirements, and then taking this drug that doesn’t allow you to eat,” explained anesthesiologist &lt;strong&gt;Nicole Martin&lt;/strong&gt;, MD, on her &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3GoE53zOvM&amp;amp;list=PLiGFuLdrTqlSz0iV5_NM41-0KwplHfLz-&amp;amp;index=8" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Scrubs to Stilettos&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This merry-go-round can cause patients to become “nutritionally deficient” and “&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/ozempic-skinny-fat/"&gt;skinny fat&lt;/a&gt;,” a term used to describe someone with a low BMI (body mass index) but lack of muscle density.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you restrict your calories, and you don’t eat well, and you don’t exercise, now you’re losing lean muscle mass,” further explained &lt;strong&gt;Tiffany Moon&lt;/strong&gt;, MD, doctor and &lt;i&gt;Scrubs to Stilettos&lt;/i&gt; podcast co-host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;i&gt;Best Life&lt;/i&gt; previously reported, “Strong muscles contribute to osteoporosis prevention, joint protection, bone growth, and better balance. A 2024 study published in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/i&gt; found that taking GLP-1 drugs led to &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/weight-loss-drugs-bone-loss/"&gt;decreased muscle mass&lt;/a&gt; and increased bone mineral density (BMD).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This alarming side effect was also flagged in a recent study conducted by nutrition experts from the University of Utah College of Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/ozempic-hair-loss/" target="_blank"&gt;Ozempic Patients Report Another Troubling Side Effect: “I’ve Lost at Least Half My Hair.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GLP-1 drugs can cause a 10% reduction in lean muscle mass.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic can decrease lean muscle mass by roughly 10 percent, according to a new study published in the journal &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://gophysiotherapy.co.uk/lean-muscle-mass-important/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decline in lean body mass—defined as “body weight that isn’t fat”—can disrupt your energy levels, skeletal muscles, and bone strength, “potentially compromising physical functions and quality of life, particularly in those susceptible to sarcopenia,” warned the authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a preclinical mouse model, researchers observed negative changes in lean mass and muscle exertion. Notably, about 45 percent of weight loss was attributed to a reduction in lean mass. Skeletal muscle also shrank by six percent, and “they found that, for some muscles, strength decreased as the mice lost weight,” per the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1092776" target="_blank"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors cautioned against “drawing a one-to-one parallel with humans,” noting that both weight gain and loss have varying effects on mice and humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, these results do corroborate previous theories about Ozempic’s adverse effect on lean muscle mass. In fact, their research ties back to a 2023 AARP report that revealed “for every pound you lose, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/anti-obesity-medications-risks/" target="_blank" data-citation="true"&gt;about 25 percent&lt;/a&gt; is muscle and bone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ozempic is also known to cause bone loss.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bone frailty and weaker muscles are a natural sign of aging; however, certain medications, such as Ozempic, can &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/avoid-ozempic-over-65/"&gt;expedite these changes&lt;/a&gt; in adults 65 and up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Significant weight loss, especially over a short time, can also contribute to a decrease in bone density, which may put older adults at increased risk of bone fractures or exacerbate pre-existing conditions such as osteoporosis,” &lt;strong&gt;HaVy Ngo-Hamilton&lt;/strong&gt;, PharmD, a pharmacist and clinical consultant at &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.buzzrx.com/blog/authors/havy-ngo-pharmd" target="_blank"&gt;BuzzRx&lt;/a&gt;, previously explained to &lt;em&gt;Best Life&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it can make this age group more susceptible to “health complications, disability, and mobility issues,” she added. Consequently, many health officials don’t encourage Ozempic treatment in geriatrics.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is one of the cruelest conditions a person can develop. And even with recent advances, there’s only so much that can be done once its symptoms emerge. Research out this week might highlight a critical and previously missed factor driving the disease, one that could even lead to new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at Harvard Medical School led the study, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09335-x"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in Nature. By studying human brain samples and mice, they found evidence that our brains naturally contain the element lithium—and that its deficiency can help explain the damage caused by Alzheimer’s. The findings are well supported and may have uncovered an important aspect of the neurological disorder, an outside expert told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study researchers “have performed detailed and well-designed studies to investigate how low lithium levels are associated with [Alzheimer’s disease] at the diagnostic, protein, cellular and gene levels,” said Timothy Chang, a neurologist at the University of California, Los Angeles who was not involved with the study. Chang is also director of the California Alzheimer’s Disease Center at UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The brains of people with Alzheimer’s are different in many ways from others. In particular, they contain high levels of misfolded amyloid beta and tau, two proteins that normally have important functions. But these aren’t the only changes seen in Alzheimer’s. And it was while investigating these other changes that the Harvard researchers made their discovery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the help of existing projects that collected postmortem tissue samples, they compared levels of around 30 metals in the brains of people who died along varying stages of cognitive health. The only major difference they found was with lithium. People with cognitively healthy brains had relatively high levels of lithium, whereas those with Alzheimer’s had much lower levels. Importantly, this loss of lithium was apparent even in people who only experienced mild memory problems before dying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers also studied healthy mice and genetically modified mice that develop a version of Alzheimer’s disease. When they depleted lithium from these mice, it appeared to accelerate the buildup of unhealthy amyloid beta and tau in the brain, along with memory decline. They also found evidence that this loss is caused by amyloid beta plaques binding to the brain’s lithium and that this loss of lithium seems to negatively affect all of the brain’s major cell types.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Though there has been some limited research &lt;a href="https://journalbipolardisorders.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40345-024-00348-5"&gt;suggesting&lt;/a&gt; a possible connection between lithium and Alzheimer’s, the authors say theirs is the first to show that our brains naturally carry it. What’s more, their findings hint that lithium is essential to good brain health and that its absence is key to the development of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is the first study to suggest that lithium deficiency might contribute to Alzheimer’s disease. The reason this has not been proposed is because it was not believed that lithium is a natural substance in the brain with biological effect, just a drug with pharmacological effects at high doses,” senior author Bruce Yankner, professor of genetics and neurology in Harvard Medical School’s Blavatnik Institute, told Gizmodo. “As such, this study is the first to explore the consequences of lithium deficiency in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The implications of this study, while still early, could certainly be dramatic. Yankner and his team were also able to identify a lithium-based compound that wasn’t so easily bound by amyloid beta. And when they gave mice (older healthy mice and mice with Alzheimer’s) this compound, it appeared to prevent the damaging brain changes and memory loss normally inevitable with the neurodegenerative condition. Even the best amyloid-based &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/fda-approval-for-leqembi-drug-alzheimers-treatment-1850615742"&gt;treatments&lt;/a&gt; for Alzheimer’s available today, by contrast, only modestly delay its progression.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other forms of lithium are used in medicine to treat certain mental health disorders, particularly depression. But these versions require high dosages to work as intended and come with many side effects as a result. The team’s compound, however, required a much lower dose to be effective in the mice, and no sign of toxicity was observed at all.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Further clinical studies in humans would be necessary to evaluate if the right type and dose of lithium can prevent or slow Alzheimer’s disease,” Chang noted.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yankner and his team are now moving ahead with the research needed to show their compound (or something similar) can be safely tested in human clinical trials. But even before then, the team’s discovery could pay off in other ways. It might be possible to screen for Alzheimer’s risk in the future by measuring people’s lithium levels, for example. And there are still many mysteries left to untangle about lithium and its role in brain health.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“As a neuroscientist, I am excited about exploring the physiology of lithium in the brain,” Yankner said. “I suspect we have just scratched the surface of what will be some very interesting biology.”&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

            The wildfires that ravaged Los Angeles earlier this year — burning entire neighborhoods to the ground, straining firefighting resources and forcing tens of thousands of people to flee their homes — may have led to hundreds more deaths than were recorded, a new study suggests.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0neuyl00003b6nmgi6vw43@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While officials reported that the Palisades and Eaton fires directly killed at least &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-wildfires-los-angeles-deaths-75642a4e6cd66a34cbced64c10dd4f3b" target="_blank"&gt;30 people &lt;/a&gt;when they incinerated parts of Los Angeles County, the blazes may be linked to 410 additional deaths from January 5 to February 1, according to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2837351#:~:text=While%20there%20were%20only%2030,were%20attributable%20to%20the%20wildfires." target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday in the The Journal of the American Medical Association. That would make for a total of 440 wildfire-related deaths, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0opyjn000p3b6ntq4u1uk4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These additional deaths likely reflect a combination of factors, including increased exposure to poor air quality and health care delays and interruptions,” the study says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0potqa00153b6nmrhh9z3a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The wildfires’ impact on his loved ones motivated Andrew Stokes, a mortality demographer and one of the authors of the study, to probe for  excess deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0qbjbd001d3b6nijxjz087@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Having had many family and friends who were directly affected made me feel compelled to look into this further, using my expertise as a demographer and a person who studies mortality statistics,” the Boston University associate professor told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0p1jce000v3b6nwlcucvrs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new findings highlight the need to quantify just how deadly wildfires and other climate-related emergencies can be beyond direct fatalities. The emergencies can have long-term health effects that extend well beyond the disaster itself, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0qi4w2001k3b6nkciuld07@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Years ago, Stokes evaluated the excess deaths during the pandemic after many deaths went uncounted, he said. After developing models to understand the true toll of the virus, Stokes used that expertise to look at the true mortality burden of natural disasters such as the Los Angeles wildfires.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0nphbe00073b6nk9sk6ot9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Along with deaths directly related to the wildfire, the researchers counted deaths partially and indirectly attributed to the wildfires. That includes lung or heart conditions exacerbated by smoke or stress, disruptions to health systems and mental health impacts, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0o0kh4000a3b6n27lesffe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To conduct the study, the researchers compared recorded deaths in Los Angeles County from January to February with figures from previous years, excluding 2020 to 2023 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. That helped researchers estimate how many deaths would have been expected in that time period had no wildfires occurred, Stokes said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0qldfb001q3b6n3ny2biap@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They then calculated excess deaths as the difference between observed and expected deaths, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0ok2i8000g3b6nipk4blcq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In Los Angeles County, weekly deaths consistently exceeded expected deaths during the period from January 5 to February 1, 2025,” the study says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0oc1ub000d3b6nvqr511gj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A total of 6,371 deaths were observed in the county, compared with 5,931 expected deaths, according to the study. This means that nearly 7% of the recorded deaths in Los Angeles County were excess deaths linked to the wildfires.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0qiqg0001o3b6njg3yscn9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Stokes said he was “really surprised and alarmed” at the findings. “The magnitude of the underreporting in the official data is just very severe,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0qncns001w3b6nnwxxqpzn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But he hopes that quantifying the excess deaths can spur authorities to provide more assistance to those still grappling with the devastation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0p77vq000z3b6nngwt1n31@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers note that the data is preliminary and the toll could grow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0qqbt900223b6nkuob69mp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That 440 value that we estimate is clearly the lower bound, because we only look at the first weeks after the wildfire started,” Stokes said. “These medium and long- term effects … could manifest over time as people develop wildfire related diseases.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0ps4z600173b6n7vrewn07@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Future studies should investigate the longer-term health impacts of the wildfires and the specific causes of excess wildfire deaths, the researchers said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In a major new finding almost a decade in the making, researchers at Harvard Medical School&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;say they’ve found a key that may unlock many of the mysteries of Alzheimer’s disease and brain aging — the humble metal lithium.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk700042e6d9nbs3ezv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lithium is best known to medicine as a mood stabilizer given to people who have bipolar disorder and depression. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1970, but it was used by doctors to treat mood disorders for nearly a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3712976/" target="_blank"&gt;century beforehand&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk700072e6d3ciy5a48@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, for the first time, researchers have shown that lithium is naturally present in the body in tiny amounts and that cells require it to function normally — much like vitamin C or iron. It also appears to play a critical role in maintaining brain health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk700092e6dqorrd12k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a series of experiments reported Wednesday in the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#Ack1" target="_blank"&gt;journal Nature&lt;/a&gt;, researchers at Harvard and Rush universities found that depleting lithium in the diet of normal mice caused their brains to develop inflammation and changes associated with accelerated aging.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000a2e6dr41esi18@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In mice that were specially bred to develop the same kinds of brain changes as humans with Alzheimer’s disease, a low-lithium diet revved the buildup of sticky proteins that form plaques and tangles in the brains that are hallmarks of the disease. It also sped up memory loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000b2e6duy5bw3rj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Maintaining normal lithium levels in mice as they aged, however, protected them from brain changes associated with Alzheimer’s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0pqn82000c3b6n2q1tyubz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If further research supports the findings, it could open the door to new treatments and diagnostic tests for Alzheimer’s, which affects an estimated 6.7 million older adults in the United States, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alzheimers-dementia/about/index.html#:~:text=A%20growing%20problem,getting%20lost%20in%20familiar%20areas." target="_blank"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000c2e6dmf1gei3r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The research provides a unifying theory that helps explain so many of the puzzle pieces scientists have been trying to fit together for decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000d2e6dqvo9k9tb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is a potential candidate for a common mechanism leading to the multisystem degeneration of the brain that precedes dementia,” said Dr. Bruce Yankner, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School, who led the study. “It will take a lot more science to determine whether this is a common pathway… or one of several pathways,” to Alzheimer’s, he added. “The data are very intriguing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000e2e6drk22gs88@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In an editorial published in Nature, Dr. Ashley Bush, a neuroscientist who directs the Melbourne Dementia Research Center at the University of Melbourne in Australia, said the researchers “present compelling evidence that lithium does in fact have a physiological role and that normal aging might impair the regulation of lithium levels in the brain.” He was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000f2e6dnf557bld@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Close examination of human and animal brain tissues, along with genetic investigations in the study, found the mechanism that appears to be at play: Beta amyloid plaques — the sticky deposits that gum up the brains of Alzheimer’s patients — bind to lithium and hold it, including the type that’s normally present in the body, as well as the commonly prescribed form. This binding depletes lithium available for nearby cells, including important scavengers known as microglia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000g2e6dmb1i7t9t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the brain is healthy and functioning normally, microglia are waste managers, clearing away beta amyloid before it can accumulate and can cause harm.  In the team’s experiments, microglia from the brains of lithium-deficient mice showed a reduced ability to sweep away and break down beta amyloid.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000h2e6dxorelmou@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yankner believes this creates a downward spiral. The accumulation of beta amyloid soaks up more and more lithium, further crippling the brain’s ability to clear it away.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000i2e6de4jl714f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He and his colleagues tested different lithium compounds and found one — lithium orotate — that doesn’t bind to amyloid beta.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000j2e6dya77ckhf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When they gave lithium orotate to mice with signs of Alzheimer’s in their brains, these changes reversed: Beta amyloid plaques and tangles of tau that were choking the memory centers of the brain were reduced.  Mice treated with lithium were once again able to navigate mazes and learn to identify new objects, whereas those who got placebos showed no change in their memory and thinking deficits.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0pfoh500033b6n9wf3kjrr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In its natural form, lithium is an element, a soft, silvery-white metal that readily combines with other elements to form compounds and salts. It’s naturally present in the environment, including in food and water.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0pq0uw00073b6nqfqlcqc5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists have never fully known how it works to improve mood — only that it does. The original formula for 7Up soda included lithium — it was called 7Up Lithiated Lemon Soda — and &lt;a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geology/lithium.htm" target="_blank"&gt;touted&lt;/a&gt; as a hangover cure and mood lifter “for hospital or home use.” Some hot springs known to contain mineral water brimming with lithium became sought out &lt;a href="https://ashland.news/viewpoint-the-virtues-of-ashlands-lithia-water/" target="_blank"&gt;wellness destinations&lt;/a&gt; for their curative powers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000k2e6drwqnc6r5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, people who take prescription doses of lithium — which were much higher than the doses used in the new study — can sometimes develop thyroid or kidney toxicity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0rj6tb00022e6dslccooq8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Tests of the mice given low doses of lithium orotate showed no signs of damage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000l2e6d42997iem@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s encouraging, Yankner said, but it doesn’t mean people should try to take lithium supplements on their own.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000m2e6dxf3k1ntl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A mouse is not a human. Nobody should take anything based just on mouse studies,” Yankner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000n2e6d4kgn5nr0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The lithium treatment data we have is in mice, and it needs to be replicated in humans. We need to find the right dose in humans,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000o2e6dil2gmghu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The normal amounts of lithium in our bodies, and the concentrations given to the mice, are small — about 1,000 times lower than doses given to treat bipolar disorder, Yankner notes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000p2e6dw1alkjx0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yankner said he hoped toxicity trials of lithium salts would start soon.  Neither he nor any of his co-authors have a financial interest in the outcome of the research, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000q2e6d2a7gwazq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The National Institutes of Health was the major funder of the study, along with grants from private foundations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000r2e6dk5mdboxt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “NIH support was absolutely critical for this work,” Yankner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000s2e6d5dbyhdzd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new research corroborates earlier studies hinting that lithium might be important for Alzheimer’s. A large Danish study &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28832877/" target="_blank"&gt;published in 2017&lt;/a&gt; found people with higher levels of lithium in their drinking water were less likely to be diagnosed with dementia compared with those whose tap water contained naturally lower lithium levels. Another &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8929585/#:~:text=We%20found%20that%20lithium%20was,with%20either%20AD%20or%20VD." target="_blank"&gt;large study&lt;/a&gt; published in 2022 from the United Kingdom found that people prescribed lithium were about half as likely has those in a control group to be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, suggesting a protective effect of the drug.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000t2e6ddw3xyw1r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But lithium’s use in psychiatry caused it to become type cast as therapeutic, Yankner said.  No one realized it might be important to the body’s normal physiology.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000u2e6d6wnffvp6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That happened in part because the amounts of lithium that typically circulate in the body are so small, they couldn’t be quantified until recently. Yankner and his team had to adapt new technology to measure it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000v2e6doq3wa1ns@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the first stage of the research, the scientists tested the brain tissue and blood of older patients collected by the brain bank at Rush University for trace levels of 27 metals.  Some of the patients had no history of memory trouble, while others had early memory decline and pronounced Alzheimer’s.  While there was no change in the levels of most metals they measured, lithium was an exception.  Lithium levels were consistently lower in patients with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s compared to those with normal brain function.  The brains of patients Alzheimer’s disease also showed increased levels of zinc and decreased levels of copper, something scientists had observed before.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000w2e6d66gj0hwf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Consistently finding lower lithium levels in the brains of people with memory loss amounted to a smoking gun, Yankner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000x2e6dwumleo05@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At first, frankly, we were skeptical of the result because it wasn’t expected,” said Yankner.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000y2e6dni9fbw4c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But it held up even when they checked samples from other brain banks at Massachusetts General Hospital, Duke and Washington universities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000z2e6dsb5lfpap@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We wanted to know whether this drop in lithium was biologically meaningful, so we devised an experimental protocol where we could take lithium selectively out of the diet of mice and see what happens,” Yankner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk700102e6di9q310pn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When they fed the mice a low-lithium diet, simply dropping their natural levels by 50%, their brains rapidly developed features of Alzheimer’s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk700112e6dqw5g1321@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The neurons started to degenerate. The immune cells in the brain went wild in terms of increased inflammation and worse maintenance function of the neurons around them, and it looked more like an advanced Alzheimer patient,” Yankner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk700122e6drn0o0irw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The team also found the gene expression profiles of lithium-deficient mice and people who had Alzheimer’s disease looked very similar.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk700132e6d7po1ibpw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers then started to look at how this drop in lithium might occur. Yankner said in the earliest stages there’s a decrease in the uptake of lithium in the brain from the blood. They don’t yet know exactly how or why it happens, but it’s likely to be from a variety of things including reduced dietary intake, as well as genetic and environmental factors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk700142e6dqvmyrtep@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The major source of lithium for most people is their diet. Some of the foods that have the most lithium are leafy green vegetables, nuts, legumes and some spices like turmeric and cumin. Some mineral waters are also rich sources.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk700152e6d5a9tixep@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In other words, Yankner said, a lot of the foods that have already proven to be healthy and reduce a person’s risk of dementia may be beneficial because of their lithium content.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk700162e6d4g3bjap0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You know, oftentimes one finds in science that things may have an effect, and you think you know exactly why, but then subsequently turn out to be completely wrong about why,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how should we approach protein with an eye toward longevity? Bhanote and Sehgal are of the same mind about this: Eat more protein-rich plants and fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While fish certainly isn’t a plant, it is thought of differently than animal-based proteins because it has a completely different nutritional makeup than meat, and scientific research has repeatedly shown benefits to human health when consumed regularly. Eating fish regularly has been associated with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25969396/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7918805" data-affiliate="true"&gt;reducing the risk of premature death by 12%.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sehgal explained that plant-based proteins (such as beans, lentils, chickpeas, soy, nuts and seeds) are loaded with antioxidants, fiber and nutrients that keep our hearts healthy, reduce inflammation and lower the risk of chronic diseases. “These foods are naturally low in AGEs and do not contribute to TMAO production, making them much gentler on your cells and overall health,” Bhanote added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8804093" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7918805" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Scientific studies show&lt;/a&gt; that having a diet that prioritizes plant-based proteins lowers the risk of mortality associated with cardiovascular disease and other causes. In other words, replacing animal proteins with plant proteins can add years to your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most Americans meet or exceed the protein recommendation for meat, poultry and eggs, 90% of Americans &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7918805" data-affiliate="true"&gt;aren’t meeting the recommended guidelines for seafood&lt;/a&gt;. Sehgal told HuffPost that seafood high in protein and unsaturated fats supports &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32529206/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7918805" data-affiliate="true"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;, promotes &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8182174/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7918805" data-affiliate="true"&gt;hormone balance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8199776/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7918805" data-affiliate="true"&gt;helps fight inflammation&lt;/a&gt; — all of which contribute to longevity.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, no one is disputing that protein is important. It’s crucial to get enough and, as Ferree pointed out, it’s especially important to get enough as we age. But other nutrients are important too, which is why Sehgal said the best diet for longevity is a balanced one that includes a wide variety of nutrient-rich foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefit of eating a balanced diet full of plants certainly isn’t revolutionary news, but it is backed up by many scientific studies. When it comes to longevity — and health in general — science-backed wins out over trendy and new. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/is-protein-healthy_l_66db5de1e4b01c1d24fc1de6" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7918805"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As doctors explain here, getting too much can backfire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Overemphasizing Protein Isn’t Actually Healthy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/lizmrichardson/toxic-things-about-women-society-normalizes?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:17 Toxic "Lies" Society Normalizes About Women That Are Actually Scams, According To Older Women;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link "&gt;17 Toxic "Lies" Society Normalizes About Women That Are Actually Scams, According To Older Women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Anna Blazhuk / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Whey protein powder in a measuring scoop, protein shake in a glass and strawberry on pink table in sunlight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/maryleavines/marriage-fallopian-tube-removal-infertility-divorce?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I Had My Fallopian Tubes Removed To End My Marriage.

Ferree;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Suzanne J. Ferree&lt;/a&gt;, who is double-board-certified in family medicine and anti-aging and regenerative medicine, told HuffPost that it’s especially important to get enough as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The common theory is that we need to cut protein-rich foods as we age, but the research actually only supports this in younger people, not in those of us over 50,” Ferree said. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8068133" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scientific research backs this up;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Scientific research backs this up&lt;/a&gt;, showing that older adults need more protein than younger adults because our bodies naturally lose muscle as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So yes, protein is absolutely important. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-much-protein-to-eat_l_63a22684e4b0aeb2ace83986" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:How much protein a person needs each day;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;How much protein a person needs each day&lt;/a&gt; varies based on one’s individual health and needs, but the Food and Drug Administration recommends aiming for 50 grams of protein a day as part of a 2,000-calorie diet. The problem is that many people are eating more protein than they need. On top of that, Americans are overconsuming a specific type of protein that isn’t all that healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In general, there are two types of proteins: animal-based proteins and plant-based proteins. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10222455" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research has shown;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Research has shown&lt;/a&gt; that plant-based proteins are healthier than animal-based proteins. Unfortunately, Americans are consuming more of the latter than the former.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“A common mistake is the overemphasis on consuming a high-protein diet, particularly one rich in animal-based proteins, with the belief that it is essential for longevity and muscle preservation. Many people assume that the more protein they consume, the healthier they will be, leading to an overconsumption of animal products like meat, dairy and eggs,” said &lt;a href="https://www.drbhanote.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Monisha Bhanote;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Monisha Bhanote&lt;/a&gt;, a quintuple-board-certified physician and longevity expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most Americans are eating &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/28/well/eat/how-much-protein-do-we-need.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:about 100 grams;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;about 100 grams&lt;/a&gt; of protein a day, double the recommended amount. &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:According to a Dietary Guidelines for Americans report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;According to a Dietary Guidelines for Americans report&lt;/a&gt;, 75% of Americans meet or exceed the recommendation for meat, poultry and eggs.

She explained that the biggest reasons for this come down to two harmful compounds: advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“AGEs are harmful compounds that form when proteins or fats combine with sugar in the bloodstream,” Bhanote said. She explained that animal-based foods — especially if they are grilled, fried or roasted — are high in AGEs. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6600625/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research shows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that these compounds can accumulate in your tissues and, over time, can lead to oxidative stress and inflammation, which are key drivers of cellular aging. “AGEs damage proteins, DNA and other vital cellular structures, accelerating the aging process and contributing to chronic diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer’s,” Bhanote said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What about TMAO? Bhanote explained that elevated levels of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9235870/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TMAO;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;TMAO&lt;/a&gt; have been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, heart attack and stroke — all of which obviously are not good for longevity. “TMAO promotes the accumulation of cholesterol in the arteries and impairs the body’s ability to remove it, leading to inflammation and further damage to the cardiovascular system. This not only compromises heart health but also affects overall cellular function and longevity,” Bhanote said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related to the mistake many people make of overemphasizing protein in their diet, &lt;a href="https://cbb.yale.edu/people/raghav-sehgal" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Raghav Sehgal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Raghav Sehgal&lt;/a&gt;, a Ph.D. student and Gruber fellow at Yale University whose research focuses on human aging, told HuffPost that one common mistake people make when it comes to longevity is focusing on “miracle diets” promising fast results. The biggie that’s relevant here: the &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/keto-effects-body_l_5d9b58abe4b099389803e441" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ketogenic diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;ketogenic diet&lt;/a&gt;, which prioritizes fat and protein while minimizing carbohydrates. For many people doing keto, meat and eggs are hero foods; however, as previously explained, eating too many animal products can take years off your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Use Protein To Work For You, Not Against You  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Aleksandr Zubkov / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/scarymouse/wholesome-posts-from-this-week-april-4?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:19 Wholesome Posts I Saw This Week That Were So Cute, They Legitimately Put Me In A Happier Mood;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;19 Wholesome Posts I Saw This Week That Were So Cute, They Legitimately Put Me In A Happier Mood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So, how should we approach protein with an eye toward longevity? Bhanote and Sehgal are of the same mind about this: Eat more protein-rich plants and fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While fish certainly isn’t a plant, it is thought of differently than animal-based proteins because it has a completely different nutritional makeup than meat, and scientific research has repeatedly shown benefits to human health when consumed regularly. Eating fish regularly has been associated with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25969396/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reducing the risk of premature death by 12%.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;reducing the risk of premature death by 12%.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sehgal explained that plant-based proteins (such as beans, lentils, chickpeas, soy, nuts and seeds) are loaded with antioxidants, fiber and nutrients that keep our hearts healthy, reduce inflammation and lower the risk of chronic diseases. “These foods are naturally low in AGEs and do not contribute to TMAO production, making them much gentler on your cells and overall health,” Bhanote added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8804093" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scientific studies show;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Scientific studies show&lt;/a&gt; that having a diet that prioritizes plant-based proteins lowers the risk of mortality associated with cardiovascular disease and other causes. In other words, replacing animal proteins with plant proteins can add years to your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While most Americans meet or exceed the protein recommendation for meat, poultry and eggs, 90% of Americans &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:aren’t meeting the recommended guidelines for seafood;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;aren’t meeting the recommended guidelines for seafood&lt;/a&gt;. Sehgal told HuffPost that seafood high in protein and unsaturated fats supports &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32529206/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;, promotes &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8182174/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hormone balance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;hormone balance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8199776/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:helps fight inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;helps fight inflammation&lt;/a&gt; — all of which contribute to longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Again, no one is disputing that protein is important. It’s crucial to get enough and, as Ferree pointed out, it’s especially important to get enough as we age. But other nutrients are important too, which is why Sehgal said the best diet for longevity is a balanced one that includes a wide variety of nutrient-rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The benefit of eating a balanced diet full of plants certainly isn’t revolutionary news, but it is backed up by many scientific studies. When it comes to longevity — and health in general — science-backed wins out over trendy and new. &lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/is-protein-healthy_l_66db5de1e4b01c1d24fc1de6" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HuffPost.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alanavalko/unhinged-microfeminisms?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:&amp;quot;He Thinks This Is Hostile And He Is Correct&amp;quot; — Women Are Sharing The &amp;quot;Unhinged&amp;quot; Ways They Practice Microfeminism That Reaally Grind A Small Man's Gears;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;"He Thinks This Is Hostile And He Is Correct" — Women Are Sharing The "Unhinged" Ways They Practice Microfeminism That Reaally Grind A Small Man's Gears&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexandraschlagel/which-zodiac-sign-is-the-most-datable?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:It's Time To Find Out Which Zodiac Sign Is The Most Datable;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;It's Time To Find Out Which Zodiac Sign Is The Most Datable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/dannicaramirez/ugly-privilege-viral-tik-tok-explained?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:A Woman Went Viral After Saying She Has &amp;quot;Ugly Privilege&amp;quot; — Here's What It Means And What It Says About Society Today;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;A Woman Went Viral After Saying She Has "Ugly Privilege" — Here's What It Means And What It Says About Society Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/emilylaurence/is-protein-healthy-sc?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Read it on BuzzFeed.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Read it on BuzzFeed.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Lifestyle Canada</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 00:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPVHZQODZ3V19KYktLN0E5VU5XNHlIVW5CdjFCTkxWSHA1TjMxaFNPQi1BcktGQVBqUV9hRDR2Qml3V0t5YW1wRlYzX2NaZi02eE5KLXZjS1BEYkF1OHpldVIwUXc1OHFHUzBaX2NzZ2dnT18xN3NDLWRrR2REM0NMcUxB</guid></item><item><title>瘟疫在Evergreen附近杀死猫，自2023年以来首次在Jeffco确诊病例- KDVR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxPT0k0MTZtVENqY0hiQU5rOUpMNDYzdDBXNkNfT3dGZGEtMGcza2tTSTlySTFJTExPSnR6SGJRTFR2SGpaOUVaRlBlZG84WmNDMHRjM3NDU0dWVGRXQkwzTWtqM0VySzNMZlVVUmJrZHYtRENmaFF5dUZ4cDJhUjN6VXd0UEkwUS1VT0RXYl80c2dTRlhoNnkyNXR5akRJd3c5bmlyMEFB0gGrAUFVX3lxTE9XOUtBOUU3dEZIWmNxVTB4NHQzdExDeWtRVTZ6bm9PQ0VFc2t0eFVybnRsUWQ3bmdmN29KZ3RVYXdVdHhFNnpSeEtCZ0Itb0laUlBqR2YzXzVyRFh2eXJHS05hU0tFTHJ2dHQtMXZXb1JHWW9Uekl1VTE2em4zQ2FXTnVUazZnWlZsMGJyWEVpMlg5NVc1UEpHeUxEU2tqR0c3MndENVlFblV0bw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content article-body rich-text "&gt;
		
		


&lt;p&gt;DENVER (&lt;a href="http://kdvr.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;KDVR&lt;/a&gt;) — A domestic cat is dead after it contracted plague, according to Jefferson County Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cat was located in Evergreen near Cub Creek Park, and is being hailed as the first confirmed plague case in Jefferson County since 2023. The agency said the cat did not survive the disease.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“It’s not uncommon to see a few animal cases of plague in the warmer months in Colorado,” said Jim Rada, Jefferson County Environmental Health Director. “Like with this case, sometimes our local veterinarians are the first to see plague when our pets get sick. In many ways, they are a first line of defense both in helping keep our pets safe from fleas that could make our pets sick and in treating them if they are exposed to plague.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="mobile" data-player-id="nrh3mjd6" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is plague? Can you treat plague?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jefferson County Public Health explained that plague is a disease caused by bacteria and is often spread to humans and pets through flea bites or direct contact with infected animals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="nrh3mjd6" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The health department said that human cases of plague are rare and can be life-threatening if not treated. Early, effective treatment includes antibiotics. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of plague in humans may include sudden high fever, chills, headache, nausea and swollen lymph nodes. Symptoms of the disease in pets can include fever, low energy, loss of appetite and swollen lymph nodes.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;To reduce the risk of getting plague, officials recommend that you:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay away from wild animals&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Never touch dead or sick animals&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Keep pets on leashes and away from wildlife&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Do not let pets roam freely outside&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Talk to your vet about flea prevention in pets&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Watch for signs of illness in pets&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Seek medical attention if you feel sick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anyone who is concerned they may have been exposed to plague or has symptoms is asked to contact their healthcare provider immediately. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;If there’s concern that a pet has been exposed or has symptoms, contact a veterinarian as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TACOMA, Wash. — Health officials are investigating what could be the first case of locally acquired malaria ever recorded in Washington state.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman in Pierce County who has not recently traveled was diagnosed with the disease Saturday and is receiving treatment, officials said. Her condition is being monitored.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While malaria infections are typically linked to travel, this case may have originated from within the state. The most likely scenario, officials say, is that a mosquito bit someone infected with a travel-related case of malaria and later transmitted the disease to the Pierce County patient.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This risk of getting infected with malaria in Pierce County remains very low,” said Dr. James Miller, Tacoma-Pierce County health officer. “Malaria is a rare disease overall in the United States — and the vast majority of cases in the United States occur following exposures in countries with ongoing transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, the Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department is working with the Washington State Department of Health to implement mosquito trapping and testing in the area.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington typically reports 20 to 70 malaria cases per year, all tied to travel. Nationally, the U.S. sees about 2,000 to 2,500 cases annually. Between May and October 2023, 10 locally acquired cases were reported in four states — the first such U.S. cases in 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malaria is transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes, which live in parts of the United States. If they bite someone with an active malaria infection, they can pass the parasite to others.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malaria can cause fever, chills, sweats and headaches. Other symptoms that can occur can affect gastrointestinal, respiratory, muscular, and neurological systems.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis of over 36,000 people with high blood pressure has shown that taking more steps, even below the recommended daily target of 10,000 steps, and walking faster, is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of major problems of the heart and blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The study, &lt;a href="https://apps.crossref.org/pendingpub/pendingpub.html?doi=10.1093%2Feurjpc%2Fzwaf441" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;European Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/i&gt;, found that compared to a daily step count of 2,300 steps, every extra 1,000 steps was linked to a 17% reduction in the risk of developing a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), up to 10,000 steps. Additional steps above 10,000 were associated with a lower risk of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 1.28 billion people worldwide are living with high blood pressure, and it places them at increased risk of heart disease (49% increase), stroke (62% increase) and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/heart+failure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt; (77–89% increase). Until now, it has been unclear how much people with high blood pressure need to increase their physical activity in order to see a reduction in their risk of MACE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Emmanuel Stamatakis, Director of the Mackenzie Wearables Research Hub at the University of Sydney, Australia, who supervised the study, said, "This study is one of the first to demonstrate a dose-response relationship between daily step count and major problems of the heart and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+vessels/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood vessels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In a nutshell, we found that, if you live with high blood pressure, the more you walk with greater intensity, the lower your risk for future serious cardiovascular events.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"These findings support the message that any amount of physical activity is beneficial, even below the widely recommended daily target of 10,000 steps."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study analyzed data obtained from 32,192 people who had enrolled in a sub-study of the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt; study. They had been diagnosed with high blood pressure and agreed to wear an accelerometer on their wrist for seven consecutive days to measure how far and how fast they walked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from the accelerometers was collected between 2013 and 2015. The average age was 64 and the participants were followed up for nearly eight years, providing the researchers with data for 283,001 person-years. During this time, 1,935 cases of heart problems or stroke occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to a 17% reduction in overall risk for every extra 1,000 steps a day, the researchers found a 22% reduction in heart failure, 9% reduction in risk of heart attack, and 24% reduction in risk of stroke. This means that every increase of 1,000 steps a day was associated with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an average reduction in the absolute risk of MACE of 31.5 events per 10,000 person-years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an average reduction in the absolute risk of 7.2 heart failure events per 10,000 person-years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an average reduction in the absolute risk of 9.9 myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) per 10,000 person-years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an average reduction in the absolute risk of 10.4 strokes per 10,000 person-years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;The average (mean) intensity of the 30 minutes of fastest walking per day was 80 steps a minute and this was associated with a 30% reduced risk of MACE. There was no evidence of harm in people whose 30 minutes of fastest walking or running was over 130 steps a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found similar results when they looked at 37,350 people without high blood pressure. Every 1,000-step increase in daily step count led to an average lower risk of MACE, heart failure, myocardial infarctions and stroke of 20.2%, 23.2%, 17.9%, and 24.6%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Stamatakis said, "Our findings offer patients accessible and measurable targets for heart health, even below 10,000 steps daily. Clinicians should promote physical activity as standard care, especially in patients with high blood pressure. Our results can inform new, tailored public health recommendations for these patients. Future recommendations on walking in people with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/high+blood+pressure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; could consider promoting higher stepping intensity."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strengths of the study include the large number of patients, the use of accelerometers to provide detailed information on numbers of steps and speed, and the use of data from national records in England, Wales and Scotland on deaths and causes of death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limitations include the fact that physical activity was measured only when people first joined the study and did not include any subsequent changes in behavior. In addition, the researchers point out that their findings can show only that there is an association between walking further and faster and better health outcomes, not that it causes these better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, they conducted extensive analyses to minimize the risk of what is called 'reverse causation' (in which, in this case, health problems could be causing both a reduction in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; and an increase in heart disease events).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most UK Biobank participants are white, are less likely to be obese, to smoke or drink alcohol, and to be better educated, and so they may not be representative of the general UK population.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study that tracked the diets of more than 205,000 adults over decades, French fries were associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D), while other forms of potatoes—including baked, boiled, and mashed—were not. The study, led by Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health also found that swapping any form of potato for whole grains may lower the risk of T2D.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;i&gt;BMJ&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, while previous studies hinted at a link between &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/potatoes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;potatoes&lt;/a&gt; and T2D, the evidence was inconsistent and often lacked detail on cooking methods and the potential effects of substituting other foods for potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study offers deeper, more comprehensive insights by looking at different types of potatoes, tracking diet over decades, and exploring the effects of swapping potatoes for other foods," said lead author Seyed Mohammad Mousavi, postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're shifting the conversation from, 'Are potatoes good or bad?' to a more nuanced—and useful—question: How are they prepared, and what might we eat instead?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined the diets and diabetes outcomes of 205,107 men and women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study, Nurses' Health Study II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than 30 years, participants regularly responded to dietary questionnaires, detailing the frequency with which they consumed certain foods, including French fries; baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes; and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/whole+grains/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also reported on new health diagnoses, including T2D, and various other health, lifestyle, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/demographic+factors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;demographic factors&lt;/a&gt;, which the researchers controlled for. Over the course of the study period, 22,299 participants reported that they developed T2D.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The study found that three servings weekly of French fries increased the risk of developing T2D by 20%. Baked, boiled, and mashed potatoes were not significantly associated with T2D risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers calculated, however, that eating whole grains—such as whole grain pasta, bread, or farro—in place of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes could reduce the risk of T2D by 4%. Replacing French fries with whole grains could bring T2D risk down by 19%. Even swapping refined grains for French fries was estimated to lower T2D risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers complemented their study with a novel meta-analytic approach to estimate how swapping potatoes for whole grains could affect the risk of T2D, using data from previously published &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cohort+studies/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cohort studies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This involved two separate meta-analyses: one based on data from 13 cohorts examining potato intake and the other from 11 cohorts on whole grain intake, each encompassing over 500,000 participants and 43,000 T2D diagnoses across four continents. The results were closely consistent with those of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The public health message here is simple and powerful: small changes in our daily diet can have an important impact on the risk of type 2 diabetes. Limiting potatoes—especially limiting French fries—and choosing healthy, whole-grain sources of carbohydrate could help lower the risk of type 2 diabetes across the population," said corresponding author Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For policymakers, our findings highlight the need to move beyond broad food categories and pay closer attention to how foods are prepared and what they're replacing. Not all carbs—or even all potatoes—are created equal, and that distinction is crucial when it comes to shaping effective dietary guidelines."&lt;/p&gt;

Dunking your spuds in a deep fryer might be a recipe for elevating your risk of Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9ac8c8" class="body-graf"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2024-082121" target="_blank"&gt;study published Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal BMJ, swapping out your weekly dose of frites for boiled, baked or mashed potatoes could lower your risk of this chronic condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b33060" class="body-graf"&gt;The authors examined the diets of more than 205,000 adults in the U.S. who responded to questionnaires about what they ate over nearly four decades. Among those who consumed potatoes, the authors looked at which people developed Type 2 diabetes, a disease that leads to persistently high blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3f12bf" class="body-graf"&gt;Eating three weekly servings of french fries, they found, was associated with a 20% increased risk of Type 2 diabetes. But consuming the same amount of boiled, baked or mashed potatoes did not appear to be linked to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-467012" class="body-graf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/about/about-type-2-diabetes.html" target="_blank"&gt;vast majority&lt;/a&gt; of the 1 in 10 people with diabetes in the U.S. have Type 2. The condition can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes or kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fd5fd2" class="body-graf"&gt;The findings underscore that the way foods are prepared is key to their overall health risks or benefits, said Seyed Mohammad Mousavi, the study’s lead author and a postdoctoral research fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-575681" class="body-graf"&gt;“Not all potatoes are created equal,” he said. “Even a small amount of french fries, less than one serving in the week, is associated with a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cd1aa6" class="body-graf"&gt;Unlike boiled or baked potatoes, french fries are deep-fried in oils that usually contain trans or saturated fats. The way the body metabolizes those fats can contribute to insulin resistance — when cells don’t respond properly to insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar. Regular consumption of fried foods can also lead to obesity and inflammation, both of which raise the risk of Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-796089" class="body-graf"&gt;“When you fry the potatoes, the energy content — calories — increases because of the fat they absorb. If you eat many servings of french fries, it predisposes [people] to weight gain,” said Candida Rebello, the director of the nutrition and chronic disease program at Louisiana State University, who wasn’t involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-32bfdd" class="body-graf"&gt;The study relied on data collected&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;between 1984 and 2021, when several different frying methods were popular. Most fast-food chains today prepare fries using vegetable oils like canola, sunflower, soybean or peanut oil. But during the 1980s, beef tallow was common. And in the early 1990s, restaurants shifted to partially hydrogenated oils. (The oils were a major source of trans fat in the U.S. diet and were &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/final-determination-regarding-partially-hydrogenated-oils-removing-trans-fat" target="_blank"&gt;largely phased out of the food industry&lt;/a&gt; by 2018.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-65f377" class="body-graf"&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/seed-oil-what-know-tiktok-explained-rcna186659" target="_blank"&gt;the seed oils used today &lt;/a&gt;are &lt;a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1848499491151745180?mx=2" target="_blank"&gt;“poisoning” Americans&lt;/a&gt; and contributing to high levels of obesity in children. He has advocated for restaurants to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-first-month-health-secretary-vaccines-food-additives-rcna196042" target="_blank"&gt;switch back to beef tallow&lt;/a&gt;, a recommendation that isn’t backed by scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5a1dcc" class="body-graf"&gt;“Beef tallow is high in saturated fats and other harmful fats. We definitely don’t recommend that,” Mousavi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b178ca" class="body-graf"&gt;One limitation of Mousavi’s study is that it did not account for people adding unhealthy ingredients to their boiled, baked or mashed potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-032502" class="body-graf"&gt;“What do people add to baked potatoes? Butter, bacon, cheese, sour cream,” said Shannon Galyean, an assistant professor of nutritional sciences at Texas Tech University, who wasn’t part of the research. “Then we also don’t know, did they eat it with the skins?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cb1a43" class="body-graf"&gt;Galyean said potato skins contain nutrients such as fiber, which helps with blood sugar control. And potatoes, when they aren’t deep-fried or slathered in butter, can be a useful source of potassium, which helps regulate blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-289a33" class="body-graf"&gt;“Definitely, potatoes can be considered a healthy food when you don’t fry it, or when you don’t add lots of fat to it,” Galyean said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bc4ab0" class="body-graf"&gt;Mousavi said baking french fries at home with a healthier oil, such as olive or avocado oil, could help lower one’s diabetes risk compared to eating them from fast-food restaurants. Swapping out potatoes with whole grains, such as farro or whole-grain bread or pasta, could make an even bigger difference. These foods have a lower glycemic index, meaning they’re less likely to spike blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2ea229" class="body-graf"&gt;His study found that whole grains, when compared to all types of potatoes, were less likely to elevate one’s diabetes risk. White rice, on the other hand, had a stronger association with Type 2 diabetes than either of these foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6312b2" class="body-graf"&gt;Megan Mulcahy, the director of communications at Potatoes USA, a marketing and research organization that supports potato consumption, said fries can “absolutely be part of a healthy eating pattern when enjoyed in moderation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b5bd44" class="body-graf"&gt;Galyean said it’s important to consider a person’s overall diet, which has a greater impact on their health than any individual food. Nutritionists generally recommend a colorful plate with a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and healthy proteins such as fish, beans or nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6e31aa" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“People don’t eat just one thing; they eat meals,” Galyean said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxOYkxLY3lfMU4tYTZoMEJZOUhmdVJpLWxlU1d2WXA0RTdGZ2VacGItU29JTkRESXAyZFlrcmwxeGZLNlUzU0FHa01nUWpvWFpIeFdoUXhvNDhRbVk5VHEycnJxeFZzMFp3QUdGZngwSDQwb2dvQkFmRWNFbDFGU3F1aHVCSjVHLUYzOGFTT0cyeUgzRDBLeGF2NkxTeXVIclYzaU5XNjVvOEd3THc5dmhHOXpB0gFWQVVfeXFMTmtOQzJGTWo4MGJxTVJsLXlaRVJTQndBZUtXMHA2MmN4ZXhDYnNVZ01kWHVuUHJ1eG9YLURqb1hsSXRuVzVucjFwRmZmV0JJbjFBQjBKQ3c</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，经常吃薯片会使患2型糖尿病的风险增加20% --《卫报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxQVnhnZ213UlpubUdmakNMTFo2eXYwNmRKRE5TLWgyNy1SR2tHZzZOQ09KNmZ4cWpuRzdlUUYyWjNDMURCaHJPVTJFZHZwWnhaMU85dU1PSjJSRi1IOHUyNXJqNjdVZVJTdnNudTVoYWlxMW5Hdy1iS1J6UTRKMEF4S3NsWUpJT0dVSGh2ejYyU3VEMF8xMVVaeVJYcTA5T2tQQUdJSU5NOHZEZGtydEFMYk5nanlBNU0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Love potatoes?

They based their findings on food questionnaires filled out by 205,000 health professionals in the US every four years between 1984 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Someone who eats chips three times a week was found to raise their risk of diabetes by 20%, but those who ate potatoes with the same regularity after baking, boiling or mashing them did so by only 5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The high starch content of potatoes, leading to a high glycemic index and load, combined with possible loss of nutrients and possible health risks resulting from various cooking methods, could contribute to adverse health outcomes,” the study explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Replacing potatoes with whole grains lowers the risk of diabetes by 8%, and if grains are eaten instead of chips specifically, that cuts the risk by 19%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Kawther Hashem, a lecturer in public health nutrition at Queen Mary University of London, said: “Potatoes can be part of a healthy diet, but it’s how we prepare them that makes the difference. Boiled, baked or mashed potatoes are naturally low in fat and a source of fibre, vitamin C and potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“But when we deep fry them into chips or french fries, especially in large portions and with added salt, they become less healthy with their high-fat, salt and calorie content that’s much more likely to contribute to weight gain and increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;However, replacing any form of potatoes with white rice is a bad idea as it leads to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, the paper found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Hashem added: “This research reinforces the simple message, which is to enjoy potatoes – just don’t rely on chips as your go-to option. And, where possible, try swapping them out for whole grains like brown rice, bulgur wheat, wholemeal pasta or even sweet potato with skin on, which are healthier and protective for long-term health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers stressed their findings were observational and did not prove a cause and effect relationship between eating chips and type 2 diabetes risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The Food Standards Agency and Department of Health and Social Care both declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxQVnhnZ213UlpubUdmakNMTFo2eXYwNmRKRE5TLWgyNy1SR2tHZzZOQ09KNmZ4cWpuRzdlUUYyWjNDMURCaHJPVTJFZHZwWnhaMU85dU1PSjJSRi1IOHUyNXJqNjdVZVJTdnNudTVoYWlxMW5Hdy1iS1J6UTRKMEF4S3NsWUpJT0dVSGh2ejYyU3VEMF8xMVVaeVJYcTA5T2tQQUdJSU5NOHZEZGtydEFMYk5nanlBNU0</guid></item><item><title>我们对纽约军团病爆发的了解-切割</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxOMC0xc1RiSEtjaDFLbjd3Y0NHVUx2MTNINDVGd3RHemVabDVJNHRjdnVxdi1vNTI0QnNKcjBuYUJTcTVQalFzbEVJMl9meVMyRWRrTy1HYWl3cTEzdDl4d1pWYzJfbTAyTk9pcnFMTTBCZnNHOFI3bHJYZ2dpajA2VXkxSy10RnBYNW1sTDIzaw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="wwwthecut-zephr-anchor" class="article-content inline" data-editable="content"&gt;

Per the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/causes/index.html"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, the disease, a type of pneumonia that presents with flulike symptoms, is caused by bacteria that often spreads through manmade water systems and standing water. Here’s what we know.&lt;/p&gt;

There are several strains of it, some of which cause Pontiac fever (a related but less severe version of Legionnaire’s) or don’t cause symptoms at all. The strain that causes Legionnaires’ disease is especially dangerous because of the way it infects the body by invading human cells, using their nutrients to grow and spread.&lt;/p&gt;

Dr. Bernard Camins, the medical director for infection prevention at the Mount Sinai health system, says the bacteria often spreads through infected water supplies like a building’s boiler, a city water tank, or cooling towers, the mechanical systems that large buildings use to force hot air out. After a severe &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2015/09/1-dead-13-sick-in-recent-legionnaires-wave.html"&gt;2015 outbreak in the Bronx&lt;/a&gt; that killed 13 people, New York City passed a &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/business/permits-and-licenses/cooling-towers.page"&gt;local law&lt;/a&gt; requiring the owners of buildings with cooling towers to register, maintain, and test their systems, which is typically done by adding chlorine. That policy may not have prevented this outbreak, but increased testing is likely the reason it was caught early.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cme0gset900213b78n29tc8tc@published" data-word-count="106"&gt;For the most part, &lt;em&gt;Legionella &lt;/em&gt; is present in water systems at fairly low levels, but it becomes more common in warmer months when water temperatures increase, since the bacteria proliferate in warm, shallow water. Though the numbers we’re seeing in the current outbreak are concerning, Dr. Camins says physicians get warnings about the disease from the Department of Health ahead of every summer. “It will continue to happen annually,” he explains. “In this situation, we’re more concerned because multiple people are being affected; it’s usually just single patients, so we definitely know that a common source is affecting a lot more people than we would like.”&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cme0gsevc00223b781jcy28ok@published" data-word-count="111"&gt;The New York &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/06/nyregion/legionnaires-disease-outbreak-harlem-new-york.html"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the bacteria has been detected in 11 cooling towers in Central Harlem in the past few days, which are most likely spreading the disease via water vapor. In large buildings, &lt;a href="https://paramount-mech.com/resources/what-is-a-cooling-tower-used-for-in-commercial-buildings-manassas-va-washington-dc/"&gt;cooling towers&lt;/a&gt; stop a building from getting too hot by expelling the heat into the atmosphere via evaporation. “Many of these have fans on top of them and they’re basically blowing these aerosols,” explains Dr. Phillips. The problem is, those aerosols can contain &lt;em&gt;Legionella&lt;/em&gt;. That also means the disease does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; spread from person to person. According to Dr. Phillips, “You don’t generate enough aerosol, as a person who’s sick, to make somebody else sick.”&lt;/p&gt;

Dr. Camins says that with Legionaires’ disease specifically, you’re more likely to experience nausea and other GI issues.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cme0gsf1800243b78wrszwlsk@published" data-word-count="48"&gt;Dr. Phillips says that because of the unique way it attacks the cells, Legionnaires’ tends to be a particularly severe form of pneumonia. That’s why, he says, so many people end up hospitalized, and the mortality rate can be as high as 10 percent during a given outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cme0gsf4k00253b78wg38cccr@published" data-word-count="83"&gt;Since the bacteria specifically spreads from water source to person, outbreaks like this one are pretty strictly geographic, says Dr. Phillips. The &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/legionnaires-disease.page"&gt;department of health&lt;/a&gt; has listed five Zip Codes in Central Harlem that are currently affected: 10027, 10030, 10035, 10037, and 10039. But beyond that, the patients with the highest risk are those who are immunocompromised or have other comorbidities. Dr. Camins says smokers, people with lung cancer or lung disease, or over the age of 50 are at a higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cme0gsfa300273b78gc8m9mq2@published" data-word-count="53"&gt;Dr. Phillips also says that certain medications can affect immunity, including those that treat inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer. “There’s many more patients taking those drugs now than even there was ten years ago,” he explains. “That’s a population that could get Legionnaires’ more severely and certainly should be on guard for symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;

Yankner, a professor of genetics and neurology at Harvard Medical School, reported that they were able to reverse the disease in mice and restore brain function with small amounts of the compound lithium orotate, enough to mimic the metal’s natural level in the brain. Their study appeared Wednesday in the journal Nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EB4MSG4DZNC4HHYF3XTPKBP6HE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The obvious impact is that because lithium orotate is dirt cheap, hopefully we will get rigorous, randomized trials testing this very, very quickly,” said Matt Kaeberlein, former director of the Healthy Aging and Longevity Research Institute at the University of Washington, who did not participate in the study.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“And I would say that it will be an embarrassment to the Alzheimer’s clinical community if that doesn’t happen right away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QXKVHM6ZRJB55LJK27E4ELPV64" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Yankner, who is also the co-director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for Biology of Aging Research at Harvard, said: “I do not recommend that people take lithium at this point, because it has not been validated as a treatment in humans. We always have to be cautious because things can change as you go from mice to humans.” He added that the findings still need to be validated by other labs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DHATDXAVV5HCPCBXRVXYPZ5DLY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Although there have been recent breakthroughs in the treatment of Alzheimer’s, no medication has succeeded in stopping or reversing the disease that afflicts more than 7 million Americans, a number projected to reach almost 13 million by 2050, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures?utm_source=google-grant&amp;amp;utm_medium=paidsearch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=google_grant&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=42054366&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwqKzEBhANEiwAeQaPVUjBaDn58VEfdFkEC4B0qUR6WsJTK8H1CbpNhyX3SHj3bahuhKGLnRoCSTQQAvD_BwE#quickFacts" target="_blank"&gt;Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UYH2DMX3SNDVBDM2AAVDEW33MU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Lithium is widely prescribed for patients with bipolar disorder, and previous research indicated that it held potential as an Alzheimer’s treatment and an antiaging medication. A 2017 study in Denmark suggested the presence of lithium in drinking water  might be associated with a lower incidence of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K66TNJRMKJBZLLBJJHQFOOUFSY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;However, the new work is the first to describe the specific roles that lithium plays in the brain, its influence on all of the brain’s major cell types and the effect that its deficiency later in life has on aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3AUKWROFEBFKJN6A4UUPUIE5TE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Results of the study by Yankner’s lab and researchers at Boston Children’s Hospital and the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center in Chicago also suggest that measuring lithium levels might help doctors screen people for signs of Alzheimer’s years before the first symptoms begin to appear.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have conducted the largest-ever genetic analysis of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), a typically lifelong condition that affects people's ability to exert physical effort and can be debilitating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="brdx-unit-1" class="brdx-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.decodeme.org.uk/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.decodeme.org.uk/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DecodeME study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which recruited over 15,000 people of European ancestry with the condition, revealed that eight stretches of the genome were tied to the syndrome. These had not previously been linked to ME/CFS. The gene variants found in these locations are also found in some healthy individuals, the research suggests. But in people with ME/CFS, the variants are likely to act alongside environmental factors to increase people's risk of the condition, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings "provide the first robust evidence for genetic contributions to ME risk," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://edwebprofiles.ed.ac.uk/profile/chris-ponting" target="_blank" data-url="https://edwebprofiles.ed.ac.uk/profile/chris-ponting" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Chris Ponting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a bioinformatician at the University of Edinburgh, said at a news conference Wednesday (Aug. 6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study has been released as a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/initial-findings-from-the-decodeme-genome-wide-association-study-" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/initial-findings-from-the-decodeme-genome-wide-association-study-" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;preprint &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;by the University of Edinburgh and has not been peer-reviewed yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="brdx-unit-2" class="brdx-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estimates suggest ME/CFS may affect &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10434940/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10434940/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;67 million people worldwide&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, although the exact prevalence is uncertain and research into how the disease manifests and how to treat it has been glacially slow. This is partly because of disputes in the field about what characterizes the disease's key symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, leading psychiatrists &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6482658/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6482658/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;positioned ME/CFS as a psychological condition&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These discredited theories suggested that the syndrome — whose symptoms include &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-brain-fog" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-brain-fog"&gt;&lt;u&gt;brain fog&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, fatigue that is not relieved by rest, and chronic pain — was driven by patients' mental states and lack of exercise. These ideas emerged, in part, because the few clinical investigations done on ME/CFS could not pinpoint biological changes tied to the syndrome or a clear trigger for the observed symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/it-took-the-rug-right-out-from-under-my-life-milestone-mecfs-study-begins-to-explain-disease-but-will-it-lead-to-treatments" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/it-took-the-rug-right-out-from-under-my-life-milestone-mecfs-study-begins-to-explain-disease-but-will-it-lead-to-treatments"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'It took the rug right out from under my life': Milestone ME/CFS study begins to explain disease, but will it lead to treatments?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qnoZnZEj9rBHf3ry85zC8D" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qnoZnZEj9rBHf3ry85zC8D slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the new work adds to mounting evidence that links the condition to dysfunction in the nervous and immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings will provide credibility and validity to the experience of people with ME," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.actionforme.org.uk/people/sonya-chowdhury/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.actionforme.org.uk/people/sonya-chowdhury/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sonya Chowdhury&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of the ME/CFS charity Action for M.E., said at the news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DecodeME involved genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which are genetic analyses that look for links between common variations in the genome and other traits, such as the presence of a given disease. The study conducted two separate GWAS on about 15,600 ME/CFS patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients' genomes were compared with those of people without ME/CFS whose genetic information was previously recorded in the UK Biobank, which includes data from 500,000 U.K. adults. Together, the two GWAS identified eight loci — locations in the genome — that were strongly associated with whether or not a person had ME/CFS. At these key locations, they marked out the genes most likely to influence a person’s risk of developing the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These genes included several linked to immune function. One was &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=BTN2A2" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=BTN2A2" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;BTN2A2&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which a previous study showed could &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_7812213842204848684&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-021-98443-5&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fgenetics%2Fhuge-study-of-me-cfs-reveals-genetic-hotspots-linked-to-the-debilitating-syndrome" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-98443-5" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-021-98443-5&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fgenetics%2Fhuge-study-of-me-cfs-reveals-genetic-hotspots-linked-to-the-debilitating-syndrome" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;influence the function of T cells&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which are key to fighting germs.

The authors say this link may help to explain ME/CFS patients' hypersensitivity to light, sound and touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic links do not reflect changes wrought by the disease — instead, they hint at the biological systems that influence how vulnerable people are to developing ME/CFS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors made some efforts to replicate their data by looking at whether these same associations could be drawn using 13,800 ME/CFS cases recorded in the UK Biobank and in the Netherlands' Lifelines database, another large cohort study. However, after statistical correction, none of the associations were replicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This may reflect poor or inconsistent diagnosis data in those other datasets, rather than flaws in the DecodeME findings themselves," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/staff/dr-amy-mason" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/staff/dr-amy-mason" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Amy Mason&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a research associate at the University of Cambridge who was not involved with the study, told the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-unpublished-preprint-on-the-decodeme-genome-wide-association-study-of-me-cfs/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-unpublished-preprint-on-the-decodeme-genome-wide-association-study-of-me-cfs/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;U.K. Science Media Center&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Long COVID&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — a long-lasting condition that emerges after a COVID-19 infection and affects many systems in the body — has been noted to share &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/long-covid-mecfs-and-the-importance-of-studying-infection-associated-illnesses" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/long-covid-mecfs-and-the-importance-of-studying-infection-associated-illnesses" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;symptoms with ME/CFS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, DecodeME didn't identify any of the same genetic signals found in a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_1774242947088305846&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41588-025-02100-w&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fgenetics%2Fhuge-study-of-me-cfs-reveals-genetic-hotspots-linked-to-the-debilitating-syndrome" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02100-w" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41588-025-02100-w&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fgenetics%2Fhuge-study-of-me-cfs-reveals-genetic-hotspots-linked-to-the-debilitating-syndrome" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;similarly sized GWAS analysis of long COVID&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this year, Ponting said. At this point, it's unknown why that might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ME/CFS is a highly sex-biased disorder; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meresearch.org.uk/sex-differences-in-mecfs/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.meresearch.org.uk/sex-differences-in-mecfs/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;roughly 80% of patients&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are female. The DecodeME study didn't identify any strong sex links, but Mason pointed out that the team did not look at the X or Y chromosomes, where &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Sex-Linked" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Sex-Linked" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;sex-linked traits&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; might be found. The analysis also focused entirely on people of European descent, which may limit its value towards patients from other ancestries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors hope that DecodeME will be a jumping-off point for further research, which could explore the genetic signals in more detail and pinpoint the biological mechanisms they suggest are involved in ME/CFS. For now, the findings cannot advance diagnostics or screening for the condition, Ponting said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is an urgent need for studies that target these regions that dig down … to determine why each of these signals is linked to ME," he said, "so that we cannot just move towards, but accelerate towards, future diagnostics and treatments."&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/12/11/trump-stephen-hahn-fda-covid-vaccine/"&gt;first covid shots&lt;/a&gt;, based on mRNA, were in people’s arms less than a year after the United States recorded its first coronavirus case — a signature achievement of the first Trump administration. The flexible technology provided a road map for how to quickly respond to pathogens that are constantly evolving, including H5N1 avian bird flu, a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2024/12/05/bird-flu-mutation-human-cells-new-research/"&gt;candidate to&lt;/a&gt; spark the next pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Q49NV8HZU138DBD44AHBZEA9PG" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But research into H5N1 mRNA vaccines were among nearly two dozen mRNA projects supported by the government’s biodefense agency that were terminated or altered, according to a Department of Health and Human Services &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-winds-down-mrna-development-under-barda.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; released Tuesday.

      &lt;p&gt;Most of us have heard you need 10,000 steps a day to stave off health problems, but new research is finding that number is not necessary — though more is always better.&lt;/p&gt;   
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AILSA CHANG, HOST: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How many steps should you take in one day? I mean, many of us have heard 10,000 is the number to aim for, but that was never based on solid science. Researchers have combed through the data and they've come up with a more accurate target. NPR's Will Stone has more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WILL STONE, BYLINE: Scientists have made big strides in the science of step taking in recent years. Melody Ding is an epidemiologist at the University of Sydney. She says the technology for counting is everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MELODY DING: It's hard not to track it because there are so many devices, you know, like wearables, our phone. It all tells us, you know, roughly how many steps we take every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STONE: So when Ding set out to update the physical activity guidelines for Australia, she ended up taking on a massive review of the evidence, analyzing data from 160,000 adults on the link between their daily step count and the risk of dying, cancer, cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes and dementia. Ding says they found the sweet spot hovers around 7,000 steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DING: The 7,000 steps tend to be the range where there seems to be diminishing return on investment for increasing more steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STONE: In other words, 10,000 or even 12,000 steps did not significantly reduce your health risk beyond what you'd already get from reaching 7,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DING: So the risk will still continue to go down for some of the outcomes beyond 7,000, but the added benefits become smaller and smaller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STONE: Another big takeaway - they found sizable benefits for any steps above the bare minimum of 2,000. For example, doubling that to 4,000 was associated with a 36% lower risk of dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DING: That's message No. 1 from the study - any steps is good, even when you're at low levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STONE: They also checked if speed made a difference, but Ding says, here, they couldn't make any definitive conclusions. The study was published in the journal Lancet Public Health, and it echoes what Amanda Paluch has seen in her own research. Paluch is a physical activity epidemiologist at UMass Amherst. She says they've noticed age makes a difference, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMANDA PALUCH: We were seeing that older adults did not seem to need as many steps compared to younger adults. So older adults older than 60, the kind of the range where we started to see that plateau was six to eight for an older adult versus eight to 10 for a younger adult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STONE: Paluch likes this new research in the Lancet, but cautions some of the findings are preliminary because they're not yet based on many studies. Dr. William Kraus, a cardiologist and researcher at Duke, worked on the 2018 U.S. Physical Activity Guidelines. He'd love to see step count targets be included one day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WILLIAM KRAUS: Because they're objective measures, right? Everybody has a phone now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STONE: The current guidelines recommend at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise a week for adults. Kraus says time spent exercising or taking steps ultimately reflects the same thing - the link between health and energy expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KRAUS: Because anything is better than nothing, more is better than less. That's what the evidence says, right? So everybody wants to know how little I need to do. That is the wrong question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STONE: Because if you aim for the high end, you will maximize your chances of getting the most benefits, even if those are incremental. And there's another reason to do extra - all that time spent in a chair. While it wasn't part of this new study, Kraus says past research shows you need to aim higher than 7,000 or even 10,000 if you spend eight hours a day sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KRAUS: If you get 13,000 steps, you get the same thing as somebody who doesn't sit. Which if they don't sit, that means they're getting steps, right? If you're not sitting, you're doing something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STONE: Though Kraus says there's nothing magic about steps. You can convert miles to swimming or cycling. Melody Ding at the University of Sydney says she likes to think of movement in the same way as diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DING: Just like we need a balanced, healthy diet, it's important for us to have balanced physical activity, training throughout the week as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STONE: Get those steps, but also make time for mobility and strength training. All of it adds up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Stone, NPR News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;article itemprop="articleBody"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about using a CPAP machine to quell sleep apnea?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not necessarily a good idea for everyone, a new evidence review argues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This common treatment for sleep apnea might increase some folks' risk of heart attack, stroke and heart-related death, according to results published today in the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf447" target="_blank"&gt;European Heart Journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPAP machines can dramatically lower a person's heart risk if severe sleep apnea causes dramatic drops in blood oxygen levels or large surges in heart rate, researchers found by analyzing data from more than 3,500 participants in three major clinical trials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But CPAP might escalate heart health risk among people with milder sleep apnea, particularly if the condition doesn't cause them to feel sleepy during the daytime, results show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that CPAP may offer long-term cardiovascular benefit in people with high-risk obstructive sleep apnea, but may have unintended harmful effects in those without high-risk OSA," lead researcher &lt;a href="https://sleep.hms.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/ali-azarbarzin" target="_blank"&gt;Ali Azarbarzin&lt;/a&gt;, a sleep medicine investigator at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said in a news release.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep apnea occurs when the muscles in the back of the throat relax, causing a person's airway to collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These folks tend to snore, and if the airway collapses completely their breathing can start and stop throughout the night, causing them to repeatedly wake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous positive airway pressure machines blow air through a face mask as a person sleeps. The air pressure prevents the person's airways from closing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep apnea has been previously linked to &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/cardiovascular-diseases/coronary-heart-disease-645474.html" target="_blank"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, researchers noted. It's been reported to increase the risk of heart failure by 140%, &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/stroke/stroke-what-it-is-types-symptoms-causes-risk-factors-treatment-prevention-2" target="_blank"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; by 60% and heart disease by 30%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But prior studies of CPAP treatment for sleep apnea have not shown a clear benefit to heart health from the devices, Azarbarzin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to clarify CPAP's heart benefits, Azarbarzin and colleagues pooled together data from three separate trials that tested CPAP for people with sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results showed a clear benefit for people with high-risk sleep apnea that causes dramatic changes in blood oxygen and heart rate. Overall, these patients had a 17% lower risk of heart attack, stroke and heart-related death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in people without high-risk sleep apnea who don't feel sleepy during the day, CPAP appeared to increase their risk of serious heart problems by 30%, researchers said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For people with high-risk OSA, CPAP likely helps by preventing low oxygen levels and calming the overactive sympathetic nervous system during sleep," Azarbarzin said. Both are linked to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But in people without these high-risk markers, who are already at very low cardiovascular risk, CPAP seems to have downsides," Azarbarzin added. "While we don't really know why, one possibility is that the pressure used in CPAP may stretch the lungs in a way that puts stress on the cardiovascular system. Another is that CPAP could disturb sleep for some people, and sleep disruption itself is a risk factor for cardiovascular problems."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results indicate the need for personalized treatment of sleep apnea, Azarbarzin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Instead of treating everyone the same, we should consider whether someone has high-risk features," Azarbarzin said. "These are the people who seem most likely to benefit from CPAP."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, more research is needed to better understand the potential risks posed by CPAP, Azarbarzin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"CPAP-related harm was seen only in non-sleepy patients with existing heart disease, according to the design of trials analyzed in this study," Azarbarzin said. "Whether this applies to other patients remains unknown and needs further research."&lt;/p&gt;
