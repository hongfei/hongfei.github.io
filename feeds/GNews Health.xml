class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Parkinson’s is a progressive neurological condition in which nerve cells in the brain are lost over time. This leads to a reduction of the chemical dopamine which plays an important part in controlling movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This new test, which the Times reports costs £80, analyses small pieces of genetic material known as transfer RNA fragments (tRFs) in the blood, focusing on a repetitive RNA sequence that accumulates in Parkinson’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It also looks at a parallel decline in mitochondrial RNA, which deteriorates as the disease progresses. Mitochondria exist inside cells and generate energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;By measuring the ratio between these biomarkers, researchers said the test “offers a highly accurate, non-invasive, rapid and affordable diagnostic tool, providing hope for early interventions and treatments that could change the course of the disease”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;On a scale where a score of 1 indicates a perfect test while 0.5 shows the test is no better than flipping a coin, the test scored 0.86, the Times reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The best clinical tests presently used on patients showing early signs of the disease scored 0.73, according to the study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00851-z?utm_medium=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_source=commission_junction&amp;amp;utm_campaign=CONR_PF018_ECOM_GL_PBOK_ALWYS_DEEPLINK&amp;amp;utm_content=textlink&amp;amp;utm_term=PID1612532&amp;amp;CJEVENT=747e1c9817a211f0827c006b0a18b8f6&amp;amp;countryCode=de#Sec1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The test uses the same PCR technology used during the pandemic to confirm Covid cases. It works by amplifying the genetic material being targeted, which allows it to be detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This discovery represents a major advancement in our understanding of Parkinson’s disease and offers a simple, minimally invasive blood test as a tool for early diagnosis,” said Prof Hermona Soreq of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, who supervised the study. “By focusing on tRFs, we’ve opened a new window into the molecular changes that occur in the earliest stages of the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof David Dexter, director of research at Parkinson’s UK, said: “This research represents a new angle to explore in the search for a biological marker for Parkinson’s. In this case the marker can be identified and measured in the blood which makes it attractive for a future patient-friendly diagnostic test for Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“More work is needed to continue to test and validate this possible test, especially understanding how it can distinguish between other conditions that have similar early signs to Parkinson’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study was led by PhD student Nimrod Madrer under the supervision of Prof Soreq at the Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences and the Alexander Silberman Institute of Life Sciences, at the Hebrew University, in collaboration with Dr Iddo Paldor from the Shaare Zedek Medical Center, and Dr Eyal Soreq from the University of Surrey and the Imperial College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 16:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxQNUdydzdIU0RHRjZpdGw2U3QtekplMS0tWVlHdDkybWNDOWIwQmtFMDhSdHVLVE1mcjE1S0lXNTg5QThZWG8tZ2VmbFF5SXJLZFQ4MjZzWDZUdE5mNERVQUhWRlpJUGtrNHZSMC1PUGVlbUxMMzJhVzg2ektZbWl4V3E4bXQtdmRrVXFNS3FYYlhuOWticy10QzBKNUhxeVVNN2dLem5qMXFpNllEMDczS3doMA</guid></item><item><title>脑酶限制了药物复发的风险 - 神经科学新闻 | Brain Enzyme Limits Risk of Drug Relapse - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE92V3JTelBDeFJpR2ZJSjBteWhnOW5ra0VxV2J6bVhDVks0WTAwbWljaHJqNmJOUUdQOW1EZjdEYmNabnZWdHducHkzeE5WQXY1Um1kT3U0ZUliV2RTYV85OGhOZ2hIQlE1ajAwWGhR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research reveals that the enzyme HDAC5 plays a critical role in suppressing a gene (Scn4b) that regulates brain activity associated with drug-related memories, which are central to relapse in substance use disorders (SUDs). By limiting expression of Scn4b, HDAC5 reduces the excitability of neurons in the brain’s reward system, weakening the formation of powerful drug-environment associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that SCN4B influences cocaine relapse-like behavior without affecting natural reward-seeking, highlighting it as a potential drug-specific therapeutic target. These findings offer a deeper understanding of addiction’s biological roots and open new avenues for relapse prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HDAC5 Role:&lt;/strong&gt; HDAC5 suppresses the gene Scn4b, limiting neuron activity that underlies relapse-triggering drug memories.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drug-Specific Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; SCN4B influences cocaine seeking without affecting natural rewards like sucrose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Treatment Target:&lt;/strong&gt; These mechanisms identify SCN4B as a potential target for relapse-specific addiction therapies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Elsevier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New research on the biological basis of addiction has found that the critical epigenetic enzyme histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) limits the expression of the gene &lt;em&gt;Scn4b&lt;/em&gt;, regulating neuronal activity and thereby the formation of strong drug-related memories, which can trigger relapse in individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study in &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, detailing these epigenetic mechanisms in the brain, uncovers a new molecular target for the development of novel SUD treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108661"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This suggests that SCN4B governs a form of drug-specific plasticity that creates prepotent drug-environment associations that can promote relapse. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUDs affect many individuals in the United States directly or indirectly. Drug-related deaths remain at an all-time high in the US and stimulant use specifically is on the rise worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite ongoing efforts, rates of SUDs have remained relatively stable over the past three decades, indicating a need for continued focus on treatment and prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the neurological basis of addiction, often considered a complex biobehavioral illness, holds potential for broader insights into human decision-making, motivation, and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUDs are characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use despite adverse consequences, and relapse affects a large proportion of individuals with SUD attempting to discontinue drug use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One major contributor to relapse risk is the presence of enduring associations between the primary rewarding effects of the drug and cues in the drug-use environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Krystal, MD, Editor of &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, comments, “People say that once you have experienced compulsive substance use, your relationship to that substance can never return to the pre-addiction state. How could these long-lasting associations be sustained?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One possibility is that there are long-lasting changes in the pattern of gene expression that encode these drug memories and that prevent these memories from weakening. This study points to epigenetic mechanisms, one of the processes regulating gene expression patterns on a long-term basis, as a key regulator of relapse-related cocaine consumption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-lead investigator Christopher W. Cowan, PhD, Department of Neuroscience, Medical University of South Carolina, explains, “In this study, we discovered that a critical epigenetic enzyme HDAC5 functions to limit the expression of Scn4b, which limits the firing of key neurons in the nucleus accumbens, an important brain region linked to SUD and reward-related behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Together with our prior work, our findings show that HDAC5 and SCN4B, via regulation of neuronal excitability, selectively limit the formation of powerful and long-lasting links between the drug use environment and the drug use experience that can later serve as triggers of relapse in individuals with a SUD that are attempting to abstain from a return to active drug use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a highly collaborative multilevel study, investigators deployed a wide array of research techniques, including tandem mass spectrometry, enzymatic activity assays, computational modeling, quantitative mRNA analysis, patch-clamp electrophysiology, and rat cocaine and sucrose self-administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant results is the new finding that a sodium channel auxiliary protein, SCN4B, functions to limit relapse-like cocaine seeking but without affecting seeking of a natural reward, sucrose. This suggests that SCN4B governs a form of drug-specific plasticity that creates prepotent drug-environment associations that can promote relapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-lead investigator Daniel J. Wood, MD, PhD candidate, Department of Neuroscience, and Medical Science Training Program, Medical University of South Carolina, notes, “Finding new ways to help people recovering from SUD remain abstinent is as important as ever. The fact that SCN4B is selectively involved in the relapse-like cocaine seeking, but had no effect on sucrose seeking was very surprising to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“SCN4B might be a key puzzle piece toward uncovering drug-induced maladaptive plasticity that drives prepotent drug-environment associations and relapse vulnerability, and it represents a novel therapeutic target for developing treatments that reduce relapse risk in SUD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Krystal concludes, “The deeper neuroscience probes into addiction, the more we uncover fundamental molecular processes that drive or constrain drug seeking. This novel mechanism may point to new treatments for cocaine use disorder, for which there are no current pharmacotherapies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this addiction and genetics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#01696c726c6465686041646d7264776864732f626e6c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eileen Leahy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://elsevier.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Elsevier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Eileen Leahy – Elsevier&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2025.01.027" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Epigenetic control of an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated sodium channels regulates the strength of drug-cue associations and relapse-like cocaine seeking&lt;/a&gt;” by Christopher W.

Epigenetic factors, like histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5), play a key role in regulating the formation of drug-cue associations, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used a combination of molecular biology, cultured cells, tandem mass spectrometry, deacetylase activity measurements, co-immunoprecipitation, and molecular dynamics simulations to assess HDAC5 structure-activity relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In male and female Long-Evans rats, we used viral-mediated expression of HDAC5 mutants in nucleus accumbens (NAc) to test effects on cocaine intravenous self-administration (SA) and cue-reinstated cocaine seeking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also used in silico analysis of single-nucleus RNA sequencing data, quantitative RT-PCR, viral-mediated expression of Scn4b shRNA, patch-clamp electrophysiology, and rat cocaine or sucrose SA to assess Scn4b’s effects on NAc intrinsic excitability and cued reward seeking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discovered that two conserved cysteines located near HDAC5’s catalytic domain were required for its intrinsic deacetylase activity, and that HDAC5’s deacetylase activity was required in NAc medium spiny neurons to limit relapse-like cue-reinstated cocaine seeking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, we found that HDAC5 limited cocaine, but not sucrose, seeking behavior by reducing NAc MSN intrinsic excitability through the deacetylase-dependent repression of &lt;em&gt;Scn4b&lt;/em&gt;, which codes for an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated sodium channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that HDAC5’s control of NAc &lt;em&gt;Scn4b&lt;/em&gt; expression governs the formation of cocaine-cue, but not sucrose-cue, associations through modulation of NAc MSN intrinsic excitability and drug-induced NAc plasticity mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 15:43:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE92V3JTelBDeFJpR2ZJSjBteWhnOW5ra0VxV2J6bVhDVks0WTAwbWljaHJqNmJOUUdQOW1EZjdEYmNabnZWdHducHkzeE5WQXY1Um1kT3U0ZUliV2RTYV85OGhOZ2hIQlE1ajAwWGhR</guid></item><item><title>致命的方式，您可以从饮食中获得肺癌 - 每日邮件 | Deadly way you could get lung cancer from your DIET - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxQVl9KQjc1OHhXTEctS1pFSE1MZFhneWlUVDQyb2RhRVhOS25zZlpkbE5RTDVfN3ZIbjNLcWxzWko5YzkwOE44WXF5SDQ5X3pvZXpJR1pYQWR1T3NmUko3a21tN3g5T2NjQ25nWWZra1hCWHRnQ3hleHdyaWY4TDNXRkJiWG4zYW5WRWZQV09UbTh6YURjQXNyNHRtT3QzOVAyR3BONtIBqgFBVV95cUxPeXhuNml4RWdsaG5xWGN0TGZ5bTUzZlhNa1hmazRNYnRLdklSbzRma0YwRG41UEFvU3NrOVQySV9Jcm9QRHZwTGM4cldzaWRiYTNsWVlpOWVxZDd4eTU4UldjQm43UUxfRXlhelo0OVU0Y2lxMTVSdEVMbnZ1d05VUjZwS1V5VnQ5NnZvSFVOZDRtaF9CbkdrSHFLNER2TGNCNWpLLWVaQUpXdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's no secret that maintaining a high-carbohydrate and high-fat diet is not the healthiest choice for your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But up until now, fat gain, cholesterol issues, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-141d1ae0-1711-11f0-a7fe-b90172f5b10b" class=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and other weight-based issues were considered the main consequences of a low-quality diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However,&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-unexpected-link-between-diet-and-lung-cancer-risk"&gt; recent research&lt;/a&gt; revealed that glycogen - the molecule that stores glucose - can be a catalyst for lung &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-141c5790-1711-11f0-a7fe-b90172f5b10b"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This means that your high fat, high carb diet could potentially lead to this deadly disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lung adenocarcinom is a type of non-small cell lung cancer, and also makes up 40 percent of all lung cancers that people have. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, which looked at the human tissue samples, found that those with lung adenocarcinom had much higher levels of glycogen in them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And when they tested on mice, researchers found that more glycogen actually made it easier for the lung cancer to spread and grow at a faster rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And when they experimented with eliminated glycogen, they found that the tumor growth became limited. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Research shows that a combination of a high-carbohydrate and high-fat diet can lead to lung cancer (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, translated to the foods we eat, glycogen comes from carbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When we work out, our bodies use up this glycogen and use it as a source of energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when we're not using it, it's stored away for later use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who have high-carb, high-fat diets end up making glycogen in surplus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The combination of the two is also important in this study, as researchers had a group of mice that had a high-carb diet, a high-fat diet, a combination of the both, and a control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The group of mice that was on both a high-carb and high-fat diet all had higher levels of lung cancer growth than any of the other groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This isn't the first time diets were looked at as potential factors of types of cancers - especially low-quality diets like high-carb and high-fat eating regimes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though in the past, the belief that diets can contribute to cancer were limited to pancreatic or liver cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Human tissue with lung cancer was found to show higher levels of glycogen in it (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Glycogen has been recognized as a feature of cancer cells, and as scientists are looking at its relation to cancer, more research is still required. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is also true for lung cancer, especially because higher levels of glycogen were not found in other types of lung cancer aside from lung adenocarcinom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But one thing for certain is that a link does exist - and that it's important to make healthy diet choices to avoid dangerous conditions including lung cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And things that contribute to a high-carb and high-fat diet like red meat and alcohol should be consumed in moderation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Your lungs and the rest of your body will thank you for it.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; More than half of American adults have &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7906963/sneaky-reasons-blood-pressure-is-high-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; (aka hypertension), a silent condition that raises the risk of heart attack and stroke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Yet, as prevalent as high blood pressure is, there are steps you can take to prevent it. One of the most powerful is diet. While there are lots of foods to protect against high blood pressure, there are others that can cause it. And research has found that one of the biggest offenders is processed deli meat. It’s so potentially troublesome that one study found that consuming as little as 17 grams of processed meat per day (slightly more than a half-ounce) may increase a person’s odds of hypertension.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re eating a deli sandwich while you’re reading this, don’t panic. One meal won’t cause hypertension. But there are important reasons to limit this blood pressure-raising food. Read on to learn why deli meat spells bad news for blood pressure, plus dietitian-approved alternatives to keep your numbers in check. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-processed-deli-meat-may-increase-the-risk-of-high-blood-pressure"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Processed Deli Meat May Increase the Risk of High Blood Pressure  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s High in Sodium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Food manufacturers add &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/can-you-eat-salt-if-you-have-high-blood-pressure-8412363" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sodium&lt;/a&gt; to deli meat to improve taste and help maintain texture and shelf life. “Deli meat is one of those foods where the sodium content can be surprisingly high,” says &lt;a href="https://hnd.buffalostate.edu/directory/drew-hemler-msc-rd-cdn-fand" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Drew Hemler, M.Sc., RD, FAND&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and lecturer and advisor in multidisciplinary studies at Buffalo State University. “A standard 3-ounce portion—just a few slices—can deliver a serious sodium hit.” Take deli ham, for instance. One 3-ounce serving packs roughly 750 milligrams of sodium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s roughly two-thirds of the maximum 2,300 mg of sodium most of us should eat in an entire day (and half the 1,500-mg limit the American Heart Association recommends for people with high blood pressure).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Why is sodium such a problem? “High sodium content may cause your body to retain water, increasing blood volume and putting extra pressure on your blood vessel walls, which directly impacts blood pressure,” says registered dietitian&lt;a href="https://www.patriciabannan.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Patricia Bannan, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;From Burnout to Balance&lt;/em&gt;. Considering the typical American consumes an average of 3,400 mg of sodium daily, every bite counts. Since even reduced-sodium deli meats can contain surprisingly high sodium, label reading is a must. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Contains Blood Pressure-Raising Preservatives &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sodium isn’t the only additive in processed deli meat that’s bad for blood pressure. Many deli meats also contain added nitrates and nitrites. These ingredients are added during processing to improve color and flavor and protect against bacterial contamination. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It doesn’t help that these substances are confusing! While &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7959424/what-are-nitrates-are-they-bad-for-your-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nitrates and nitrites naturally found in fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; have been found to be beneficial for blood pressure and heart health, nitrates that are added to processed foods, like deli meat, have the opposite effect. According to emerging research, added nitrites may raise blood pressure by narrowing the arteries.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In addition, these compounds have also been linked to insulin resistance, coronary heart disease and cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  So, it’s a good idea to limit them as much as possible. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Lacks Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you think of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, digestive health might be the first thing to come to mind. However, fiber also plays an important role in heart health, including blood pressure. In fact, research published in the American Heart Association’s journal &lt;em&gt;Hypertension&lt;/em&gt; recommends dietary fiber as a treatment for blood pressure control. That’s because fiber is believed to feed your good gut bacteria, helping them produce blood pressure-lowering compounds called short-chain fatty acids.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Trouble is, deli meats are completely devoid of fiber. Better bets are naturally fiber-rich whole foods, like fruits, vegetables, beans, lentils, chickpeas and whole grains. These foods are staples of the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/289964/7-day-dash-diet-menu/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt;, an eating plan with a long, proven track record for lowering blood pressure. But if a turkey sandwich is your only option, order it on whole-wheat bread and pile on the lettuce, tomato, avocado and onion for fiber.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-foods-to-focus-on-for-healthy-blood-pressure"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Foods to Focus On for Healthy Blood Pressure &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While deli meat may be trouble for blood pressure, there are lots of foods you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; eat to improve your numbers, like these.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fruit. &lt;/strong&gt;Fruit is rich in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290053/8-foods-with-more-potassium-than-a-banana/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;, a key nutrient for healthy blood pressure. This mineral works by balancing the blood pressure-raising effects of sodium in our diets. &lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Both fresh and dried fruits are great ways to get more potassium, especially apricots, prunes, bananas and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7866075/number-1-food-to-lower-blood-pressure-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;watermelon&lt;/a&gt; (our favorite food for lower blood pressure!). Plus, they’re also rich in fiber. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vegetables. &lt;/strong&gt;Like fruits, vegetables are loaded with potassium. And they’re among the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2057241/top-high-fiber-foods-you-need-in-your-life/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;best sources of fiber&lt;/a&gt;. Top choices include potatoes, beets, leafy greens, avocados, beans and legumes. Thanks to quick, convenient options like bagged salad and spinach, canned beans and lentils and frozen veggies, getting your fill is easier than you might think. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low-Fat Dairy and Dairy Alternatives. &lt;/strong&gt;Low-fat dairy is another DASH diet staple that’s rich in blood pressure-regulating potassium and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7944074/foods-with-more-calcium-than-milk/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;calcium&lt;/a&gt;. “Calcium supports contraction and relaxation of blood vessels,” says Hemler. “You don’t need to stick to dairy. Yes, milk and yogurt are great, but leafy greens like kale and bok choy, tofu, almonds and calcium-fortified plant milks also count.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole Grains. &lt;/strong&gt;In addition to dietary fiber, whole grains provide &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2052607/10-signs-youre-not-getting-enough-magnesium-and-what-to-do-about-it/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, which also supports healthy blood pressure. “Magnesium keeps blood vessels relaxed and helps regulate other key minerals like calcium and potassium,” says Hemler. To make sure you’re getting the most bang, opt for 100% whole grains when choosing bread, pasta and cereal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fatty Fish. &lt;/strong&gt;Fatty fish are rich in DHA and EPA,&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="6"&gt; long-chain omega-3 fats&lt;/a&gt; that have been shown to reduce blood pressure. While all fish are good for you, salmon, mackerel, anchovies, herring and sardines are the best sources of these heart-healthy fats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water. &lt;/strong&gt;“Consistent fluid intake like water keeps your blood volume stable and helps your kidneys flush out excess sodium,” says Hemler. “When you’re even mildly dehydrated, your blood vessels can constrict, and your blood pressure may increase.” In addition to water, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/17576/8-hydrating-foods-to-help-you-meet-your-water-goals/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="7"&gt;hydrating foods&lt;/a&gt; like cucumbers, melons, oranges and lettuce can also help you get the fluids you need, he says.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Deli meats deliver a double-edged sword when it comes to high blood pressure. On one end, they’re filled with blood pressure-raising sodium and nitrates. On the other, they’re low in fiber, which helps protect against hypertension. That’s why deli meats are the No. 1 food to limit to reduce your risk of high blood pressure. We’re not saying you can never eat a ham or turkey sandwich again, but the fewer deli meats on your plate, the better. So, next time you need a quick lunch from the deli, order a tuna sandwich on whole-wheat bread instead. Your heart will thank you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Using brain imaging in both mice and humans, the study found that brain regions involved in social behavior were hyperconnected in childhood but under-connected after puberty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These shifts appear linked to changes in synaptic structure, particularly a sharp loss of dendritic spines after puberty. Inhibiting a key protein, GSK3-beta, partially restored connectivity in mice, highlighting a potential therapeutic target for neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connectivity Flip:&lt;/strong&gt; Brain regions in 22q deletion were overconnected before puberty, under-connected after.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synaptic Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Post-pubertal drop in dendritic spines correlated with disrupted social behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targetable Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; Inhibiting GSK3-beta restored connectivity and spine density in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCLA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changes in brain connectivity before and after puberty may explain why some children with a rare genetic disorder have higher risk of developing autism or schizophrenia, according to a UCLA Health study.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developmental psychiatric disorders like autism and schizophrenia are associated with changes in brain functional connectivity. However, the complexity of these conditions make it difficult to understand the underlying biological causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By studying genetically defined brain disorders, researchers at UCLA Health and collaborators have shed light on possible mechanisms. “&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108665"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two kids and brains." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The protein GSK3-beta, which is involved in synapse regulation, may play a role in the connectivity changes.

It was really valuable to study this phenomenon across species,” Bearden said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mice that were genetically modified to mimic chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, Bearden and her colleagues at the Italian Institute of Technology found younger mice had a larger density of dendritic spines — small protrusions on brain cells used to communicate with other neurons via synapses — during childhood compared to wild-type (normal) mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the mice reached the equivalent of puberty, the number of dendritic spines sharply decreased compared to wild-type mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protein GSK3-beta, which is involved in synapse regulation, may play a role in the connectivity changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bearden and her collaborators used a drug to inhibit GSK3-beta, which worked to temporarily restore brain activity and dendritic spine density in the mice, possibly by regulating the removal of dendritic spines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging of humans with the condition also found the brain regions affected by the connectivity changes had enriched genes related to GSK3-beta. Further, the brain connectivity changes were related to social behavior in humans, suggesting that the altered wiring contributes to autism traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings, Bearden said, suggests that synaptic dysfunction drives the changes in brain activity and could be a target to prevent or reduce symptoms caused by chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings strongly suggest that over-weeding of synapses during development may contribute to the behavioral challenges we see,” Bearden said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was co-led by Alessandro Gozzi of the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia in Rovereto, Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this autism research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#83f4ebecf6f0f7ecedc3eee6e7ede6f7adf6e0efe2ade6e7f6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Will Houston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucla.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Will Houston – UCLA&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adq2807" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Synaptic-dependent developmental dysconnectivity in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome&lt;/a&gt;” by Carrie Bearden et al. &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synaptic-dependent developmental dysconnectivity in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion increases the risk of neuropsychiatric disorders like autism and schizophrenia. Disruption of large-scale functional connectivity in 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) has been widely reported, but the biological factors driving these changes remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used a cross-species design to uncover the developmental trajectory and neural underpinnings of brain dysconnectivity in 22q11DS. In LgDel mice, a model for 22q11DS, we found age-specific patterns of brain dysconnectivity, with widespread fMRI hyperconnectivity in juvenile mice reconfiguring to hippocampal hypoconnectivity over puberty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes correlated with developmental alterations in dendritic spine density, and both were transiently normalized by GSK3β inhibition, suggesting a synaptic origin for this phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, analogous pubertal hyperconnectivity-to-hypoconnectivity reconfiguration occurs in human 22q11DS, affecting cortical regions enriched for GSK3β-associated synaptic genes and autism-relevant transcripts. This dysconnectivity also predicts age-dependent social alterations in 22q11DS individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that synaptic mechanisms underlie developmental brain dysconnectivity in 22q11DS.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 14:59:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiY0FVX3lxTFBZbUtTM0Y1SlJqNU5KWXljemdKdU9LeDZITzl6QmJnT0RzdXQ1dTZtQkRvaGVPaGpLR0dIYlRPZ2VFM3poakpfNE9oWU9EOHZLX1hVODJyLWw4MUFraWExdVNjSQ</guid></item><item><title>Man’s seemingly harmless mistake after a night of drinking led to acute heart failure - nypost.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxPdGdsa3pOeEFNZkFjZW04bG4wLUU2QU5WUzhncWkwekptX0Y2OTNYSUE5cm9mR0JkX0plT3hSaDFqZjRXdkFvYXBiazJsc2QwaDVZMW9DVEdvQ2N5cmRsM2s4WnlMYkJUQ01idllmMWVvRGtZTGxFWDUyYWZxNkozVzRtYzFxUkQ0ZnFmczJNN09fTngwYlQ5bFR3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;Let’s be real: most of us don’t look our best after a night of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/12/16/health/study-findings-about-binge-drinking/"&gt;heavy drinking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So when one man woke up with a swollen face and puffy eyelids, he figured he was just paying the price of partying. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it wasn’t last night’s liquor coming back to haunt him. Instead, it was a rare and deadly heart condition — and one well-intentioned mistake nearly cost him his life. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Drinking alcohol can put stress on the heart, especially with heavy or excessive consumption. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Rido – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Three months, no answers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the swelling didn’t let up, the 33-year-old Chinese man sought medical help — but doctors came up empty.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial testing found no problems with his heart, but doctors noticed that he had unusually high levels of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/15/lifestyle/i-followed-trendy-carnivore-diet-and-ended-up-in-the-hospital-with-kidney-stones-this-was-my-daily-diet/"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; in his urine. They suspected that might explain the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/26/health/avoid-this-food-to-reduce-face-puffiness-according-to-dietitians/"&gt;puffiness in his face&lt;/a&gt;, handed him a prescription and sent him home.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;But his condition only got worse. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Soon, the swelling spread from his face to the rest of his body. His chest began to tighten. His abdomen swelled. And still, no one had a clear answer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After bouncing from appointment to appointment, he was finally admitted to the emergency room at Qilu Hospital in Qingdao — three months after the symptoms first appeared.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s when doctors finally uncovered the real cause: a ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm (RSOVA) — a rare and potentially deadly heart condition. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13256-025-05143-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Journal of Medical Case Reports&lt;/a&gt;, doctors wrote that they believe the rupture was likely triggered by “strenuous exercise” after drinking alcohol, which caused the face of the “previously healthy” man to swell. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Something to think about before hitting the gym &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/03/health/dietitian-reveals-what-to-eat-and-drink-to-cure-a-hangover/"&gt;hungover&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Patients with a Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm should avoid strenuous activities that could increase the risk of rupture.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Drazen – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A heart on the brink&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sinus of Valsalva aneurysms are rare, affecting just 0.09% of the population. Most people don’t know they have one until it ruptures, often triggered by activities like vigorous &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/04/lifestyle/doctor-reveals-the-disgustingly-small-amount-of-exercise-someone-needs-each-day-to-help-slashes-the-risk-of-cancer/"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; or heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When that rupture happens, symptoms can vary wildly: from &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/12/health/my-chest-pains-turned-out-to-be-flesh-eating-bug-i-was-minutes-away-from-dying/"&gt;chest pain&lt;/a&gt; and shortness of breath to fainting, fatigue — or, in this man’s case, a slow, creeping full-body swell.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Left untreated, RSOVA often leads to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/09/health/cardiologist-warns-commonly-prescribed-drug-is-toxic-for-heart/"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt; and death within a year. But with early diagnosis and surgical repair, the long-term survival rate is typically strong.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors who eventually diagnosed the 33-year-old patient said that earlier health care providers missed several “key indicators” — including a rumbling sound in the heartbeat that can be a sign of a rupture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;When the aneurysm ruptures, patients often experience sudden severe chest pain.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Anciens – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That misdiagnosis, they wrote, “delayed appropriate intervention” and allowed the patient’s condition to worsen, posing a “serious risk.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By the time he arrived at the emergency department at Qilu Hospital, his symptoms had escalated to full-blown acute &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/06/08/heart-failure-can-be-cured-with-natural-survivor-antibodies/"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Further testing identified an aneurysm that was affecting one of the heart’s four chambers — and doctors rushed him into emergency surgery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the rupture was successfully repaired, and 18 months later, the patient is recovering well with no complications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In their report, doctors said the case highlights why medical teams should be quicker to consider RSOVA in younger patients presenting with signs of heart failure — a condition that’s typically affects older adults. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is therefore important to develop a strategy for the early recognition of aortic sinus aneurysm rupture,” they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

A new study has uncovered that additional genetic players, particularly the &lt;em&gt;Commander&lt;/em&gt; gene complex, influence whether the disease manifests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using CRISPR interference to screen the entire genome, scientists identified how Commander proteins impact lysosomal function — a key cellular recycling system tied to Parkinson’s pathology. These findings not only clarify disease mechanisms but also introduce new targets for potential therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commander Genes Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; A set of 16 Commander proteins helps regulate lysosomal function, influencing Parkinson’s disease development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRISPR-Based Screening:&lt;/strong&gt; Genome-wide CRISPR interference revealed which genes modulate GCase activity and Parkinson’s risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Drug Pathways:&lt;/strong&gt; Enhancing Commander protein function may offer a therapeutic route to restore lysosomal health and slow neurodegeneration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A longstanding mystery in Parkinson’s disease research has been why some individuals carrying pathogenic variants that increase their risk of PD go on to develop the disease, while others who also carry such variants do not. The prevailing theory has suggested additional genetic factors may play a role.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this question, a new study from Northwestern Medicine used modern technology, called CRISPR interference, to systematically examine every gene in the human genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108653"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Future research will need to determine the extent to which the Commander complex plays a role in other neurodegenerative disorders that exhibit lysosomal dysfunction.

These harmful variants reduce the activity of an enzyme called glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which is important for cells’ recycling process in lysosomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it has been unknown why some people who carry pathogenic GBA1 variants develop PD whereas others do not. To address this, the current study identified Commander complex genes and corresponding proteins that modulate GCase activity specifically in the lysosome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By examining the genomes from two independent cohorts (the UK Biobank and AMP-PD), the scientists found loss-of-function variants in Commander genes in people with PD compared to those without it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that loss-of-function variants in these genes increase Parkinson’s disease risk,” Krainc said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New drug targets to improve lysosomal function &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lysosomal dysfunction — or when a cell’s recycling system malfunctions — is a common feature of several neurodegenerative diseases, including PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study reveals that the Commander complex plays an important role in maintaining lysosomal function, suggesting that drugs that help Commander proteins work better might also improve the cell’s recycling system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will need to determine the extent to which the Commander complex plays a role in other neurodegenerative disorders that exhibit lysosomal dysfunction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If Commander dysfunction is observed in these individuals, drugs that target Commander could hold broader therapeutic potential for treating disorders with lysosomal dysfunction,” Krainc said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this context, Commander-targeting drugs could also complement other PD treatments, such as therapies aiming to increase lysosomal GCase activity, as potential combinatorial therapy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Northwestern authors include first co-authors postdoctoral fellow Georgia Minakaki and research assistant professor of neurology Nathaniel Safren, as well as postdoctoral fellow Bernabe I. Bustos, and assistant professor of neurology Dr. Niccolo Mencacci.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Funding for this study was provided by Research Program Award (R35).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this genetics and Parkinson’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e08b93818d95858c938f8ea08e8f9294889785939485928ece858495" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kristin Samuelson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://northwestern.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Kristin Samuelson – Northwestern University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adq6650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Commander complex regulates lysosomal function and is implicated in Parkinson’s disease risk&lt;/a&gt;” by Dimitri Krainc et al. &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commander complex regulates lysosomal function and is implicated in Parkinson’s disease risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variants in &lt;em&gt;GBA1&lt;/em&gt; resulting in decreased lysosomal glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity are a common risk factor for Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Incomplete penetrance of &lt;em&gt;GBA1&lt;/em&gt; variants suggests that additional genes contribute to PD and DLB manifestation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using a pooled genome-wide CRISPR interference screen, we identified copper metabolism MURR1 domain–containing 3 (COMMD3) protein, a component of the COMMD/coiled-coil domain–containing protein 22 (CCDC22)/CCDC93 (CCC) and Commander complexes, as a modifier of GCase and lysosomal activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loss of COMMD3 increased the release of lysosomal proteins through extracellular vesicles, leading to their impaired delivery to endolysosomes and consequent lysosomal dysfunction. Rare variants in the Commander gene family were associated with increased PD risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, COMMD genes and related complexes regulate lysosomal homeostasis and may represent modifiers in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with lysosomal dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 13:47:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFBiQVJDQ0JPelc1RGd1dmtLMlV0RFZ2WE5vcnhGcWFRTHA0NEUwSDV4d2pwdkFRUmZYNDJNUmp2TDRMVm1fdndUV3dLWHJzOG1PMERTZGxDS3ktX2MxQUJCVmttSnYzSHdXcjBZM0J3</guid></item><item><title>How Childhood Abuse Impacts Parental Empathy - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTFBfeW1MWFJzT1RHU01aOGtSS3ZQd1hMTFhsVm9LenpOMHNfN0t0eFNUWTBNS1NsdzJsTkxPcDNWRlItVVRCaXBPeFFURy1oY0lqZWd4UGR4aThnTFFmT2VNdFYtN1FCV0J2ZFdfSWV1VTc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study sheds light on how childhood maltreatment can lead to impaired empathy and increased risk of child abuse in adulthood. Researchers found that mothers who experienced abuse as children often struggle with emotional empathy and depressive symptoms, both of which negatively influence parenting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emotional overwhelm from their children’s feelings can increase stress, making them more likely to perpetuate the cycle of abuse. Targeted interventions that address mental health and emotional regulation in parents could help disrupt this intergenerational transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empathy Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Childhood abuse is linked to heightened emotional empathy, which can increase distress and hinder healthy parenting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental Health Connection:&lt;/strong&gt; Depression mediates the relationship between childhood trauma and parenting difficulties.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cycle of Abuse:&lt;/strong&gt; Addressing emotional empathy and mental health in at-risk parents may help prevent the continuation of child maltreatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Fukui&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Childhood maltreatment (CM) is a complex issue that is often passed on through generations. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that parents who were abused as children may perpetuate a similar pattern of mistreating their children, creating a vicious cycle of abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key factor in perpetuating this cycle is impaired empathy in parents who grew up in abusive environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108649"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/child-trauma-parent-empathy-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/child-trauma-parent-empathy-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/child-trauma-parent-empathy-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/child-trauma-parent-empathy-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/child-trauma-parent-empathy-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/child-trauma-parent-empathy-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/child-trauma-parent-empathy-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/child-trauma-parent-empathy-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a mom and child." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/child-trauma-parent-empathy-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/child-trauma-parent-empathy-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/child-trauma-parent-empathy-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/child-trauma-parent-empathy-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/child-trauma-parent-empathy-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/child-trauma-parent-empathy-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/child-trauma-parent-empathy-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These findings suggest that CM indirectly increases the risk of abusive parenting by influencing the mothers’ emotional empathy and mental health. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply put, parental empathy, the ability to understand and respond to children’s emotions, plays a critical role in effective parenting. In fact, children who experience abuse tend to have reduced empathy by the age of eight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lack of empathy can persist into adulthood, making it difficult for them to provide the care and emotional support their children need, thus increasing the risk of CM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a recent study led by researchers from the University of Fukui, Japan, provides new insights into this complex issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in Volume 15 in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; on March 5, 2025, the study compared mothers who engage in maltreatment with those who do not, examining how their experiences of CM impact their ability to empathize, manage stress, and raise their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings highlight possible ways to break the cycle of abuse through targeted interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was conducted by Graduate Student Yuko Kawaguchi along with Assistant Professor Shota Nishitani, Associate Professor Takashi X. Fujisawa, and Professor Akemi Tomoda from the University of Fukui, Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to us about the rationale behind this study, Kawaguchi says, “We aimed to not only determine whether mothers engaged in &lt;em&gt;CM in a simplistic ‘either/or’ manner but also to understand the act of maltreatment from a more nuanced, spectrum-based perspective.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, the researchers conducted path analysis, a statistical technique that maps and tests relationships between multiple variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They compared 13 mothers who had experienced childhood abuse and engaged in maltreatment with a control group of 42 mothers who had no such history, examining how factors such as CM, empathy, and depressive symptoms influence parenting styles in both groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used a combination of psychological assessments and physiological measures to evaluate these factors. CM was assessed using the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) questionnaire and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empathy was measured using the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), depressive symptoms were evaluated with the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and parenting styles were assessed using the Parenting Scale (PS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed significant differences between the two groups. Mothers who had experienced CM scored higher on measures of childhood trauma, including physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, as well as neglect. These factors, in turn, increased their risk of engaging in CM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the researchers observed a significant positive correlation between the total CTQ score and affective empathy (IRI measure) and between affective empathy, particularly personal distress, and depressive symptoms (SDS score).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that CM indirectly increases the risk of abusive parenting by influencing the mothers’ emotional empathy and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, parents who experienced CM themselves were more likely to feel overwhelmed by their children’s emotions, making them prone to depressive symptoms and increasing their risk of engaging in maltreatment, thereby perpetuating the cycle of intergenerational abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research reveals that a history of abuse enhances emotional empathy, which in turn, influences parenting through its impact on depression,” says Kawaguchi, while elaborating on the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By addressing emotional empathy and depression, we can help break this cycle and prevent maltreatment from being passed down to the next generation,” she adds&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interventions to achieve this can include mental health support to mothers who have experienced CM and parenting programs that help mothers manage their emotional empathy effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, integrating insights from this study into parenting education, child welfare, and mental health interventions can foster healthier and more positive parent-child relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;All phases of this study were supported by AMED (20gk0110052, AT and SN), JSPS KAKENHI Scientific Research (A) (19H00617 and 22H00492, AT), (C) 22K02432 (SK and SN), and University of Fukui Research Farm Firm, University of Fukui (SK), a research grant from the Strategic Budget to Realize University Missions (AT), a Grant-in-Aid for Translational Research from the Life Science Innovation Center, University of Fukui (AT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this childhood trauma and empathy research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#99eaeaf2f6f1f6b4f2d9f8fdb7ecb4ffecf2ecf0b7f8fab7f3e9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Naoki Tsukamoto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://u-fukui.ac.jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Fukui&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Naoki Tsukamoto – University of Fukui&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-92804-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Effects of childhood maltreatment on mothers’ empathy and parenting styles in intergenerational transmission&lt;/a&gt;” by Yuko Kawaguchi et al. &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effects of childhood maltreatment on mothers’ empathy and parenting styles in intergenerational transmission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the intergenerational transmission of childhood maltreatment (CM) is crucial to prevent its perpetuation to future generations. The literature has revealed parental empathy to be a pivotal factor in this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parental empathy is the ability to comprehend and empathetically respond to the emotions and mental states of children; therefore, its impairment may result in challenges in parenting, ultimately contributing to CM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we explored the factors that undermine empathy and how they alter parenting practices, to uncover the process of intergenerational transmission of CM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate actual instances of CM, a comparative study was conducted between 13 mothers with a history of social interventions owing to CM and 42 mothers in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Path analysis was performed to examine the trajectory from adverse childhood experiences to maltreatment and explore their correlations with variables including affective and cognitive empathy, depressive symptoms, and parenting styles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that experiences of CM specifically enhanced empathy in the emotional domain in the maltreatment group.

Participants emphasized the need for tailored care and greater societal awareness to improve outcomes for autistic mothers and their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delayed Diagnosis:&lt;/strong&gt; Many autistic women were diagnosed only after their children received an autism diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional Amplification:&lt;/strong&gt; Motherhood intensified sensory sensitivities and anxiety for many participants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Gaps:&lt;/strong&gt; There’s a lack of trained healthcare professionals and adapted care protocols for autistic mothers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Universitat Jaume I&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An article of the Universitat Jaume I of Castelló published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Autism in adulthood&lt;/em&gt; has collected some of the needs detected in autistic women regarding motherhood, among them, the shortage of professionals with updated knowledge to identify autism and provide a better individualised attention or the convenience of a family and social support network that favours the transition to the experience of being mothers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article “Until I had my son, I did not realise that these characteristics could be due to autism: motherhood and family experiences of Spanish autistic mothers”, signed by the lecturer and researcher Irene García Molina and the Master’s student in Family Intervention and Mediation Mónica Cortés Calvo, collects the experience of nine Spanish autistic women, seven mothers and two who want to become mothers, aged between 29 and 58, who responded in an interview to open questions about motherhood and life as a couple, which were evaluated under a qualitative approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108645"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows moms and babies." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;They also stressed the importance of greater awareness of the characteristics of autism in women and in motherhood, so that the family can provide greater care and support, and at the same time, hospital protocols for pregnant autistic women can be adapted. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The selection of the participants was made through five of the most important autism foundations in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The themes that most interviewees agreed on were related to the need for healthcare professionals who can identify autism, as most of them were diagnosed after their children or another family member was diagnosed (and in some cases, the family doubted the diagnosis, believing that the mother was seeking attention).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also emphasized the importance of a good family relationship (partner and children) during the diagnosis process to increase self-acceptance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other aspects that most concerned the women about motherhood were the influence of sensory reactivity and anxiety because they saw many aspects of their motherhood and their relationships intensified, from pregnancy to more intimate experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also stressed the importance of greater awareness of the characteristics of autism in women and in motherhood, so that the family can provide greater care and support, and at the same time, hospital protocols for pregnant autistic women can be adapted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the opinion of the researchers, “it is important to collaborate with different groups in researching these issues (women, family and health professionals) to understand their priorities and offer them more personalised care, from pregnancy to parenting”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, they stress, “more research is needed to break down the barriers surrounding the intersection of motherhood and diversity and to offer greater understanding and acceptance to the people who interact with them”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the sample, although not representative of the population of autistic mothers due to the number of interviews, serve as a starting point for future studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers have not found any previous research on the experiences and needs of autistic Spanish women who are or want to become mothers and their relationships with their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those that exist are focused on children or are from countries with a different culture to the Spanish one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The project “Autistic mothers: pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding and parenting: motherhood in autistic women” has been possible thanks to the funding of the Social Commitment Award of the Santander Bank and the Universitat Jaume I of Castelló in 2022. Professor García Molina, member of the research group DEVELOP (Development and Educational Contexts), continues with the research on this topic, focused on mothers with autism and their families, as well as health professionals in the province of Castelló. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this autism and motherhood research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6a0e031c1f060d0b1f00032a1f0003440f19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mari Luz Blanco Burgueño&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uji.es" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Universitat Jaume I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Mari Luz Blanco Burgueño – Universitat Jaume I&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/aut.2023.0013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Until I had my son, I did not realise that these characteristics could be due to autism: motherhood and family experiences of Spanish autistic mothers&lt;/a&gt;” by Irene García-Molina et al. &lt;em&gt;Autism in Adulthood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Until I had my son, I did not realise that these characteristics could be due to autism: motherhood and family experiences of Spanish autistic mothers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is sparse regarding the motherhood experiences and family relationships of autistic women. Few studies use a qualitative approach to afford autistic mothers (and want-to-be-mothers) a voice. This is an analysis of the experiences of Spanish autistic mothers presented from their perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine autistic mothers responded to open-ended questions and verbalized their experiences of maternity and family relationships in writing or orally. Data obtained were analyzed using a qualitative thematic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We developed four main themes about the participants’ experiences: (1) autistic mothers were diagnosed after their autistic children (or close relatives) received their diagnosis; (2) role of the nuclear family (partner and children); (3) the influence of sensory processing on coexistence with the partner, and upbringing of the children, of autistic mothers; and (4) the influence of anxiety on coexistence with the partner, and upbringing of the children, of autistic mothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their experiences showed that the mother’s autism diagnosis can follow the diagnosis of an autistic child and highlighted the importance of a good relationship with their partners and children during the process, increasing their self-acceptance (Themes 1 and 2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the influence of sensory reactivity and anxiety intensified many aspects of their maternity and relations, from pregnancy to intimate experiences (Themes 3 and 4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, there is a need for greater understanding and awareness about the characteristics of autistic mothers in the Spanish context, so that family members or health care professionals could provide better individualized care for them—from their pregnancy to the upbringing of their children.&lt;/p&gt;

with your coffee, here are a few sweetener alternatives recommended by experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registered dietitian nutritionist Ilana Muhlstein, based in Los Angeles, shared some creative ways to sweeten your coffee naturally, including making your own nut milk at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Making your own nut milk "really makes you question why most store-bought versions come with six or more ingredients," said a dietitian nutritionist.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's amazing how simply blending almonds or cashews with water can produce a rich, creamy and completely clean plant-based milk," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It really makes you question why most store-bought versions come with six or more ingredients — many of which are gums, oils and added sugars."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/coffee-creamer-products-recalled-complaints-spoilage-illness" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Coffee Creamer Products Recalled After 'Complaints Of Spoilage And Illness';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Coffee Creamer Products Recalled After 'Complaints Of Spoilage And Illness'&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nutritionist added, "Just as people started realizing that nut butters should only contain nuts (and maybe salt), it's time we question what's lurking in our alt milks, too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way to sweeten coffee naturally is with cinnamon, which adds a "warm, subtly sweet flavor," Muhlstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cinnamon is also a "powerhouse spice," she said; it's packed with polyphenols that can help combat oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Cinnamon is a "powerhouse spice" that can help reduce oxidative stress and support healthy blood sugar.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Plus, cinnamon may help enhance GLUT4 expression, which supports healthy blood sugar levels by moving more glucose into your cells," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeCicco shared a recipe for frothed, grass-fed half-and-half with cinnamon and hazelnut extract, explaining how half-and-half is a more natural milk option, excluding gums, additives or preservatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/coffee-costs-content-creator-more-340-got-goosebumps" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Coffee Costs A Content Creator More Than $340: 'Made Me Feel Overwhelmed';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Coffee Costs A Content Creator More Than $340: 'Made Me Feel Overwhelmed'&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It also has a thick and creamy texture and taste, which works well in a frother," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whenever a milk is frothed-heated, it creates a more creamy texture and brings out its natural sweetness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Grass-fed half-and-half is a healthier option than processed creamers, a dietitian nutritionist told Fox News Digital.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stir in some cinnamon for antioxidants and natural sweetness, DeCicco suggested, followed by some hazelnut extract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/bomb-squad-baker-coffee-maker-former-deputy-crushes-business" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:From Bomb Squad To Baker And Coffee Maker: Former Deputy Crushes A New Business;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;From Bomb Squad To Baker And Coffee Maker: Former Deputy Crushes A New Business&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People don't realize just how sweet cinnamon actually is without any sugar," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vietnamese Saigon cinnamon is the sweetest variety and is very medicinal.

"Imitation versions often contain additives like caramel color and artificial flavorings, which I'd recommend skipping."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to vanilla, adding coconut milk can make for a great naturally sweetened vanilla coconut cream coffee, DeCicco said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Coconut milk contains healthy fat that provides energy and can support gut health.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Canned coconut milk is a great option for coffee, as opposed to the 'coconut creamers' that are full of sugar, emulsifiers and gums," she said. "You want at least some real fat in the coconut milk to keep it thick and tasty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coconut milk is a good source of fat that provides energy to the body and is said to support gut health, according to DeCicco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Lifestyle Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Lifestyle Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mixing coconut milk with vanilla extract and a tiny bit of a plant-based sweetener makes for a tasty coffee drink," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While chocolate is a crave-worthy sweet treat, it can be high in sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But mixing pure cacao with coffee can be one way to satisfy cravings in a healthier way, DeCicco recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Raw cacao is "excellent for anti-aging and anti-inflammation."&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Try blending up raw cacao powder with coconut oil and a pinch of sea salt for a true coffee dessert," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raw cacao powder is "one of the most antioxidant-rich foods on the planet," according to the nutritionist, so it's &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:"excellent for anti-aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;"excellent for anti-aging&lt;/a&gt; and anti-inflammation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"High in fiber, iron and magnesium, it's a true superfood and has a rich yet bitter chocolate taste," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Sweetened coffee is a must for some people, but it could bring some health risks.

Doctor Chris van Tulleken revealed a startling comparison, suggesting that one food we often consume could be deadlier than smoking itself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As an infectious diseases specialist and &lt;a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/all-about/bbc" rel="Follow" target="_self" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section-topic"&gt;BBC &lt;/a&gt;science presenter, Dr Chris isn't the only van Tulleken making waves with health knowledge; his twin brother, Dr Xand van Tulleken, is also a familiar face on shows including 'BBC Morning Live'.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the discussion about his book 'Ultra-Processed People,' Dr Chris delved into our complex dietary choices: "For a very long time, we have been incredibly confused about what to eat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"We've called the foods that harm us junk food and processed food - high fat, salt and sugar food. We've not had a way of labelling food even as a pandemic of disease taken over the world."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The repercussions of a poor diet are felt worldwide and hit hardest among the financially challenged, as Dr Chris highlighted: "This is particularly true in low income countries and particularly true with low income people living in the UK", reports &lt;a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/doctor-says-one-food-worse-35039377" rel="Follow" target="_self" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link"&gt;the Mirror&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He made a stark revelation when he declared, "So poor &lt;a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/all-about/diet" rel="Follow" target="_self" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section-topic"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt;, which means a diet high and ultra processed foods (UPF), has overtaken tobacco as a leading cause of early death on planet Earth for humans, for the animals we farm and for wild animals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"This is because ultra-processed food is produced by food system that is the leading cause of loss of biodiversity and the second-leading cause of carbon emissions and the leading cause of plastic pollution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"So about 12 years ago, the definition was developed to describe a western industrial American diet. And it was done by a team in Brazil, and much of the best work on this stuff has been done by teams in Central and South America."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He revealed that this is because in countries like Mexico, Columbia and Brazil, "obesity was essentially unheard of and within a decade, it went to being the dominant public health problem". Once upon a time you knew nobody who was obese, now just 10 years later, "everyone would know someone who had an amputation for type two diabetes."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But what's changed?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/all-about/health" rel="Follow" target="_self" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section-topic"&gt;doctor &lt;/a&gt;explained: "The only thing that has changed was the influx of, broadly an American diet of industrial processed foods. The definition was invented in 2009/2010 and we've had a decade evidence now that is very clear that it is ultra processed food that is responsible, not just for pandemic weight gain and obesity, but also for a long list of other health problems, including early death."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;UPF's, he emphasised, is just as addictive as tobacco, alcohol, gambling and drugs for some people, with this claim being evidence-based. And he warns that "nagging" someone to stop eating junk food in order to lose weight and become healthier is not helpful as it "pushes people towards doing things that are harmful and generally makes them more likely to do the thing you're nagging them about."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It has been shown in one study that "high UPF consumption is associated with an increased risk of a variety of chronic diseases and mental health disorders. At present, not a single study reported an association between UPF intake and a beneficial health outcome. These findings suggest that dietary patterns with low consumption of UPFs may render broad public health benefits."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another study seems to confirm this by concluding: "Higher UPF consumption was associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality risk, with multiple metabolic pathways playing mediating roles."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One YouTube user was moved to comment on a video, saying: "I cannot overstate how much Chris has changed my life in the space of just 5 months. In early June I watched a podcast in which he was a guest and he spoke about the same topic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Since the 6th June 2023, I've cut out ultra-processed food almost entirely from my diet. Initially I thought it'd be impossible to find foods without crap in it but it's actually been really easy. When I fancy a snack I have an apple or a few grapes, or some nuts. I have a variety of home cooked meals every night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"For breakfast I have a 'full fat' natural yoghurt (containing just milk) and occasionally I'll have toast with a organic jam or scrambled eggs on the weekend (bread sourced from a bakery)."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A mum has uncovered the secret to dropping nearly two-and-a-half stone: "The home cooked meals aren't what people would consider particularly healthy (plenty of meat, cheese, starchy foods) and I've not cut down on portion sizes. In the last five months I've gone from 112KG to 99.9 KG (as of yesterday). The only other lifestyle change I've made is to take a one-hour walk every week day. Other than this, I've done no other exercise in the last 5 months whatsoever."&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>RSVP Live</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 12:11:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE9MY3FuQ0sza3E4elJDZGRCUnJsSlUwY080aUlUZDRUdlVYTXd4SkNzOVN6UnJNWGpidk4zaHZSTDI1bG4tVjJMTDJxbEM2VnU2Y1hFQVpzLTZpekt0TEJqWlM5XzMtaC1hWGFuNk5PRE1Dc3U3VUFIN2FR</guid></item><item><title>A Sprinkle of Artificial Sweetener Could Help Battle Drug-Resistant Bacteria - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNNWFCV3V6bGNZVXZtOE9xSGFqc0lGQnRhTWJ0Y18wdUM0dnd1dXdtM2pRMEprbVBNOTRXVGxmb09NRElzQjdpWG40MHhJUXQxTThPa3BVbXdmUFVpVnhBT2VuaW1zUzltTThMbkJ1b2hoYTMtbVpxYjJPY1AxNm5ibk1aQlhkcHltQktwLWlGYVdwOXNxUUQzZmY1Q0ZjeHRLalBhbWFnWDQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/are-artificial-sweeteners-are-better-for-you-than-sugar-scientists-weigh-in"&gt;health effects of artificial sweeteners&lt;/a&gt; are still up for debate, a new study suggests they &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharin"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; might also be a surprising weapon in the fight against &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/nightmare-drug-resistant-superbugs-are-causing-more-deaths-than-previously-estimated"&gt;antibiotic resistance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by a team from Brunel University in the UK, the researchers behind the study ran controlled lab tests to see how &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharin"&gt;saccharin&lt;/a&gt;, a common artificial sweetener, interacted with bacteria. We know the chemical can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature13793"&gt;influence gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, including those critical to our health, and the researchers wanted to take a closer look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results, from a bacteria-bashing perspective, were impressive: saccharin caused serious disruption to the structures of several bacteria strains, inhibiting how easily they grew and multiplied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_157651" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-157651" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BacteriaDiagram.jpg" alt="Bacteria diagram" class="wp-image-157651 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BacteriaDiagram.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BacteriaDiagram-544x415.jpg 544w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BacteriaDiagram-600x458.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-157651" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers found saccharin had a significant effect on bacteria cells. (de Dios et al., &lt;em&gt;EMBO Molecular Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've identified a novel antimicrobial – saccharin," &lt;a href="https://www.brunel.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/articles/Sweetener-saccharin-shows-surprise-power-against-antibiotic-resistance"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Ronan McCarthy, microbiologist from Brunel University. "Saccharin breaks the walls of bacterial pathogens, causing them to distort and eventually burst, killing the bacteria."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Crucially, this damage lets antibiotics slip inside, overwhelming their resistance systems."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team put saccharin up against some particularly nasty and drug-resistant bacteria, including &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While the compound's effectiveness varied between bacteria types, these early results are promising, and suggest saccharin could be effective against multiple bacteria strains with some tweaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In further experiments into saccharin's bug-beating qualities, the researchers also developed a surgical dressing from the artificial sweetener. In lab tests on pig skin, it proved to be more effective than standard wound dressing materials like silver at reducing bacteria levels. It turns out that saccharin is something of a superhero in tackling bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is very exciting," &lt;a href="https://www.brunel.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/articles/Sweetener-saccharin-shows-surprise-power-against-antibiotic-resistance"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; McCarthy. "Normally it takes billions of dollars and decades to develop a new antibiotic. But here we have a compound that's already widely used, and it not only kills drug-resistant bacteria but also makes existing antibiotics more effective."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We urgently need new drugs to treat resistant infections – and saccharin could represent a new therapeutic approach with exciting promise."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stats on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-third-leading-cause-of-death-globally-in-2019-was-antibiotic-resistant-bacterial-infection"&gt;antibiotic resistance&lt;/a&gt; are pretty sobering. Bacteria that have evolved to be immune to the best drugs we have are on the rise, and are accounting for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drug-resistant-bacteria-expected-to-kill-tens-of-millions-by-2050"&gt;more and more deaths each year&lt;/a&gt; – with the annual figures now into the millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we are making some progress in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-dual-target-drug-could-make-antibiotic-resistance-100-million-times-harder"&gt;fighting the threat&lt;/a&gt; of these superbugs – including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/achilles-heel-of-drug-resistant-bacteria-has-been-found-scientists-say"&gt;finding new vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt; that could be used to take down drug-resistant bacteria – the worry is that they're the ones winning the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it's early days, saccharin could be a huge help in catching up, so we need to see how it works in clinical treatments before progress can be made. It's also important to bear in mind &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/heres-what-diet-soft-drink-could-be-doing-to-your-health-in-the-long-term"&gt;the full range of effects&lt;/a&gt; that artificial sweeteners can have on the body, which &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/some-artificial-sweeteners-may-have-a-not-so-sweet-impact-on-our-bodies"&gt;may not all be positive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Antibiotic resistance is one of the major threats to modern medicine," &lt;a href="https://www.brunel.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/articles/Sweetener-saccharin-shows-surprise-power-against-antibiotic-resistance"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; McCarthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Procedures such as tooth extractions and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="157648" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; treatment often rely on antibiotics to prevent or treat infection. But doctors are increasingly facing cases where the drugs no longer work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44321-025-00219-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;EMBO Molecular Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Keep up a quick walking speed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.gov/our-work/nutrition-physical-activity/physical-activity-guidelines/current-guidelines" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="U.S. government guidelines note" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67f7fec7e4b09493c8d882a3" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://health.gov/our-work/nutrition-physical-activity/physical-activity-guidelines/current-guidelines" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;U.S. government guidelines note&lt;/a&gt; that adults need at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week, which can include brisk walking — but not walking at a snail’s pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moldoff said the intensity of aerobic activity is typically measured in relation to your heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it can be hard to know your exact heart rate during a walk, a good way to ensure you’re pushing yourself is to listen to a fast-paced song — starting at, say, 100 beats per minute — and then move to the music’s beat, Moldoff added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can simply do a &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/impact/topic/google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; search or even on Spotify or Apple Music, look for different genres of songs that may be enjoyable for individuals at 100 beats per minute, and then trying to sync your cadence to the beat of the song,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And if you’re following along [to a] song that is ... 100 beats per minute, you can be sure that after a few minutes you’ll start to work up a little bit of a breath and you’ll be hitting that moderate intensity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that tempo feels too slow for you, look up songs that are 110 or 120 beats per minute instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as a bonus, music makes walking more enjoyable, Moldoff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Try interval jogging or speed walking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re not quite ready to maintain a fast walking pace for all 30-plus minutes of your walk, consider incorporating a faster pace at select times during your workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nolan said that in Barry’s classes, instructors frequently do interval-based training, which you can try in your walk, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You can do [this] at home by incorporating short bursts of fast walking or even jogging to increase intensity,” Nolan stated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, you might start small with a 30-second jog or minute-long speed walk and increase the duration when your body feels ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: andreswd via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;andreswd via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Walking to music with a fast tempo can make your exercise more intense and help you maintain a fast pace.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Add strength training to your walk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You could also walk with light weights or do some simple body weight exercises like squats, lunges or pushups during points of the walk to work different muscle groups,” Nolan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start, simply plan your walk ahead of time and pick some designated places, such as your driveway or a local park, to do some body weight training. Writing out your workout in advance can also help you hold yourself accountable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might do five pushups, 15 crunches and a one-minute plank repeated three times, or whatever combination makes sense for you. Just be sure to switch up your strength workout to target different muscles in your exercise regimen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could also try walking with a &lt;a href="https://r.bttn.io?btn_ref=org-677cb81987ed72f9&amp;amp;btn_url=https://www.amazon.com/s?tag=thehuffingtop-20%26ascsubtag%3D67f7fec7e4b09493c8d882a3%252C-1%252C-1%252Cd%252C0%252C0%252Chp-fil-am%253D0%252C0%253A0%252C0%252C0%252C0" target="_blank" role="link" data-amazon-link="true" data-aps-asin="null" data-aps-asc-tag="null" data-aps-asc-subtag="null" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="weighted vest" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67f7fec7e4b09493c8d882a3" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://r.bttn.io?btn_ref=org-677cb81987ed72f9&amp;amp;btn_url=https://www.amazon.com/s?tag=thehuffingtop-20%26ascsubtag%3D67f7fec7e4b09493c8d882a3%252C-1%252C-1%252Cd%252C0%252C0%252Chp-fil-am%253D0%252C0%253A0%252C0%252C0%252C0" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;weighted vest&lt;/a&gt; or a backpack filled with books for an added challenge, Moldoff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Simply by doing that, you can help increase your metabolic rate, which improves your oxygen consumption, and that relates to a greater calorie burn,” he stated, adding that this can “strengthen the muscle groups of the leg.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Or walk along a hilly path.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking on a path with hills is another way to boost your daily walk, Moldoff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking downhill &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24754630/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="has been shown to improve" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67f7fec7e4b09493c8d882a3" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24754630/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;has been shown to improve&lt;/a&gt; muscle strength in the lower extremities and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23170753/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="reduce the stress" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67f7fec7e4b09493c8d882a3" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23170753/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;reduce the stress&lt;/a&gt; that’s put on the cardiovascular system, he stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, interestingly enough, it will likely be less stressful on our breathing and our heart rate,” Moldoff noted. “It will make it more comfortable, but at the same time, you’re actually improving your muscle strength more effectively relative to simply level walking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, walking uphill can provide more of a challenge to your cardiovascular system, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24472218/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="some research suggests" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67f7fec7e4b09493c8d882a3" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24472218/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;some research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that it can benefit people with knee joint issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter what you do to up your walking regimen, it’s important to stay consistent, said Nolan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The benefits of walking are best realized with regular, consistent practice,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Aim for at least 30 minutes most days of the week.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s important to take days off when you need them and listen to your body for any signs of pain or discomfort, Nolan added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may take time to build up enough strength and endurance to incorporate these walking challenges, and that’s OK.

They have lots of flexibility to them while still hugging the foot in the right places.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt; Decent cushion for the foot... like walking on a cloud. I normally wear a size 8, occasionally and 8.5 or even 9 depending on the brand and style of shoe. I ordered these in an 8 and the fit was perfect. My feet are a smidge on the wider side with my second toe being longer than the first. Will happily order another pair when these wear out :)" — &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://r.bttn.io?btn_ref=org-677cb81987ed72f9&amp;amp;btn_url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2O9SDLBKHJKJ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?tag=thehuffingtop-20%26ascsubtag%3D67f7fec7e4b09493c8d882a3%252C-1%252C-1%252Cd%252C0%252C0%252Chp-fil-am%253D0%252C0%253A0%252C0%252C0%252C0" target="_blank" role="link" data-amazon-link="true" data-aps-asin="null" data-aps-asc-tag="null" data-aps-asc-subtag="null" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Emily" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67f7fec7e4b09493c8d882a3" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://r.bttn.io?btn_ref=org-677cb81987ed72f9&amp;amp;btn_url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2O9SDLBKHJKJ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?tag=thehuffingtop-20%26ascsubtag%3D67f7fec7e4b09493c8d882a3%252C-1%252C-1%252Cd%252C0%252C0%252Chp-fil-am%253D0%252C0%253A0%252C0%252C0%252C0" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="" data-vars-position-in-subunit="44"&gt;Emily&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="listicle-item-container wrapped " data-vars-affiliate="Amazon"&gt;&lt;div class="listicle-item image"&gt;&lt;p class="title-container"&gt;A pair of lightweight Skechers walking shoes with breathable mesh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skechers is a big-name brand among shoe shoppers, and it's not hard to see why, when they make durable, supportive, and good-looking shoes like these.

I am a nurse and am on my feet all day. My shoes were worn out and I was in need of a new pair. I searched for a new pair but hate that athletic shoes are so speedy especially since I go through a pair about once a year. Then I found these. They were only $33 so even if they didn’t last for six months I wouldn’t be out that much money. So I took a chance. They arrived on time and when I looked at them I honestly wasn’t sure if I liked them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then I lifted them up and it felt like I didn’t have anything in my hand. They are so lightweight I couldn’t believe it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt; I put them on and they felt awesome. I have a very wide foot and sometimes have trouble finding a ahoe that fits my foot. These are wide enough for me and I even could have probably gone down a size. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They are so comfortable to wear and easy to slip on. My foot pain is gone since I started wearing these shoes two weeks ago.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt; I get so many compliments from my patients wondering where I got these shoes from.

They're called a "fashion sneaker," but don't think style is the only thing they're good for — the anti-skid grooves on the outsole will keep you from slipping as you walk, and they're suitable for a variety of life activities, from traveling to working out.

They're comfortable and feel great on my feet. They support really well and my feet don't slide around inside the shoe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The sole of the shoe are super comfortable and haven't torn easily like my other pairs.

Of course, they're practical, too: The insole wicks away moisture and reduces odor, while the midsole and outsole are equipped with Energycloud cushioning to keep your feet cool and comfortable.

I haven’t bought a pair of Reeboks in ages. But when I saw these I really liked the design. The reviews were good so I decided to give them a try. I have really high arches so I try to find shoes that can support my feet. I was worried that the size 8 I ordered might not be a true size 8. I’ve ordered shoes before that were not true to size, but I can honestly say these shoes are true to size. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With the cushion inserts the shoes have I don’t have any issues with my feet hurting because of my high arches. I could literally walk in this shoes for hours without any discomfort.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt; They are extremely lightweight.

They are designed to slide on and off. I see in other reviews where people reversed the shoe laces and tied them up.

Didn't expect to use them for hiking - but they worked perfectly. Kept my feet safe and comfortable after wearing them all day, walking up and down very steep hills and inclines.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your early-morning habits can have a surprising impact on weight loss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians recommend starting the day with water, a protein-rich breakfast and exercise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you sleep fewer than seven hours, getting more sleep may also help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you’re an early riser or someone who perpetually hits the snooze button, your morning routine can have a big impact on weight loss. In fact, what you do—or don’t do—before starting your day can either set you up for success or make it harder to stay on track later. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Building a healthy morning routine creates momentum to continue beneficial habits all day long,” says &lt;a href="https://melissamitri.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Melissa Mitri, M.S., R.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and owner of Melissa Mitri Nutrition. So, healthy morning habits—like eating a nourishing breakfast or going for a walk—can have a snowball effect, leading to more positive, weight-loss-supporting choices throughout the day. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What should you do first thing in the morning to enhance weight loss and start your day on a healthy note? To find out, we asked registered dietitians. Here’s their four-step game plan for success. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-make-sure-you-get-enough-sleep"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Make Sure You Get Enough Sleep &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you like getting a jump-start on the day, you might be tempted to set your alarm for the crack of dawn. However, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2060332/what-happens-to-your-body-if-you-dont-get-enough-sleep/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;skimping on sleep&lt;/a&gt; can derail your weight-loss goals. Getting less than the recommended seven hours of sleep doesn’t just leave you feeling groggy. “Inconsistent sleep habits can lead to increased appetite, poor food choices and an overall increase in calories,” says &lt;a href="https://mandyenright.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Mandy Enright, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and author of &lt;em&gt;30-Minute Weight Loss Cookbook&lt;/em&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even though waking up early may increase your calorie burn by getting you up and moving, it may still backfire if you don’t get enough sleep. For instance, one study found that even though short sleepers burned an extra 100 calories per day, they also consumed an additional 250 calories. That resulted in a net surplus of 150 calories daily. Over time, that can really add up!&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To complicate matters, research has also found that we tend to crave high-calorie foods when we don’t get enough shut-eye.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  If you’ve ever noticed that you crave something sweet or greasy after a poor night’s sleep, that’s your body looking for quick energy. Unfortunately, this can undermine weight loss, especially if it happens consistently. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to making sure you get the seven to nine hours of sleep you need nightly, try to maintain a consistent sleep schedule. This will help support your body’s natural signals that regulate hunger, metabolism and energy use, says Enright. She recommends going to bed and waking up around the same time each day, even on weekends. And if sleep still eludes you, these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7527638/how-to-sleep-better/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;expert-proven tips &lt;/a&gt;can help you get a better night’s sleep. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-drink-a-glass-of-water"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Drink a Glass of Water &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; How often do you get halfway through the day only to realize you haven’t had a single drop of water? Or, maybe your first stop after rolling out of bed is the coffee maker? Getting into the habit of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7988280/should-you-be-drinking-water-first-thing-in-the-morning/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;drinking a glass of water&lt;/a&gt; right after you wake up can do more than just help you meet your daily water goals. It can also do good things for weight loss. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Drinking a glass of water within 30 minutes of waking can support digestion, increase metabolism and prevent dehydration, which can sometimes be mistaken for hunger,” says Mitri.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It may even reduce cravings and make it easier to make healthier choices for the rest of your day, she adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s not all, says &lt;a href="https://bonnietaubdix.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Bonnie Taub-Dix, M.A., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, host of the &lt;em&gt;Media Savvy Podcast&lt;/em&gt; and author of &lt;em&gt;Read It Before You Eat It.&lt;/em&gt; One older study found that volunteers who drank roughly 2 cups of water 30 minutes before meals for 12 weeks dropped nearly 3 pounds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  The likely reason, says Taub-Dix, is that hydrating before meals promotes feelings of fullness that help you eat less overall.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re not in the habit of drinking water when you wake up, try keeping a glass or bottle of water on your nightstand for a visual reminder. Don’t love plain room-temperature water? Sip it warm with a squeeze of lemon or enjoy it ice-cold straight from the fridge. There’s no wrong way to hydrate. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-eat-a-protein-rich-breakfast"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Eat a Protein-Rich Breakfast &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We know you’ve heard it before, but breakfast is important! But not just any breakfast. If your go-to is a plain bagel or sugary cereal, it might be time for an upgrade. Research consistently shows that a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2053490/high-protein-flat-belly-diet-meal-plan/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-protein diet&lt;/a&gt; can support weight loss by preventing overeating and late-night snacking.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Why is it so effective? “Starting your day with a protein-rich breakfast can support weight loss by keeping you fuller for longer, reducing cravings and helping you eat fewer calories throughout the day,” says Mitri. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein also helps by reducing hormones that make you hungry while simultaneously increasing hormones that tell your brain you’re full. It additionally plays a key role in preserving calorie-burning lean &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-maintain-muscle-mass-while-losing-weight-8706542" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;muscle mass&lt;/a&gt;, adds Mitri. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, most of us don’t eat nearly enough protein with breakfast. To build a high-protein breakfast, think eggs, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, kefir, nuts and even legumes. Taux-Dix’s favorite make-ahead breakfast is a smoothie made of fresh fruit like berries, Greek yogurt, almond butter and a veggie such as spinach. She preps it the night before by tossing everything in the blender and storing it in the fridge. Then, in the morning, she blends it for a meal that’s ready in minutes. Need more ideas? These &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-protein-smoothies-to-make-forever-8364481" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;16 high-protein smoothies&lt;/a&gt; will keep you full and energized all morning long. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-get-moving"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Get Moving &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Exercising in the morning helps with weight loss in multiple ways. “Some research suggests morning movement can help boost fat-burning, rev up the metabolism and improve appetite control,” says Enright. She points to one study that found people who exercised moderately or vigorously in the morning had lower BMIs and a smaller waist circumference than people who worked out later in the day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This may be because, in a fasted state, your body is more likely to tap into fat stores for energy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Morning workouts may have another benefit that has nothing to do with burning fat or calories. Research has found that morning exercise is more likely to lead to positive food choices throughout the day, promoting more energy and overall healthier habits, says Enright. Morning activity may also encourage weight loss by promoting more regular sleep. It does this by regulating your circadian rhythm, which is your body’s internal clock that tells you when to wake up and go to sleep.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-spotlight--1-2-post mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight--1-2-post mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight mntl-block theme-1-2-post"&gt;&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight__heading_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight__heading mntl-text-block"&gt;Weight Loss Meal Plan to Try&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What you do when you roll out of bed in the morning can make a big difference when it comes to weight loss. If losing weight is a goal, dietitians recommend four specific steps. The first is making sure you’ve gotten enough sleep. Then, once you get out of bed, drink a glass of water, eat a high-protein breakfast and try to get some exercise. In addition to promoting weight loss, these healthy morning habits set a positive mindset that creates a snowball effect that lasts throughout the day. So, go ahead and seize the day!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Is it OK to mix and match meals if there’s one I don’t like?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels. For more inspiration, check out some of our other delicious&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/new-anti-inflammatory-dinners-to-make-this-week-8776887" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; anti-inflammatory&lt;/a&gt; recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 350 to 400 calories, while the lunches span 400 to 450 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a 1,200-calorie modification?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_201-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although there is no one-size-fits-all diet for reducing inflammation, research highlights that certain nutrients and food groups, such as vitamin D, omega-3-rich fish, nuts, seeds, dark leafy greens, beans, legumes, berries and deeply colored vegetables, offer anti-inflammatory benefits in the body. By incorporating a wide variety of these foods, this plan aims to help you reduce inflammation and lower your risk of developing chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer and cognitive decline.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; We’ve also excluded added sugar, which studies have shown is a major contributor to chronic inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Together, the combination of anti-inflammatory foods and removal of added sugar promotes a dietary pattern that prioritizes nutrient-dense foods.

Yes, it's a little smaller than the Saturday editions you've been used to through the winter, but it's not because I'm being some loser this morning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have 11 &amp;amp; 12 year old to manage for 90 minutes before playing indoor golf which then leads into the Taste of the Masters meal that I've been waiting for. That's a full Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real quick: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I forwarded the first Screencaps newsletter to around 100 of you at 5 p.m. ET Friday. I'm still getting some requests that have trickled in. Guys, I have to cut this off at some point. If you want the first edition, I will make one final forward on Sunday morning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Send me an email titled, "Hey, Joe, send me that Screencaps newsletter" and I will get it over to you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That said, I need you guys to get signed up: &lt;a href="https://www.outkick.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;https://www.outkick.com/newsletters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes, I know some of you are saying that the newsletter never arrived. Check those junk folders. The first one will have "Screencaps" in the title to make searching as easy as possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for those of you saying you signed up and it never arrived, I will ask T-shirt Manager Olivia G., who handles newsletter technical questions if there's a solution there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, finally, you'll have SeanJo on Monday morning. I will be out of town for about 14 hours for a work trip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;I didn't think this post would take off, but it has and people are hammering the inbox with their own takes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you haven't read the &lt;a href="https://www.outkick.com/culture/rfk-jr-asks-should-disgusting-americans-get-health-care-paid-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;RFK Jr. on doughnuts post&lt;/a&gt;, here it is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The premise here is simple: It's time to pump the brakes on ripping doughnuts when we talk about fat ass Americans when there are other consumer items that are way worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Deede agrees, it's time to stop attacking doughnuts: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No, attacking doughnuts is not the answer. We need to start teaching our kids what is healthy and how to cook healthy, tasty food. This needs to start young and continue through high school. I am amazed at the number of people that don't have any idea how to cook, or even make tuna salad. No wonder everyone eats out all of the time.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Barbara writes: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I think the solution to the obesity problem in the United States should follow the anti-smoking plan. Sugar is an addictive drug and should be labelled as such. You have to start with the children and teach them that sugar equals white death.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;— &lt;/i&gt;Jaime M. has an idea: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sir my suggestion to get America back into shape is to return to the 1950's physical fitness programs in school. If you return to fitness test to graduate high school or atleast requiring physical education courses through out our childrens education which means  kindergarten thru 12 grade. This focus on physical fitness at a young age will bring about a whole family focus on health &amp;amp; health eating habbits. Children will encourage the parents to refocus on health choices for the entire family. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Second advertisement the true ingredients &amp;amp; their effects on the body &amp;amp; health effects thru our childrens lives. The disclosure is vital as most Americans have no clue how addictive the sugary drinks &amp;amp; corn syrup in every food item is slowly killing us all.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Just a suggestion as we need healthy young Americans to fight China.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Don H. opines: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;For years, I've been saying that diets are ridiculous......just eat normal food and lay off the sugars. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Americans have an addiction to processed, industrialized, sugar and chemical laced foods. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;That being said, companies involved in the production of these foods spend millions of dollars testing ingredients to be added to certain foods in order to create a likable taste. They test humans by watching how the brain reacts(computer tomography) to certain additives. They are actually creating an addiction to their products........the same principle as the cigarette industry did years ago by increasing the nicotine in cigarettes to create an addiction. So I've been waiting for someone to file a lawsuit against these companies as was done against the cigarette industry. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yes, it's the fault of the consumer but so was the addicted cigarette smoker. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;My grandfather, who was a butcher and smoked Chesterfields all of his life, said 2 things to me in the early 1980s. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He tried a mcdonald's hamburger once and said "what in the hell is this"? He said it doesn't taste like a hamburger at all. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I asked if he was worried about getting cancer for smoking all of his life. He said, "hell no".....he tried another cigarette once and said "I don't know what they're putting in this cigarette but it's not just tobacco. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anyway, highest rates of obesity, autism, diabetes, heart diseases, hyper activity and cancers are in the USA. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don added: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Couple of other things...... &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I've lived in France since 1988. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In the grocery stores, there is always a huge vegetable and fruit section. Plus, with fresh meats, fish and cheeses in the same section. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A small section of cereals and carbonated drinks. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I live in Russia since 2022. Unfortunately, I was in the hospital for cancer treatment by which I am cancer free at the moment. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anyway, for breakfast in the hospital, I was served either oatmeal, creme of wheat or a corn flavored porridge. Kefir which a type of yogurt. 1 slice of brown bread and 1 white bread. An apple and a tea. Another day, a boiled egg, slice of cheese, slice of ham, a kefir, an apple and a tea. The same bread.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No sweet pastries!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I've rarely seen any obese children in France or Russia. In fact, I've travelled all over Europe and rarely seen any obese kids.....except a few in Italy....pasta!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;— &lt;/i&gt;Bob C. responds: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The article makes some very good points. We all have a choice when it comes to selecting foods, drinks and bad habits. The idea or rewards in insurance costs for good results is appealing. For my money RFK Jr is the first to attempt to tackle the criminal food processing scams and fake data usage in the medical field. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Additives that are bad for our health should not be permitted in our food. Other countries get it so why can't we? The current situation is quite frustrating to consumers trying to be responsible. We would need to memorize all the bad additives and all the cloaked derivative names for the bad additives. Most of us are not chemists and all of us deserve a good faith effort by the regulators, not to mention the food industry.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The medical services certainly know better about the big pharma scams but fail to protect us. There are good supplements that could be used until drastic intervention is required for worst cases. The certificated medical practitioners are the only option covered by insurance. Integrative medicine has much to offer but not being recognized means the alternatives are not regulated for safety. Each time the Dr tells me to "eat properly" I challenge that Dr. to fine properly and offer some supportive nutrition help. Not covered. The chemical solution; which invariable includes side effects that often range into worse than the disease, is the sole solution covered by insurance. The other herbie to overcome is dishonest FED agencies using dishonest data to support bad-for-my-health medicine.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Keep up the efforts to expose the sad truth about our available choices and recognize that the consumer fails to make good choices largely by design!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;— &lt;/i&gt;Gary K. tells me: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We are evolutionarily built to store calories.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Putting on weight is easy, taking it off ... is not.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;People can be convinced of even stupid things, like that men can have babies or all cultures are equally valid. So much so that it becomes people's identity (See loons keying Teslas).This means people can be socially programmed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;So show an ideal of "normal healthiness" and create expectations and people will gravitate toward that.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Remember: We all but eliminated snuff and reduced smoking by societal expectations.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;So:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;1) Bring back self-reliance: you are responsible for yourself.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;2) Bring back societal disapproval: people like to be liked and approved of.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;3) Caloric information on fast food and coffee products on the purchased package, just like at grocery stores&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— George says: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Regarding your article about RFK Jr.: it's a free country do whatever you want, consume whatever you want, just don't expect other people (tax payers) to pay for your health care.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Brad L. wants to make a couple of points: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I drink my coffee straight, no cream, no sugar.  Like the taste of the coffee itself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can't control genetics.  You can control behavior.  Get some tickets, have some accidents, pay higher auto insurance premiums.  No one bats an eye.  Why not let private insurers (get the government out of this) apply the same logic to health insurance?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Charles the Canadian shares his opinion: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hello, I am a Canadian who enjoys reading articles on Outkick.  Realizing I am Canadian, I don't know if you will care about my solution, but here it is:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Power to Act:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The government has the power to eliminate what is harmful to the citizens of its country.  Take red dye No. 3, for example.  The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned the use of red dye No. 3 in food and ingested drugs due to potential cancer risks observed in lab rats, despite not being a concern in humans. The FDA's action stems from a 2022 petition and the Delaney Clause, which prohibits the use of food additives found to cause cancer in animals or humans.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why Should the Government Act?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Obesity is associated with a higher risk of developing several types of cancer, including colorectal, post-menopausal breast, uterine, esophageal, kidney, and pancreatic cancers. Experts believe that excess body fat, especially visceral fat, can trigger inflammation, which may contribute to cancer development.  Obesity can lead to increased levels of hormones like insulin and estrogen, which can stimulate cell growth and potentially increase the risk of certain cancers.  Obesity is also linked to other conditions that can increase cancer risk, such as type 2 diabetes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Source of the Problem:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The simple answer is sugar.  Consuming more sugar than the body needs can lead to weight gain because the excess sugar is converted to fat and stored in the body.  Sugary drinks like soda, juice, and sweet tea are often high in fructose, a type of sugar that can increase hunger and make it harder for the body to regulate food intake, contributing to weight gain.  Drinking large amounts of sugary beverages is linked to an increase in visceral fat, a type of deep belly fat that is associated with conditions like diabetes and heart disease.  Numerous studies have shown a positive correlation between sugar intake and weight gain, with some studies finding that people who increased their sugar intake gained weight in a relatively short amount of time.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Possible Solution:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The FDA can force regulate the levels or amounts of sugar as a food additive.  This regulation would affect "Big Coffee" for example.  The high levels need to be addressed, as this addiction to sugar is contributing to obesity.  The obesity, in turn, contributes to cancer in humans.  If it can be done with red dye No. 3, it can be done with sugar.  This won't fix how much sugar humans consume on their own accord (teaspoons poured into coffee, chocolate bars consumed, etc.), but it WILL drastically reduce the amount consumed without the knowledge or understanding of humans as they order drinks at a "Big Coffee" producer/retailer.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Source of Information and Disclosure:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;All information was obtained through a simple Google search online.  I am not a doctor, nor do I have any expertise in weight gain causes or effects of weight gain in humans.  What is troubling is that this information is freely available, and yet the "Big Coffee" industry cares only about sales.  It's about time this stops.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kids and Cellphones in 2025: When is too soon?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a topic that Mrs. Screencaps are about to find us debating in the very near future as Screencaps Jr. heads into junior high. It's also a topic that a bunch of readers are not only discussing, but constantly thinking about. The inbox lit up Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Teacher Geoff advises: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I don't frequently drop everything that I'm doing and fire off an email in response to ScreenCaps, but parenthood topics will frequently get me involved! I've been a high school teacher for 10 years, and my wife has taught upper elementary for 15. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We've got four kids, oldest being a sixth grader. We're right there with you. Our oldest two have watches that let them call/text a handful of people, but don't let them participate in big text chains. My oldest is a boy, and having watched the cancel culture come after young men for ridiculous things that they've tweeted/texted when they were younger, I am very reluctant to put my son (or girls) in a situation where they can say things in an unsupervised situation that can be "circled back to" by others who would choose to do them harm. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Additionally, I have had so many conversations with high schoolers about how they "wish they didn't see so many things on Snapchat" or how "smart phones are so difficult to manage from all the distractions" that are inherent with those devices, that I don't think that the pros of better/more convenient digital communication are worth it. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It'll be a little bit different when little man is driving (we live in a Midwestern state where kids can start driving at 14), but even then, brick phones have value, too! I'm sure you'll get lots of emails on this one, and most of them will be very passionate! &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Jeff H. writes:&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Love the question.  We’ve got a lot of experience here – 7 kids and all, ranging from 22 down to 9.   The short answer is just like you parent each child differently, you make decisions like a cell phone uniquely for each kid.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our general rule has been not until you start driving, which for my oldest two was 17.  My 3rd is a social butterfly, so we got him a phone a little earlier, when he turned 16.  My only daughter is 15 and we got her a phone when she turned 15 because 1) we trusted her, 2) she is really into pottery and that means evenings at the pottery studio, so I wanted to be able to track her – made me feel better.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;But the younger boys won’t sniff a phone of their own until at least 16.  Are we too strict?  Maybe.  Will there be wailing and gnashing of teeth? Most definitely.  Do I care?  No.  Once they have a phone you can never go back.  You’re dealing with filters and phone trackers and watching content you can’t possibly screen.  Lot of management for very little actual benefit.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bottom line – EVERY other parent I’ve talked with about this has said they wish they would have waited longer to give their kid a phone.  EVERY. SINGLE. ONE.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Another topic that goes hand-in-hand with a phone is social media accounts.  Our standing rule, no exceptions, is not before 18.  We grew up just fine without social media and my kids will too.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Ron in Lake O, Oregon checks in on this one: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Good morning. Well if he already has the Apple Watch he is doomed so you may as well do the Apple Phone too.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Most schools have a no personal electronics during school hours policy now so kids seeing social media crap or texts from their friends doesn't, generally, happen between 0800 and 1600. You can take that statement with a grain of salt. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;After and before school the group texts are huge and using an Apple phone magnifies it. Personally I loathe Apple for various reasons and we were LG and are now Google Phone family. Except for our daughter who is a sophomore in HS. She paid for an iPhone with her own money so she could be in her friends' text groups and also HAVE THE RIGHT COLOR TEXT BOX. Yep, peer pressure,  FOMO, and the need to keep up even includes not being a greenie in a bluey world or the other way around. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;You can monitor everything now though so at least you can see what he is doing. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Chris B. in Johnson City is going through this in his household: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I have a fresh data point for you regarding kids getting phones. We just went through this in our house during the past few weeks.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;For background, my wife’s phone developed an "anomaly" a few months ago. This meant that she had to turn her phone to landscape in order to text.  She was growing frustrated with it but mine was fine. We had talked about getting the kids phones now that both are in middle school and stay after school for practices and such. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What really made us pull the trigger was my daughter making the cheer squad. At the first meeting, the girls were told to join an app and text group as the coach didn’t want texts from moms all the time. Being the youngest on the squad, and apparently the only one without a phone, my wife didn’t want to rock the boat. Verizon happened to send my wife an offer and, long story short, we got 4 new iPhone 16s.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yes, my daughter (11) and son (13) have 16s. It all happened a little fast, but I’ve been a little surprised. After a few days the novelty started to wear off. I don’t think my son has sent a single text. He got a game and plays it occasionally. He’s more interested in his 3D printer. My daughter texts with a few friends and cousins and has, thus far, kept any boys from getting her number. (Apparently, if you respond to a text from a boy, it means you’re "dating.") It even seems like she is annoyed with checking the app and group text each night.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It should be interesting going forward. My wife set up all the parental controls and I enjoy laughing at the texts between middle school girls after the kids go to bed. Maybe knowing that your parents can go through your phone at any moment put a damper on getting a phone as a young kid.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;— &lt;/i&gt;Joe M. says keep the kids out of text groups: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;You do not want your kid in one of these text/Snapchat groups.  The bullying kicks into high gear because everyone and their brother has a phone in sixth grade.  However, the kids also use FaceTime to work on group projects, which is ridiculous.  Ex wife bought my 12 year old a phone when he had an Apple watch, in the first week of 6th grade.  The assistant principal had to get involved the three days into school, because a couple of girls kept adding him to text groups that he repeatedly tried to leave, etc.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is also precisely when kids fall into the hole of YouTube and learn interesting things like how much instant money they can make starting a drop shipping business!  Yes, it’s a scam, but YouTube is the gateway.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;F cell phones for kids that aren’t driving.  Nothing good comes from them.  They can’t use them during school hours anyway in our school district.  If it hasn’t happened in your district yet, it’s probably coming.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;— &lt;/i&gt;Billy P. has thoughts here: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hey Joe! Long time reader of Screencaps. Regarding kids and cell phones, I've been really happy with how it has worked out with my oldest (now 17). We started him on a flip phone in 6th grade, he had that all through middle school. Got him a cheap Android ($100) for freshman year and then the cheapest iPhone (SE) sophomore year. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This year he got a job so he's upgraded to the iPhone 15 because he pays for it. Never had a lost or broken phone. Also, no social media. My original plan was to let him get on when he was 16 but he must have grown tired of asking about it. Phones go on the charger an hour before bed and they charge them outside their rooms. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Youngest (13) currently has a flip phone. He says he's embarrassed about it so he constantly forgets to bring it with him to school (which is a plus in my mind). But he can still call his friends, text in group chats, and we can get in touch with him when we need to.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Rob in Tennessee shares how this went in his house: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hey Joe, responding to the question about the correct age for kids to get a cell phone.  My kids weren't allowed to have one until age 13, and there were strict-but-reasonable rules that came with getting one:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;1) no social media apps allowed; don't bring that nonsense into my house&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;2) gotta ask before watching youtube videos, as they're not all age-appropriate or productive&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;3) phone does not stay in your room at night (no kid needs that temptation after bedtime - charge it on the kitchen counter or whatever designated central place)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;4) parents can inspect at any time.  (Never had to snoop on my kids, but they follow the rules.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;5) break the rules, and the phone goes away - not a threat, it's a promise&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The rules work.  We've never had any issues with online bullying, self-esteem problems, or doing stupid stuff to get "likes" or attention.  It's a win-win system, kids get to be able to communicate with you and not be a tech luddite or pariah amongst their peers, and you get to raise well-adjusted kids that aren't warped by tic-tok trends and unhealthy influences.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Screencaps reader finds himself at Augusta National for the second straight year&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Ricky A. writes: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Once in a lifetime experience has somehow morphed into two straight years at Augusta. From a friend being gracious with his four-ticket sweep to the Tuesday practice round last year (yes Joe I looked for you &amp;amp; crazy to find out you were no more than a hole away), to somehow having a last late cancellation of another friends family member lands me on the hallowed grounds for the first &amp;amp; second rounds. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Very surreal. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Notable observations: the area is still struggling. Once about 20 miles out driving in the damage around is very evident. Getting into Augusta still plenty of ravaged business buildings unable to reopen. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;As for the course? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I obviously don’t recall each &amp;amp; every tree, nor am I an arborist, but there are numerous trees across the course leaning/massively trimmed/clearly replaced. That said? Course is immaculate &amp;amp; words never do it justice. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Apparently it’s spring break around here. Amazing to see these (high school-ish) aged kids up &amp;amp; at the course at the wee hours putting in working hours &amp;amp; staffing a lot of the retail areas. In addition: I don’t know what some of you all are putting into your bodies to do things to these bathrooms, but have mercy is it unbearable at times. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yet these kids muscle up &amp;amp; keep the facilities running. No way what Bobby Jones had in mind when designing this place. Sheesh. Coolest thing? No clue what it’s called or even if they show it, but sat behind the green on 2, and there’s this black telescoping rod/whip deal that’s used to knock the sand off. Our entire group got more excited for this than any birdies made on the hole. Maybe it’s one of those things you just have to see to appreciate, but just seems like something primed for a TNML member looking for a high end detailing aid. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Been a wild past few days &amp;amp; greatly appreciate the opportunity. Let me end with this, never miss the opportunity if you have the ability to make it to the Master’s. If you don’t? The viewing experience from your home (or gathered with others elsewhere) is better than being at the course. Enjoy your taste kits for those lucky enough to score them. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Enjoy the viewing. Continue looking for ways to support those still in need of these areas. Thank you Joe &amp;amp; to those in Screencaps community for all you do. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kinsey:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was told by a local last year that it was Spring Break. Sounds like that's a yearly tradition, which makes sense for homeowners who rent out their places while they're on vacation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dan is the Masters patron who ran into Masters Anonymous Employee No. 1, who happens to be a Screencaps reader&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Dan in Mequon, Wisconsin writes: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Because of America's Greatest Daily Column (damn right), two random strangers standing next to each other at the 2024 Par 3 Contest in  Augusta, Georgia discovered that one was a Masters (anonymous) contributor and the other a daily reader.   Over a joke about a player's WAG we started a conversation, a realization of who the Master employee was, and now a friendship.   In honor of that encounter, this year I had to toast my friend from my home in Wisconsin.  But to continue the connection, Thursday, my son who was with me a year ago, attending this year's Masters stopped  by to see Employee #1 pouring beers.  Employee #1, keep the Masters intel and observations coming, and enjoy a beer on the patio at Augusta CC.   The pictures from earlier this week looked great.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Joe, on Monday you displayed pictures from last year's Masters trip, and I couldn't help but notice that one was very similar to my picture from 2006.   I didn't black out the ticket but it came from a Member who has subsequently passed, so I think I am safe. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I received the Wednesday newsletter and it was great.  Enjoyed the list of books so keep it coming to our inboxes.  I'll add the Daily Outkick that comes in the late afternoon is a nice summary of that day's columns and news bits.  It gives me an opportunity to circle back on anything I missed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;################&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is it for this Saturday morning. Helluva post for one that I slapped together at 6 a.m. after having myself a Bulleit old fashioned last night while watching Masters coverage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it's time to get this day rolling. It's cold. It's sunny. It's not baseball weather. But, we're going to get out there and get these kids running and sucking air. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go have a great Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Email: joe.kinsey@outkick.com or use my personal Gmail.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Numbers from :&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stuff You Guys Sent In &amp;amp; Stuff I Like : &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>OutKick</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 11:52:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNTXRqZW5yaTBDRGtWblY0Sk5FYk9GcHFjSGViNzVyajNpYWFVbTB5eEtYNG4tOFIwUUU5ZmtfdlNMeTBBVHI4SXIwRW5lOENPclNNUE01aWRlZGh4Ung0UTVRZEhiRTBFR0tkS2FmQVFWUFk2MVhYM2JPRWwtZ1dmVHFsX0NZY1BxWmc</guid></item><item><title>Doctors re-attach 'decapitated' Illinois woman's HEAD after she suffered horrific fall while exercising - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/illinois/index.html" id="mol-c20ecbb0-16fa-11f0-b2ca-475f2671fcab" class=""&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; woman has revealed how a horrific sports accident left her on the verge of being 'internally decapitated' and made her life miserable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Megan King was just 16 in 2005 when she leapt in the air to catch a soccer ball during gym class and fell to the ground, damaging her right ankle and spine and tearing the muscle off both shoulder blades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The teenager spent more than a year on crutches. Instead of her symptoms subsiding, more appeared. King's joints weakened and her muscles began to tear, and her shoulder blades ached in unbearable pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the years, she underwent 22 surgeries on her shoulders and shoulder blades alone, with doctors mystified as to why her body couldn't heal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It took 10 years for King to be diagnosed in 2015 with &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13540555/Id-love-push-daughter-swing-without-dislocating-joints-says-mother-suffering-rare-bendy-joints-condition.html"&gt;hypermobile Ehler's-Danlos syndrome (hEDS)&lt;/a&gt;, a genetic disorder that stops collagen — a key joint tissue — from forming properly and leads to joint instability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A year later, King's neck became dislocated and she was fitted with a Halo brace, a brutal contraption that screws directly into the skull to keep the neck from moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the process to remove the device, her skull nearly became detached from her spine, an almost always deadly condition called&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13388051/I-survived-internally-decapitated-drunk-driver-ploughed-me.html"&gt; internal decapitation or Atlanto-occipital dislocation (AOD)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;King, now 35, said: 'I flew my chair back to keep gravity from decapitating me. My neurosurgeon had to hold my skull in place with his hands. I couldn't stand. My right side was shaking uncontrollably.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Megan King was just 16 in 2005 when she fell in gym class. Her injuries worsened over the next two decades, which doctors later learned was due to hypermobile Ehler's-Danlos syndrome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;About 10 years after her initial injury, King's skull nearly became detached from her spine, an almost always deadly condition called internal decapitation or Atlanto-occipital dislocation (AOD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;King was rushed into emergency surgery, where doctors spent fused her skull back on to her spine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was a horror show. I woke up unable to move my head at all,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has now had 37 surgeries and is fused from her skull down to her pelvis, meaning she can no longer shift her head up, down, left or right. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A spinal fusion involves wo or more vertebrae - bones in the spine - are joined together to keep them from moving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;King said: 'I'm literally a human statue. My spine doesn't move at all. But that doesn't mean I've stopped living.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AOD occurs when the occipital bone at the base of the skull detaches from the atlas, the first or C1, the topmost vertebrae in the spine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The injury is fatal in over 90 percent of cases, as the damage disrupts nerve signals between the brain and the body, leading to paralysis around vital organs like the lungs and heart, impairing their function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stabilizing the head is crucial to keep it from separating further from the spine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AOD is more commonly seen in children and adolescents because the bones are not fully developed yet and may still contain cartilage. They're also more likely to have proportionally larger heads and weaker neck muscles than adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;King, now 35, said: 'I flew my chair back to keep gravity from decapitating me. My neuosurgeon had to hold my skull in place with his hands. I couldn't stand. My right side was shaking uncontrollably'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above iamge shows the fusions in King's neck and spine. She is now fused from her skull to her pelvis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;King is slowly regaining her ability to get back to hobbies she had before that fateful fall 20 years ago, including walking with her dogs and bowling&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About eight in 10 AOD cases are due to severe trauma like car crashes, though King's case was likely due to the combination of her fall in high school and her hEDS, the joint weakening condition she also suffers from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AOD itself is rare, accounting for just one percent of all cervical spine injuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, King is fused from her skull to her pelvis and can't bend, twist or slouch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she is slowly regaining her ability to get back to hobbies she had before that fateful fall 20 years ago. This includes a recent bowling outing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I didn’t plan on playing. I was just there to watch friends. But something in me said, "Why not try?"' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I bowled a strike—on my very first try. My friends screamed and clapped and cheered like wild.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microplastics are in our food, and while you cannot completely avoid them, you can reduce your exposure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microplastics enter our food through contaminated water or soil or through plastic food packaging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To reduce exposure, you should minimize food contact with plastic surfaces, pass on plastic water bottles and avoid microwaving food in plastic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Microplastics have infiltrated virtually every ecosystem—from the ocean depths to the arctic tundra. But in 2024, scientists in New Mexico started looking closer to home: 52 autopsy samples from human brains. The results proved that no part of the body is immune. Not only were the microplastics accumulating in the brains—even able to pass the blood-brain barrier—but the samples from 2024 had higher concentrations compared to 2016.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These tiny plastic particles are remnants of the world’s massive plastic supply, and so far, it’s unclear what their buildup in our bodies means for our health. However, I spoke to the experts, and while there’s no way to completely avoid microplastics, it turns out that there are ways to limit your exposure—especially when it comes to food.   
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-where-microplastics-come-from"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Where Microplastics Come From &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Microplastics are tiny plastic particles—fragments less than 5 millimeters in diameter.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Some of the particles are manufactured to be so small, like the minuscule pellets that make up the plastic bottle your favorite soda comes in. Other microplastics are created when larger plastics—like those used in tires, plastic food containers or clothes made of nylon and polyester—break down.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The majority of plastic waste is left to accumulate in landfills and the environment, an FDA official from the Human Foods Program told &lt;em&gt;EatingWell&lt;/em&gt; in an interview. “Most plastics do not biodegrade and instead break down from weathering in the environment over time into microplastics,” they said. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; From the landfill, microplastics infiltrate the groundwater.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Or they can be carried by wind and rain into other water supplies and farmland. Sewage sludge, a byproduct of waste management that’s commonly used as fertilizer for croplands, forests, parks, golf courses and lawns, also contains a high concentration of microplastics.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some of the food we eat also contains microplastics. “It's coming from two sources: The environment—if the water or soil is contaminated with microplastics, they get into food—or it’s coming from the plastic containers and packaging,” said &lt;a href="https://www.umass.edu/food-science/about/directory/lili-he" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lili He, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, analytical chemist and head of the Department of Food Science at University of Massachusetts Amherst. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A study reported that nearly 90% of samples from 16 different proteins contained microplastics, with significantly more particles found in highly processed proteins.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The average number of microplastic particles was highest in seafood, followed by plant-based proteins like plant-based nuggets and tofu blocks and then terrestrial meat like chicken and beef. Chicken breast measured the least contamination with an average of two microplastic particles per serving compared to the highest, breaded shrimp, with 370.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Microwaving may also increase your microplastic consumption. One study looked at six commonly used plastic containers and found that polypropylene containers—like those used in delis or for takeout—transfer the most microplastics into food. And microwaving food in these containers increased microplastic transfer by threefold.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-are-microplastics-dangerous"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Are Microplastics Dangerous? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Microplastics appear to be just as ubiquitous in the human body as they are in the environment. Studies have found them in human urine, stool, blood, breast milk and organs. But is this buildup in our bodies dangerous? “Unfortunately, we cannot give a definite answer,” He said. There’s not enough evidence to directly link microplastics to a disease. Early data, however, suggests that the tiny plastic pieces aren’t beneficial. These early studies show that microplastics can potentially have an effect on the following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammation.&lt;/strong&gt; “There are studies showing microplastics can cause inflammation in a cell,” He said. A 2023 study showed microplastics taken from the ocean stimulate pro-inflammatory protein complexes in human mouth cells.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is concerning as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; is a driver of several disease processes, including diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders and chronic lung conditions like COPD. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digestion.&lt;/strong&gt; Another study reported that microplastics in the gut can interrupt digestion and cause dysbiosis—an imbalance of beneficial and harmful bacteria.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This imbalance can foster pathogenic bacteria and prevent the gut from properly absorbing nutrients as it should, He said. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heavy metal intake:&lt;/strong&gt; Research also suggests that microplastics can act like a magnet for heavy metals, like arsenic, concentrating them and then carrying them into the food supply or our bodies.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; He adds that it can do the same thing with chemical pollutants like PFAS or pathogenic bacteria, making microplastics a food safety risk. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancer rates.&lt;/strong&gt; Some experts speculate that ingested microplastics could have a hand in rising cancer rates. A group of New Zealand researchers suggested that microplastics could be linked to the global rise in colon cancer among patients under 50.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The microplastics, they said, could damage the colon’s mucosal layer and decrease its protective effect, making a person more vulnerable to cancer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dementia.&lt;/strong&gt; In a recent study, researchers also made a connection to dementia.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Not only did the authors report significant microplastic concentrations in human brains, but they found that microplastic accumulation was even greater in the subgroup of brains that had been diagnosed with dementia.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-reducing-your-exposure-to-microplastics"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Reducing Your Exposure to Microplastics &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no way to completely avoid microplastics. The good news is that there are steps you can take to reduce your exposure—especially in your food. He says that one of the most effective ways to do this is by minimizing the number of plastic surfaces your food touches. Here’s how: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opt for glass blenders and food processors.&lt;/strong&gt; When it’s time to replace your plastic blender or food processor, look for one with a thick glass pitcher. One study found that a plastic blender released billions of microplastic particles into juice after just 30 seconds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ditch plastic water bottles.&lt;/strong&gt; Investing in a non-plastic reusable water bottle is an easy—and cost-effective—way to cut down on your exposure to microplastics. A single liter of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/nanoplastics-in-bottled-water-new-study-8425973" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bottled water&lt;/a&gt; can house 100,000 microplastic particles.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be wary of tea bags.&lt;/strong&gt; When exposed to hot water, food-grade nylon (the material used to make many tea bags) has been found to release seven times more microplastic particles than single-use plastic cups.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Look for tea bags made from non-plastic materials, like plant-based hemp or opt for loose-leaf tea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use non-plastic cutting boards.&lt;/strong&gt; Using a plastic cutting board is a surefire way to introduce microplastics into your food.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Instead, opt for a wooden or metal one. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid putting plastic food containers in the microwave.&lt;/strong&gt; While some plastics are safer than others for food storage, always transfer food into a glass or ceramic container before reheating.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use filtered water. &lt;/strong&gt;He also recommends filtering your tap water. One study found that microfiltration devices do the best job, removing 78% to 100% of microplastics from drinking water.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring reusable produce bags to the store.&lt;/strong&gt; While you may already bring reusable grocery bags to the supermarket, it’s also worth investing in a set of cloth produce bags for loose fruits and vegetables. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another area of caution is for seafood lovers. He recommends being mindful of which parts of the animal you’re eating. Bivalves like clams and mussels may contain more microplastics since you eat the entire body—including its digestive system—versus eating a piece of fish. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Microplastics are everywhere. While it’s too soon to definitively say what the health effects are, it’s clear that these tiny plastics are accumulating in our bodies. The good news, if you want to minimize your microplastic consumption, is that there are actionable steps to do so. Start by swapping out plastic containers and tools for glass or steel, skip the bottled water and don’t put plastic in the microwave.

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s been no data showing which foods are most likely to contain microplastics. But studies do show:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bottled water contains lots of microplastics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Highly processed proteins contain significantly more microplastics than minimally processed proteins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seafood commonly contains microplastics (one study showed microplastics in 99% of samples).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microplastics have also been detected in a host of other foods including beer, honey, salt, milk and fruit, among others. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            But his &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/08/health/measles-outbreak-urban-areas/index.html"&gt;recent push&lt;/a&gt; for people to get vaccinated for measles stands in stark contrast to Kennedy’s years of work against measles vaccines, including suing the state of New York for its vaccine mandates, and making numerous claims that the shot is dangerous and unnecessary.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi00033b6otdssjch7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy’s &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414" target="_blank"&gt;comments on X&lt;/a&gt; last Sunday that the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, “is the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles” set off vaccine critics who saw the statement as a betrayal of the health secretary’s longtime views on vaccine safety.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi00043b6ov1zbi0cu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Bobby Kennedy was our founder, but Bobby Kennedy is now the Secretary of HHS,” Mary Holland, CEO of the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense, said in a video statement. “He certainly left off that in my personal experience, and in the personal experience of many people at CHD, the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine was extremely injurious.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi00053b6oenstuw38@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Holland went on to repeat disproven claims that the MMR vaccine causes autism.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi00063b6o2lgu5iiw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The health secretary followed up this Thursday with a Fox News interview, where he told host Martha MacCallum that it is “very hard to tell” whether measles deaths this year could have been averted with vaccinations. “We need to do better at treating kids who have this disease, and not just saying the only answer is vaccination.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi00073b6onnjx5zvm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He also discussed the health agency’s &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/10/health/kennedy-autism-causes/index.html"&gt;“massive research and testing” plan&lt;/a&gt; to find the causes of autism by this September, a project he said will probe vaccinations along with environmental exposures, food and societal factors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi00083b6ovd7ren4j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While Kennedy has been most critical of Covid-19 vaccines in recent years, MMR immunizations have been one of his earliest and most consistent targets for misinformation and alarm&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;over the last two decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi00093b6olujpgkws@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            CNN reached out to HHS for comment regarding Kennedy’s past and recent remarks on MMR vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000a3b6ow0d05k65@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As Kennedy wrote in his 2023 book with Brian Hooker, Vax-Unvax, “The MMR vaccine is the tip of the spear regarding the modern debate around vaccine safety.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000b3b6o6sl8h55q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here are three ways Kennedy questioned the vaccine’s safety and the severity of measles infections themselves.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000d3b6oaygtqxye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The theory that MMR vaccines led to autism first took hold with a since-retracted 1998 study by Andrew Wakefield. As the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/05/24/autism.vaccine.doctor.banned/index.html"&gt;disbarred British physician&lt;/a&gt; rose to prominence in the anti-vaccine world, so did Kennedy — who repeatedly defended his debunked research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000e3b6osuqtuggd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Wakefield [and his co-researchers] did not state that MMR causes autism,” Kennedy and Hooker wrote in their 2023 book. “They merely pointed out the timing of the vaccine before the onset of symptoms.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000f3b6ospe7d9o7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ten of the 12 co-authors on the study &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(04)15715-2/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;issued a retraction&lt;/a&gt; in 2004, saying it established no causal link between the MMR shot and autism. Infants with autism typically start showing signs between 12-24 months of age; the first dose of the MMR vaccine is usually given when a child is 12 months old.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000g3b6of0agqx8j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy, like Wakefield, has asserted over the years that MMR vaccines lead to myriad adverse events besides autism.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000h3b6ofbapf1kn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            MMR vaccines have an “unconscionably high injury rate” Kennedy &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/robert-f-kennedy-jr-s-response-to-the-message-of-measles-what-the-new-yorker-wouldnt-publish/" target="_blank"&gt;wrote on CHD’s website&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, citing gastrointestinal and respiratory complications from a mid-1970s study. Those are symptoms “that might persuade rational consumers to choose the infections over the vaccine,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000i3b6ojn60p8fz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This March, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112" target="_blank"&gt;speaking to Fox News’ Sean Hannity&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy repeated the claim that the vaccines themselves are as risky at the virus. “[The MMR vaccine] causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes,” and leads to “deaths every year,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000j3b6ouswa0bu3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are no reported deaths from the vaccine among healthy people, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/public-health/measles/know-the-facts/" target="_blank"&gt;Infectious Disease Society of America&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000l3b6of4scso2j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy has repeatedly said that measles outbreaks are not unusual, infection is not severe in healthy people, and deaths with measles are due to other causes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000m3b6oqsjfvqvg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you look at the kids in Africa who die from measles, or these other infectious diseases, they’re all malnourished,” he said on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LJXPOv4SM" target="_blank"&gt;Joe Rogan’s podcast&lt;/a&gt; in June 2023. “It’s hard for a disease to kill a healthy person; it’s hard for an infectious disease to kill a healthy person with a rugged immune system.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000n3b6ogdxquuxu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            State health departments reported &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;no underlying health conditions&lt;/a&gt; reported in the three US deaths this year, the first measles deaths in the country in a decade. All three, two children in Texas and an adult in New Mexico, were unvaccinated. In the Fox interview Thursday, Kennedy suggested at least one of the children had prior medical complications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000o3b6ogfcz2qxs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy also this year dismissed the notion that many died from measles in a 2019 Samoan outbreak that killed 83 and infected more than 5,000 people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000p3b6oldodpf5l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Details of Kennedy’s &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/15/politics/video/rfk-jr-vaccine-measles-outbreak-samoa-digvid"&gt;visit to Samoa&lt;/a&gt; months before the 2019 outbreak resurfaced during his Senate confirmation hearings. He went to the country &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/lsamoa-medical-freedom-hero-court-case-dismissed/" target="_blank"&gt;following an invitation&lt;/a&gt; from an anti-vaccine advocate, but denies he campaigned against vaccination while he was there. He also denied to senators that dozens of people died from the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000q3b6o0d2i3lmy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most of the people did not have measles,” when tissue samples were tested, he told Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) “We don’t know what was killing them.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000r3b6o07t9q5ea@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That claim is a “total fabrication,” Samoa Director-General of Health Dr. Alec Ekeroma told &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-jr-samoa-measles-kennedy-vaccines-pacific-42a9cb583c71f165699b16710884c474" target="_blank"&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;. Ekeroma also said Kennedy met with anti-vaccine advocates while there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000t3b6o7zydky14@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy, along with former federal prosecutor Michael Sussman, sued the state of New York in 2019 to oppose vaccine requirement for school-age children. The state’s legislature passed the law, which removed religious exemptions, amid a measles outbreak that year among Brooklyn’s Orthodox Jewish community that infected nearly 800 people.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000u3b6o9nuzf1os@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A state Supreme Court justice rejected the suit days later. The Kennedy-chaired Children’s Health Defense vowed to keep fighting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000v3b6oe086z78i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That same year, Kennedy rallied with Washington state residents against a MMR vaccine mandate for children attending school. At the time, there were roughly 50 reported measles cases in the state. It spread to 71 people, most of them unvaccinated children, during the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6819a5.htm" target="_blank"&gt;monthslong outbreak&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000w3b6oder5mnch@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As health secretary, Kennedy has maintained that position that vaccination should be a choice despite the spread of measles across 23 states.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000x3b6omwegd64z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The federal government’s position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine, but the government should not be mandating those,” Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/08/health/measles-outbreak-urban-areas/index.html"&gt;told CBS News&lt;/a&gt; April 8. “I always said during my campaign — and every part, every public statement I’ve made — I’m not gonna take people’s vaccines away from them. What I’m gonna do is make sure that we have good science so that people can make an informed choice.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

This time, there was no talk of the vaccine that prevents measles deaths - unlike many of his long days since the outbreak began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The focus was on their healing," Mr Holbrooks said. "You never want to see anybody pass away, especially a child that young, from any kind of illness, because there is a prevention for it - the MMR vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Like other Seminole natives, Mr Holbrooks was not vaccinated against measles as a child. He got a shot in college, and another in February, when his hometown became the epicentre of one of the country's worst measles outbreaks in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The US has seen more than 700 cases this year. The majority of infections - 541 as of Friday - occurred in western Texas, with 56 patients sent to the hospital. Cases in New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas also are linked to the outbreak. Two children, including Daisy, have died - the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2nzyjgrwxo" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;first recorded fatalities from measles in the US since 2015.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It's not slowing down either, public health experts say. They try to reach vaccine-hesitant residents, but struggle with those who carry on with daily life as usual and with mixed messaging from federal officials, including Kennedy who has endorsed immunization conspiracy theories in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I wish there were more coming in to get the vaccine," Mr Holbrooks said. "We can put messaging out, but it's up to them to come see us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;The South Plains public health director, Zach Holbrooks, is trying to reach vaccine-hesitant communities through messaging and public advertisements&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'Going about' life in a measles epicentre&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The western Texas town of Seminole - population 7,000 - is bordered by miles of rural farmland and oil fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Among billboards for restaurants, gun silencers and tractors, a digital sign hints at the crisis gripping the community: a warning about the dangers of measles, which can cause complications including pneumonia, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It has spread rapidly among Mennonites, a religious community living near Seminole. Mr Holbrooks estimates the population could be as many as 40,000 across several counties. In those areas, public school vaccination rates are as low as 82%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Roughly 95% of a community must be vaccinated against the measles to achieve herd immunity, when enough of a group is immune to a disease that its spread is limited and the unvaccinated are protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr Holbrooks remembers when the Low German Mennonite group began immigrating to his hometown and nearby states in the 1970s. The religion has no specific doctrines against vaccinations, but they tend to avoid many modern aspects of life, including the health care system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Their community is not alone. At least 118,000 kindergartners in Texas are exempt from one or more vaccines, mostly in rural areas, said Terri Burke, director of Texas vaccine advocacy group, the Immunization Partnership. Parents can get a waiver to exempt their child from school vaccine requirements for a variety of reasons, including religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Savannah Knelsen, an 18-year-old server at a Seminole barbecue restaurant, has not been vaccinated against measles - or anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Like many in Seminole, Jessica Giesbrecht (left) and Savannah Knelsen (right) have opposing views on vaccination &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Many of her family members and friends - also unvaccinated - caught the measles in recent weeks. One relative developed a fever of 104.5 F (40.2 C), but still chose not to go to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The recent deaths of two children have not convinced her to get vaccinated, she said, adding that she was healthy and wanted to let her body "fight off" infections. Experts agree the vaccine is the best way to prevent infections - including severe ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ms Knelsen's 19-year-old co-worker, Jessica Giesbrecht, along with her family, has been vaccinated against the measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I'm worried for my baby niece," Ms Giesbrecht said, adding she was too young to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Still, the two said the outbreak doesn't weigh heavily on daily life. Others in Seminole agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A cashier at a local pharmacy said no one has stopped by for measles vaccinations since the outbreak started. "People are just going about their lives," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Texas has had over 500 cases of measles, most concentrated in rural western counties &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Kennedy tries to 'cover middle ground'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;On Sunday, Kennedy made his first trip to the region since the outbreak to attend the 8-year-old girl's funeral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The top US health official is an unlikely figure to spearhead the fight against measles - he has in the past endorsed conspiracy theories about immunizations, including debunked claims about links to autism. He downplayed the outbreak in western Texas at first, calling it "not unusual".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Trump echoed these remarks last weekend, saying that only a "fairly small number of people" had been impacted, when he was asked by the BBC about the outbreak aboard Air Force One. It was "not something new", he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;On Wednesday, Kennedy gave his strongest statement yet in support of the measles vaccine, telling the BBC's US partner CBS News, "The federal government's position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The remarks were met with social media backlash from some anti-vaccine supporters. Kennedy added, however, that the government "should not be mandating" vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The influence of some of his earlier remarks lingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In one of several Mennonite-owned natural-health stores in Seminole, dozens of bottles of cod liver oil - a supplement that contains vitamin A - are on display. Alongside the vaccine, Kennedy has promoted vitamin A as an alternative measles treatment, a remedy doctors say should not be given without guidance from a physician and is no substitute for the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Vitamin A is sometimes used to help treat measles - but should not be given without a physician's guidance&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The treatment has at times proven dangerous. Covenant Children's Hospital in nearby Lubbock told the BBC it has treated several unvaccinated children with measles for vitamin A toxicity - some had used it a preventative measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The community needs federal officials to provide stronger messaging to help convince people to get vaccinated and slow the outbreak, said Gordon Mattimoe, director of the health department in nearby Andrews County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"People look to their leaders to lead," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Jeff Hutt, a former spokesperson for the Make America Healthy Again political action committee and Kennedy's former national field director, argued that the health secretary had to "cover the middle ground", providing statements that are "politically adequate" while also providing sceptical stances on vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"In covering the middle ground, I'm not necessarily sure he was able to reassure folks that he had a handle on [measles], or that he was able to reassure folks that he was sticking to his guns," Mr Hutt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Slashing funds in an outbreak zone&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The Trump administration's health policies could have other consequences in Texas, officials say. Local health departments are at risk of losing critical resources because of attempts to cut $11.4b (£8.8) in public health grants. The move was temporarily blocked by a judge last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr Mattimoe said that because of the potential cuts - around $250,000 in grant funding for his health department - he is not able to hire a new nurse to give immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In a statement to the BBC, the US Department of Health and Human Services said it deployed the "necessary" resources from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to respond to the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The CDC is in close, constant communication with local and state health officials on the ground to ensure they have what they need," the official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The Texas Department of Health Services could lose as much as $550m in grant funding. It has provided staff, vaccines, testing and other support to local health departments, but likely will need extra funding, said spokesperson Chris Van Deusen told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr Mattimoe contacted lawmakers and the state for help, but is not hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I don't think they have the funds," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'Trusted messengers'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Local officials have seen some success in measles vaccination clinics, but hope even more will get vaccinated&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In nearby Lubbock, Texas, just two days after the news of Daisy's death, all was quiet at the health department's vaccination clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Other days have been busier, with as many as 20 people coming in for vaccines, said Katherine Wells, director of public health for the city, where hospitals receive children with severe measles cases from more rural counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Since the outbreak began in January, the city of Seminole has vaccinated 103 adults and 143 children against the measles, Mr Holbrooks said. The neighbouring three rural counties decided to close their underused vaccine clinics and send more staff to hard-hit Seminole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"There's always talk on, what else can we do, and are we doing enough?" Mr Holbrooks said. "We want to build trust, not tear it down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At times, local health officials have seen progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A Mennonite doctor in Andrews County gained community members' trust and encouraged them to get vaccinated, said Mr Mattimoe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Those trusted messengers in those communities - I think that's very important," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ms Wells hopes vaccinations will start to pick up after the latest measles death and the city's new guidance to vaccinate children as young as six months, instead of one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The bigger city saw an outbreak at a daycare among children too young to be fully vaccinated, a situation she believes will be helped by the earlier shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But, "there's always going to be some people that we don't reach", Ms Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;That means the virus is likely to circulate for a while in western Texas regions where people are unvaccinated, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We're just at the beginning of it," Mr Mattimoe said. "It's going to have to run through the community. Until they get that natural immunity, it'll just keep running its course."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 09:14:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9FSnhfaGh4MjJoRzdlRi1KZWZPNWJMeFFiSWdVNU1wRDE5cnUwRk9NbnVSRkRUa25yU1B6c0dGTnZOUHBhbHBWc2haMlVOSUg3RjN4ZjFYWFp3d9IBX0FVX3lxTE9vbnV1TWpVVEFNczJGd29lNTJ6cVBPVlVaUGFQUzM2WXFuT2RwblFFeHVRdko1amRxM1JMZkIwbGhzVmZGNzNhWlN6RDNSR3Y0VGRhWWZFVVFxSDB5eURj</guid></item><item><title>被诊断为不可逆的爆米花肺的少年：这是什么？症状，原因以及如何保持安全 - 印度时代 | Teenager diagnosed with irreversible Popcorn Lungs: What is it?

Brianne Cullen, a 17-year-old teen in Nevada recently called her mother from her cheerleading practice to inform her of her inability to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cullen was led to the hospital and diagnosed with bronchiolitis obliterans, also known as popcorn lung, from vaping in secret for three years. "It took a deadly diagnosis for her to stop," said Cullen's mom. She also revealed to The Daily Mail that Cullen began vaping at the age of 14 in order to handle the anxiety of returning to school after the long COVID-19 lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is popcorn lung?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

It is known so as it was first discovered in microwave popcorn plant workers who developed the disease from breathing in diacetyl, an artificial flavouring. However, to Cullen, the disease may have been caused by acetaldehyde found in the vape smoke, as per ALA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Popcorn lung causes shortness of breath, wheezing, fatigue and more. Cullen's mother pointed out that while her daughter's prognosis is good "because we caught it so early," it can also "cause problems like cancer in the future...popcorn lung is irreversible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of now, Cullen is using an inhaler to regulate her breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Should vaping products have stricter regulations to protect youth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How is popcorn lung caused?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bronchiolitis obliterans or popcorn is a serious and irreversible lung disease. It can be caused by the diacetyl found in many e-cigarette or vape flavours. It is usually added to complement flavours such as vanilla, maple, coconut and more. As per ALA, researchers at Harvard found that 39 of 51 e-cigarette brands contained diacetyl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happens in popcorn lung?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

As temperatures rise, many regions – especially the US, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/all.13758" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and Australia – are seeing seasonal allergies affect an &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/EHP173" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;increasing proportion of people&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.12755" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;over a longer season&lt;/a&gt; and with worse symptoms, say scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Pollen itself is an essential and ever-present part of our world. These microscopic particles pass between plants, enabling them to reproduce. While some plants spread their pollen with the help of insects, others rely on the wind, sending huge volumes of this powdery substance airborne. Many trees, grasses and weed species rely upon wind dispersal for their pollen. It is these that are especially likely to cause seasonal allergies, or hay fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This occurs when your immune system mistakenly identifies the pollen as a harmful substance, triggering a response normally reserved for pathogenic bacteria or viruses. Common symptoms can include a runny nose, itchy eyes and sneezing. In some cases, seasonal allergies can trigger breathing difficulties when inflammation in the airways leads to swelling, making it hard to get enough air into the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;Every time we cranked up the carbon dioxide, the ragweed responded.

The leading theory is that cold air downdrafts that occur during thunderstorm weather systems generate strong cross winds that blow at ground level, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ukhsa.blog.gov.uk/2022/03/18/thunderstorm-asthma-and-public-health-looking-back-to-move-forward/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;whipping up pollen grains and fungal spores from grass and plants&lt;/a&gt;. These then get carried high into the storm system by updrafts, where moisture in the clouds causes them to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cea.12709" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;swell and break apart into smaller fragments&lt;/a&gt;, massively increasing the number of allergen particles in the air. The strong electric field that develops during thunderstorms may also enhance the rupture of the pollen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Thankfully, major thunderstorm asthma events remain rare. But climate change is increasing people's risk of pollen exposure in other ways, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;For one thing, rising temperatures mean that pollen seasons – when plants emit pollen, typically during spring and summer – are starting earlier and lasting longer, says Elaine Fuertes, a public health scientist who focuses on the environment and allergic disease at the National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College, UK. "You're going to get people who experience symptoms earlier in the year, for a longer period of time," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In parts of the world, including the US and Europe, one of the key culprits is ragweed – a widespread group of flowering plants that many people consider to be weeds. There are various species of ragweed around the world but they can produce mind-bending amounts of pollen. A single plant is capable of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://allergyasthmanetwork.org/allergies/pollen-allergy/ragweed-allergy/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;emitting one billion pollen grains&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Ragweed grows in gardens and farmland but also in nooks and crannies in urban environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Allergies to ragweed pollen already &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://aafa.org/allergies/types-of-allergies/pollen-allergy/ragweed-pollen/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;affect some 50 million people in the US alone&lt;/a&gt;. A study analysing data from 11 locations in North America between 1995 to 2015 found that 10 of those locations experienced longer ragweed pollen seasons – sometimes much longer. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-ragweed-pollen-season" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;During that 20-year period&lt;/a&gt;, the season lengthened by 25 days in Winnipeg, Manitoba, 21 days in Fargo, North Dakota and 18 days in Minneapolis, Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The winter warms, the springs are starting earlier, and the falls are being delayed, and so the time that you spend outdoors in contact with allergic pollen is definitely going up," says Lewis Ziska, associate professor of environmental health science at Columbia University, in New York, US, and one of the scientists who researched the ragweed pollen season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;These changes get more drastic in northern parts of North America, Europe and Asia, Ziska says.

It is also that the amount of allergens in the air are increasing in many parts of the world. In the 2000s, the pollen season in the continental US started three days earlier than it did during the 1990s, but crucially, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/gcb.12755" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;the amount of pollen in the air was also 46% higher&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This is partly because carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere are rising, due to emissions from human activities. And many of the most bothersome plants for hay fever sufferers thrive on CO2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;When researchers &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111712" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;grew a certain type of grass&lt;/a&gt; under different CO2 levels, for example, they found that plants grown in an atmosphere containing CO2 at 800 parts per million (ppm) had flowers that produced about 50% more pollen than plants grown in air containing 400ppm. The latter mimics current levels of CO2 in Earth's atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ziska, who authored the 2022 book &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://cup.columbia.edu/book/greenhouse-planet/9780231206709" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Greenhouse Planet&lt;/a&gt;, ran similar experiments with ragweed. His results mirror those of other researchers. "Every time we cranked up the carbon dioxide, the ragweed plants responded. They grew more. They produced more pollen," he says.

While originally from North America, ragweed, for example, has &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.12156" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;spread across Europe&lt;/a&gt;, as well as into Australia, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-71318-0_8" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; and South America.

The remaining two-thirds is specifically due to climate change, including the lengthening of the growing season as temperatures warm. "So it'll be an earlier season, a longer season, as well as a more intense season for those who experience allergic symptoms – and then a higher risk of new sensitisation for a previously unexposed population," Fuertes says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Not every region in the world will see more pollen production. Some researchers have found that southern California, for example, will experience earlier &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/11/1461/2014/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;but less productive pollen seasons&lt;/a&gt;, largely as a result of reduced rainfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Relatively speaking, the amount of pollen in the air will still vary from year to year, Fuertes points out. But that may not be of much help to hay fever sufferers. "Once you're sensitised and go on to develop allergic symptoms, you'll still likely experience symptoms during years when pollen levels may be lower than average," she says. "You'll react to the pollen that's around."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;So, what can people do about this?

A century ago, some US cities even set up commissions to tackle ragweed. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1932/08/12/archives/chicago-employs-1350-in-hay-fever-fight-jobless-used-to-cut-down.html" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;"Chicago employs 1,350 in hay fever fight,"&lt;/a&gt; blares one headline from 1932. The news story explains that men – otherwise unemployed during the Great Depression – were paid the equivalent of one week's food and lodging (and "25 cents in cash") for each day they spent cutting down the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Planting of tree species that produce less allergy-inducing airborne pollen is one way cities can help sufferers (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Planting of tree species that produce less allergy-inducing airborne pollen is one way cities can help sufferers (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Other solutions lie in smarter urban design.

"We need to know what we're breathing in. That's a pretty fundamental thing in terms of our health," says Beggs, who points out that while most people take it for granted that they can get reliable, real-time, validated information on metrics like temperature or rainfall in their area, relatively few can say the same for airborne allergens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But even those services that are modelling pollen counts in an extensive, detailed way – &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03686-2" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;such as the Finnish Meteorological Institute&lt;/a&gt; – aren't monitoring or modelling airborne allergen levels, which are more accurate as each pollen grain can release different amounts of allergens and they can vary by the weather conditions. These are a different measurement, Fuertes points out, and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(23)01469-0/fulltext" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;one that she's shown is more closely linked to allergy symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. "Nobody is measuring allergen levels on a routine basis," Fuertes says. "We should be moving towards that."   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Overall, experts say, the science is clear. Without concrete, coordinated action, climate change will continue to make hay fever worse across many regions of the world. This might include more dramatic, deadly events like thunderstorm asthma. But it might also mean more people sniffling and suffering, for a longer season, every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We have the studies now to show that it's really having an impact on human health," says Beggs. "And there's more to come."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 09:01:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOTVNlbGtHQjZqYnVkaFNNY1dvMkNrWDhWQXRZNXRRWEVuTmRKbUNoWEZTOVFuY0MwaGZQRVJDZlAzMEgtM3E2dU1BUVJkUUhWdmJRY3dMaHdRZE1HUjBKQjB0LUFRUDZoQ1l0cDdGc0pKSFpfZG9vYWdPTXZ6S3k2d1RzZWFJMGtJd0dBektMaUs5Q0g5NkpFbFpYbmZmWElNM3VRTG4wc2U</guid></item><item><title>A Safer Opioid Alternative: New Drug Offers Pain Relief Without Dangerous Side Effects - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxQODlnMlZBTHk0OHhOeW9aTUYzWEtxUnl3MEtjT1NESy10RXM5cWhiTU1xUFhuVURjS3B3T1dxNjFHbjJNdV9YZGVGckNaYWFBTnJCSUdHWnFYeTZVdGdmQ3dpWEpoR2lwSUtiQ0pwNlBBdlNTdHZwRHlmbEhjLTR5QmdtWDlOT1oyUWVmWU9lNHBXXzV3VGZDUmRpNWxDd2RucFI0WVo5UHhud0lOckVhbA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 08:21:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxQODlnMlZBTHk0OHhOeW9aTUYzWEtxUnl3MEtjT1NESy10RXM5cWhiTU1xUFhuVURjS3B3T1dxNjFHbjJNdV9YZGVGckNaYWFBTnJCSUdHWnFYeTZVdGdmQ3dpWEpoR2lwSUtiQ0pwNlBBdlNTdHZwRHlmbEhjLTR5QmdtWDlOT1oyUWVmWU9lNHBXXzV3VGZDUmRpNWxDd2RucFI0WVo5UHhud0lOckVhbA</guid></item><item><title>尽管退出精制糖 - 印度快递，您的血糖水平很高 | Reasons your blood sugar level is high despite quitting refined sugar - The Indian Express</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve read a celebrity interview, heard a neighbour spill their diet secrets, or taken inspiration from a social media post and finally ditched refined sugar. But why, then, is your glucometer reading still skyrocketing? According to Edwina Raj, head of services – clinical nutrition &amp;amp; dietetics, Aster CMI Hospital, Bangaluru, your blood sugar levels can be high even after cutting out refined sugar for the following reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="ev-meter-content ie-premium-content-block"&gt;&lt;img class="lazyloading" decoding="async" src="https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/default-ie.jpg" data-lazy-type="lazyloading-image" data-src="https://data.indianexpress.com/election2019/track_1x1.jpg" data-lazy-src="https://data.indianexpress.com/election2019/track_1x1.jpg" alt=""&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. What kind of carbs do you consume?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, carbohydrates, even unrefined ones, can &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/what-happens-eat-foods-high-sugar-9362032/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;increase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/what-happens-eat-foods-high-sugar-9362032/" class=""&gt; glucose levels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. While healthier, foods such as whole grains and fruits can impact blood sugar if consumed in large quantities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="osv-ad-class"&gt;
					&lt;p class="ie-adtext"&gt;Story continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;p id="gpt_ad_IE_ROS_ATF_1X1" class="ad-slot"&gt;
					&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Archana Juneja, consultant, endocrinologist, Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital &lt;a rel="noamphtml" class="keywordtourl" href="https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/mumbai/"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt;, added that foods like white rice, bread, packaged cereals, fruit juices, and starchy vegetables contain hidden or high-glycemic carbohydrates that break down into glucose and spike blood sugar. “Jaggery and honey can also contribute to this issue,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-personalisation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex carbs are your best friend in this regard, she said, recommending using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) or a glucometer to track how your body reacts to different foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Are you stressed all the time?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, stress and lack of sleep can significantly affect insulin sensitivity, making it harder for the body to regulate &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/food-wine/quit-sugar-14-days-benefits-sumukhi-suresh-expert-9880677/" class=""&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; effectively. “Stress triggers the release of cortisol and adrenaline, hormones that raise blood sugar levels,” explained Dr Juneja.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="custom-caption"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="lazyloading size-full wp-image-9933922" src="https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/default-ie.jpg" data-lazy-type="lazyloading-image" data-src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/04/sugar.jpg" alt="sugar" data-srcset="https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sugar.jpg 1600w, https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sugar.jpg?resize=450,253 450w, https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sugar.jpg?resize=600,338 600w, https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sugar.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sugar.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sugar.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sugar.jpg?resize=150,83 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"&gt; Ditched sugar and shift to complex carbs (Source: Freepik)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Do you have health problems?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, underlying health conditions, such as insulin resistance or hormonal imbalances, may contribute to high blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="adboxtop adsizes"&gt;&lt;p class="ie-adtext"&gt;Story continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="gpt_ad_IE_ROS_ROTATE_1_300X250" class="ad-slot "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Juneja, in Type 2 Diabetes, your body may not respond well to insulin even if sugar intake is low. Alternatively, skipping or incorrectly timing your medication can lead to elevated levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alcohol consumption and obesity, defined as a BMI over 23 or a waist circumference greater than 80 cm in females and 90 cm in males, can also impair the body’s ability to respond to insulin effectively,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What to do now&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To combat these issues, Raj said it is essential to monitor carbohydrate intake and focus on portion control, ensuring that even healthy foods are consumed in moderation. Regular physical activity can enhance insulin sensitivity, helping to lower blood sugar levels. “Take your prescribed medication and insulin regularly and on time,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, managing stress through techniques such as mindfulness or yoga and prioritising adequate sleep can further support blood sugar regulation. “Aim for 7–8 hours of quality sleep every night, keep a routine sleep schedule, and avoid caffeine or screens before bed,” suggested Dr Juneja.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="adboxtop adsizes"&gt;&lt;p class="ie-adtext"&gt;Story continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="gpt_ad_IE_ROS_ROTATE_2_300X250" class="ad-slot "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts recommend consulting a doctor for personalised strategies tailored to individual health needs. They may recommend specific dietary adjustments or medications to help manage blood sugar levels more effectively. By addressing these factors holistically, better control over blood sugar levels is possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="id_newsletter_subscription" class="ev-meter-content" data-slug="express-sunday-eye" data-bottom="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;At 42, Dr. Darshan Shah was used to being stressed. As a successful surgeon based in Los Angeles, he had spent 20 years regularly working 12-hour days, starting at 6 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when his wife got pregnant with their first child in 2016, he realized he needed to make a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-lifestyle-changes-live-longer-healthy-habits-genes-study-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;change to be healthier&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I found myself in a state of poor health. I had developed an autoimmune disease, I was 50 pounds overweight, I had high blood pressure that could not be controlled with medication, I had high cholesterol, and lots of risk factors for an early death," Shah, 52, told Business Insider. "But my son had a long life ahead of him, and I wanted to be around for it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah took a year off from being a surgeon and began researching the science behind &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/8-simple-habits-add-decades-onto-to-your-life-research-2023-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;long-term health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;"I was able to completely turn my health around and completely come off 10 different prescription medications within a year. I lost 50 pounds, and my autoimmune disease completely disappeared," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His focus improved at work, too, and he found that he was &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-self-care-tips-2024-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;no longer tired&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, he "wanted to wake up every morning and jump out of bed to attack the day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah's transformation made him realize this was the type of medicine he wanted to practice — helping people &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/healthy-habits-fit-throughout-life-personal-trainer-2024-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;get and stay healthy&lt;/a&gt; rather than just addressing medical issues as they arise. In 2016, he founded Next Health, a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-clinic-owner-reversed-biological-age-daily-routine-2024-12" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;health optimization&lt;/a&gt; and longevity clinic with locations across the US and in Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Shah does experimental longevity treatments at his clinics, but he still thinks that getting the basics right, as he did, is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/things-longevity-scientist-centenarians-does-for-live-longer-2025-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;key for a long, healthy life&lt;/a&gt;. He told BI the lifestyle changes he made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="729f2fba-a604-4e30-b7b2-579dc5c2e013" data-toc-id="729f2fba-a604-4e30-b7b2-579dc5c2e013"&gt;Cutting out ultra-processed foods &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My nutrition was horrible. I was eating a lot of ultra-processed food, especially highly processed carbohydrates," Shah said, so he eliminated them from his diet.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

He goes to the gym every other day to do a routine that is 70% strength training using free weights, and 30% cardio, for which he runs on a treadmill — plus some stretching to warm up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah also tries to get up and move every 45 minutes when he's at work to break up periods of sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They say that sitting is the new smoking, and I think that's true," Shah said. "As a surgeon, you spend a lot of time either standing or sitting in one position, and that sedentary non-movement leads to a high risk of disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While research shows that sitting for longer than 10 hours a day is associated with a higher risk of dying early, a 2023 &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/57/22/1457" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of about 12,000 people over the age of 50, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, suggests a solution.

According to Cleveland Clinic, eating a healthy diet, exercising, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding excessive alcohol and drug use can help to keep testosterone levels normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As BI previously reported, once considered taboo, growing numbers of men are doing &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/young-men-testosterone-therapy-masculine-ideal-2024-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;testosterone replacement therapy&lt;/a&gt; without an official diagnosis of "low testosterone," to help them build muscle, get erections, and have more energy. However, it's unclear whether it is beneficial for young, healthy men, and side effects can include acne, hair loss, and infertility.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Human biology is very much like that of other mammals, and yet so very different in areas where it matters. One of these being human neurology, with aspects like the human brain and the somatosensory pathways (i.e. touch etc.) being not only hard to study in non-human animal analogs, but also (genetically) different enough that a human test subject is required. Over the past years the use of human organoids have come into use, which are (parts of) organs grown from human pluripotent stem cells and thus allow for ethical human experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For studying aspects like the somatosensory pathways, multiple of such organoids must be combined, with recently [Ji-il Kim] et al. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08808-3" target="_blank"&gt;as published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; demonstrating the creation of a so-called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembloid" target="_blank"&gt;assembloid&lt;/a&gt;. This four-part assembloid contains somatosensory, spinal, thalamic and cortical organoids, covering the entirety of such a pathway from e.g. one’s skin to the brain’s cortex where the sensory information is received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such assembloids are – much like organoids – extremely useful for not only studying biological and biochemical processes, but also to research diseases and disorders, including tactile deficits as previously studied in mouse models by e.g. &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(16)30584-0?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867416305840%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank"&gt;[Lauren L. Orefice] et al.&lt;/a&gt; caused by certain genetic mutations in &lt;em&gt;Mecp2 &lt;/em&gt;and other genes, as well as genes like &lt;em&gt;SCN9A&lt;/em&gt; that can cause clinical absence of pain perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using these assembloids the development of these pathways can be studied in great detail and therapies developed and tested.&lt;/p&gt;
	            &lt;/div&gt;

                                        After one year in operation, the Strickland Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation Clinic at Evans Memorial Hospital in Claxton has yielded measurable improvements in health and quality of life for patients who have experienced events such as heart attacks or been diagnosed with heart disease or trouble breathing, reports the hospital and CareSource Georgia.
The clinic is also showing promise as a part of the rural hospital's ongoing efforts to remain viable and relevant to its community, said Evans Memorial CEO Bill Lee. CareSource Georgia, a nonprofit managed care plan health insurance provider, contributed $25,000 toward creation of the Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation Clinic. Another $25,000 contribution came from the Strickland Foundation, a longtime EMH benefactor organization created by the late George W. "Jack" Strickland Jr. and his estate. Not to be confused with the longer-established Jack Strickland Rehabilitation &amp;amp; Wellness Center across the street, the clinic was set up inside a recently underused space, which once housed nuclear-medicine equipment, inside the main hospital.

Another part comes from their nutrient-packed profile, which seems to support a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eight-healthy-lifestyle-habits-could-extend-your-life-by-decades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthy lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their popularity has led researchers to look deeper into what happens when these fruits are made a daily habit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After investigating different dietary approaches, a notable study gained attention for its focus on the potential of one avocado per day to enhance overall diet quality and encourage healthier eating patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eating-avocados-the-study"&gt;Eating avocados – the study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associate Professor Kristina Petersen and retired Professor Penny Kris-Etherton from Penn State University’s &lt;a href="https://hhd.psu.edu/nutrition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Department of Nutritional Sciences&lt;/a&gt; led an effort that put a spotlight on how a single daily avocado could affect everyday food choices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their work provides a window into how simple additions to meals might improve nutritional habits without major overhauls to what people eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their publication in the journal &lt;em&gt;Current Developments in Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; examined how a straightforward intervention could lead to better adherence to dietary guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes at a time when many are looking for ways to improve their health through small but meaningful changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-following-the-guidelines"&gt;Following the guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 1,008 adults participated in the investigation. Researchers gathered details about what everyone ate through telephone interviews that involved 24-hour dietary intake data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team tracked how closely each individual stuck to the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt; by using the Healthy Eating Index as a yardstick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were split into two groups over 26 weeks. One group continued with their existing patterns but limited avocados, while the other added one avocado daily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since only about 2% of American adults &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-fruit-can-protect-you-from-late-life-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;eat this fruit regularly&lt;/a&gt;, the project offered new information on how avocados might fit into many different diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-they-learned-about-eating-avocados"&gt;What they learned about eating avocados&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who enjoyed a daily avocado experienced a meaningful shift in their diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Avocados are a powerhouse of nutrition, and our objective was to ascertain if their regular consumption could boost diet quality,” explained Petersen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators noticed that this single change had an influence on how individuals approached meals, with greater emphasis on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-foods-with-these-key-nutrients-will-dramatically-slow-brain-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nutrient-rich items&lt;/a&gt; overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This improvement suggests that simple strategies like daily avocado consumption can significantly enhance diet quality,” said Petersen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also uncovered one more result that caught their attention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The substitution effect we observed is particularly noteworthy, as it demonstrates avocados’ potential in replacing higher-calorie, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/breaking-free-from-ultra-processed-foods-the-surprising-health-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;less nutritious foods&lt;/a&gt;,” Petersen added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-does-any-of-this-matter"&gt;Why does any of this matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By fostering better compliance with dietary guidelines, we can substantially lower the risk of chronic conditions and improve overall health outcomes,” said Petersen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings point to avocados as a practical avenue for people interested in following established nutrition recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By emphasizing basic, tasty items, this fruit may spark positive steps toward heart health, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/type-2-diabetes-heightens-alzheimers-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; management, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocados contain fiber and beneficial fats, which contribute to a satisfying feeling after a meal. That quality might support strategies that keep a person on track when planning or cooking dinner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each time they are used in place of sodium-heavy or refined-grain foods, the odds of maintaining a balanced diet appear to increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eating-avocados-a-short-history"&gt;Eating avocados – a short history&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocados, known by the scientific name &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avocado" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Persea americana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, have a long history traced to Mexico and Central America. Indigenous peoples domesticated this fruit well over 10,000 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Spanish explorers arrived in the 16th century, they introduced avocados to Europe, setting the stage for their eventual spread around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name “avocado” comes from the Nahuatl word “ahuacatl.” The shape of the fruit may have inspired that original term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the origin, the popularity of this versatile item continues to climb, with new dishes popping up in cafes and restaurants everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nutritional-details"&gt;Nutritional details&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocados are recognized for their monounsaturated fats, which may help reduce bad cholesterol levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can be good news for heart health, especially when combined with a balanced approach to other foods. They also contain an impressive amount of potassium, which supports &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/relaxation-techniques-can-lower-high-blood-pressure-at-least-temporarily/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood pressure regulation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people notice how avocados fit into a weight-management plan. They are known to help individuals feel satisfied, so there is less temptation to grab a snack soon after a meal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of fiber helps maintain a steady flow through the digestive system, possibly providing an extra advantage for everyday wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sustainability-considerations"&gt;Sustainability considerations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some regions face pressure to keep up with the rising demand for this fruit. Farms require a fair amount of water, and shipping them long distances can raise concerns about &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/biotic-homogenization-human-impacts-diminish-biodiversity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ecological footprints&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making choices that align with sustainable sources is one way to reduce any negative impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Producers have started exploring new farming methods to preserve soil and use resources more efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awareness of these efforts can be beneficial for those who want to enjoy avocados while showing respect for the environment at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-we-ve-learned-about-eating-avocados"&gt;What we’ve learned about eating avocados&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Penn State findings shine a spotlight on how a modest change might be enough to elevate meal quality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though these results are encouraging, continued exploration may uncover additional food-based strategies that fit different lifestyles or dietary needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small steps hold promise for those seeking to improve their daily habits. A simple addition in the kitchen can open the door to better eating patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocados have stood out as a delicious candidate that suits many palates, which makes it easier to stick with a plan over the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2475299124000052" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Current Developments in Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 00:06:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxPRXJqWXZ3N3VnUzgwODdGdEJUTld1SWNxSUNzQ09ScldVeXp3MkZkSHpaV3lzb0NXWC1PYzlkMHhzTUFpYUVEYnphNThsNzdkTXJEYmp3RFJRMFVKVU5NcTV5ZGFncHY2YktmV2FlRk5DanNLOXpWUkltbE02UjVVUWVUSTM5b3lpaTFXVW0xcHVUcEwwaVc1bldVaklKeXpNdDVRUA</guid></item><item><title>As a lifelong insomniac, can magnesium really help me sleep? - The Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFBVV95cUxNaDFnZFFNWFJvT0VKUTJsUlhKN1hyaVBEQkZqNWpjWkdxbTBhUm9iUDNsVWlKMjN0TlVCeXdZY1E3Y1BCLWJQdDljSDhleUViR1hUV0Q4TW9LcGxJMGxiYnZNNllrQVBHX2VLSE42a2FZRm51ekVnaE4yODFHWWxXOENhY21TODVtbWxZQnVwYTZIRkJ6MDc5Vi1oWFh3U1RGX29id3QwX1N2NHhMVFFIQkJMcmUwSEdINWhqMQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;As a lifelong insomniac, usually found staring at the ceiling at 3am at least three times a week, who has tried everything from prescription sleeping pills to herbal tea via hypnosis to nod off, magnesium was one of the few remedies I hadn’t explored, both because I wasn’t convinced by the evidence and because I am a&lt;span&gt; supplement sceptic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;My diet was already healthy, I reasoned, so why contribute to an unregulated supplement industry worth an estimated £138 billion worldwide? But desperate after a fretful night in February, I spent £12.95 on a two-month supply of magnesium citrate from a health food company on Amazon. Fast-forward seven weeks and, barring four occasions when I last recall looking at the clock at 1am, I have slept for six uninterrupted hours every night — by far the longest stretch of quality kip I have experienced in my entire adult life. I am as delighted as I am intrigued. Have I found a proven cure for my insomnia after all? Or swallowed the placebo effect of social media hype?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="2.1"&gt;&lt;div id="52d79fac-65de-4a97-b513-9ad8cc73b59d"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Lenny Kravitz, Gwyneth Paltrow and Taylor Swift are all magnesium fans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;LIA TOBY, DANIELE VENTURELLI, AXELLE/BAUER-GRIFFIN/GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;From heart health to nerve function: why magnesium is crucial to our health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Magnesium is a nutrient the body needs to stay healthy,” Dr Elise Dallas, a GP at the London General Practice, says. It is involved in more than 600 enzymatic reactions, including assisting nerve function, boosting heart health, supporting the immune system and repairing DNA. Most — 60 per cent — of our body’s magnesium is found in our bones, the rest in the muscles, the brain, soft tissues and fluids including blood. “Magnesium deficiency can increase the risk of developing several chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease, dementia and osteoporosis,” Dr Sophie Bostock, founder of the website The Sleep Scientist, who helped the NHS develop its clinically proven sleep improvement programme Sleepio, says. But it is its connection with sleep that interests her most. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;How does magnesium affect sleep? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Magnesium is believed to help sleep by regulating neurotransmitters, which help to “control how stress affects the body”, Bostock says. It assists the production of the “feelgood” neurotransmitter serotonin, activates gamma aminobutyric acid receptors that help to prevent overstimulation, reduces production of the stress hormone cortisol, encourages production of the hormone melatonin (which regulates our circadian rhythm) and helps to dilate our blood vessels so the body releases heat. “We need a temperature drop to fall asleep,” Dr Kat Lederle, a sleep specialist who is also at the London General Practice, explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Eat pumpkin seeds and dark chocolate for a magnesium-rich diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If you’re eating a healthy diet it should be easy to meet the NHS guidelines of 300mg magnesium a day for men and 270mg for women without a supplement. Good food sources include nuts, brown rice, fish, meat, dairy products, leafy green vegetables and dark chocolate. Magnesium is often added to breakfast cereals and is abundant in pumpkin seeds (a 28g serving contains 156mg). However, one 2018 study found that 48 per cent of American adults were deficient, and meeting guidelines doesn’t necessarily mean you’re getting enough of the mineral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/how-to-sleep-better-good-nights-sleep-lpw6vfskn" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to get a good night’s sleep — and the real reasons you’re not&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Age, exercise and alcohol can affect magnesium levels &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A true vitamin or mineral deficiency is when blood levels of a substance are low, Dallas says. In the 18 months she’s been running a menopause clinic at her practice, only one out of hundreds of women has tested as magnesium deficient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;However, Bostock says a blood test for deficiency is problematic because only a small amount of magnesium is stored in the blood, while the majority of magnesium is stored in our bones and tissues. Further complicating the issue of whether you may be deficient, she adds, is the fact that symptoms that could be attributed to magnesium deficiency,such as tiredness, irritability or anxiety, “can obviously have other causes”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;High salt, caffeine and alcohol consumption can impede our ability to retain magnesium, as can endurance exercise because we excrete magnesium through sweat and use more for muscle function. Last year, a systematic review in the Journal of Translational Medicine found that those who did intense exercise require 10 to 20 per cent more magnesium than sedentary people. Falling oestrogen levels during perimenopause, meanwhile, can reduce absorption, while stress has been found to “increase the rate of excretion of magnesium into the urine”, Bostock says. Dallas recommends that perimenopausal women and those who exercise a lot take a supplement. As a 46-year-old who works out every day and often feels stressed, I see why I might have been not getting enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Can a supplement really help? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The science is uncertain. One study of 46 adults found that taking a magnesium supplement a day for eight weeks improved total sleep time and sleep latency (the time it takes to fall asleep). Bostock points out, however, that “although [participants] fell asleep faster, they still took over an hour to fall asleep at the end of the trial. It wasn’t a miracle cure.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="2.17"&gt;&lt;div id="facad8fb-98b1-4d7b-9c5d-9430bdb23b18"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Magnesium is not a sleeping pill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A 2023 systematic review of 7,582 people found an observational association between magnesium intake and better sleep. “It can improve sleep efficiency, though evidence is still limited,” Dallas says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Lederle cites a 2021 review that found that taking a magnesium supplement helped people to fall asleep 17 minutes faster, but asks, “What’s the practical value?” In other words, whether our sleep will increase by enough to actively improve how rested we feel the next day has not yet been proved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/better-sleep-foods-to-eat-pr5x3npzz" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The food to eat for better sleep — and what’s keeping you awake&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Why are there so many different forms of magnesium?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Magnesium can’t be taken in pure form as a supplement — it is combined with another substance and the different types supposedly offer different benefits. They include magnesium orotate (magnesium bound with orotic acid), linked to improved heart health, and magnesium taurate (magnesium bound with taurine), which research has shown may promote healthy blood pressure. Magnesium citrate, bound with citric acid, and magnesium glycinate, which I have been taking — a compound of magnesium with glycine, an amino acid itself linked to improved sleep in animal studies — are among the most easily absorbed and are marketed to improve sleep, although no study has yet proved their efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The biggest buzz surrounds magnesium L-threonate — magnesium and L-threonic acid, a water-soluble substance derived from vitamin C — which the Stanford neuroscientist Dr Andrew Huberman has recommended for improved sleep, and which animal research suggests may be the best way of improving magnesium concentration in brain cells. “It’s the only form that effectively crosses the blood-brain barrier, offering superior brain bioavailability,” Dallas, who takes it herself, says. But Bostock says there is limited evidence that it improves sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Magnesium oxide (magnesium and oxygen) has been used in most trials to date and is by far the most budget friendly — I was excited to see an own-label Morrisons pack of 45 for £3 in my local supermarket. But it has been shown to be the least absorbent and is more commonly used to treat indigestion and constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Dallas suggests taking magnesium L-threonate, glycinate or citrate for sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/vitamin-d-b12-magnesium-how-much-per-day-v7qxxsq7r" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are you getting enough Vitamin D, B12 and magnesium?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Are more expensive supplements any better?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The difference in price typically varies according to brand rather than magnesium type and Dallas won’t speculate on why some are more expensive — but I’d wager an expensive marketing budget and celebrity ambassadors play a part. She does say that “expensive brands aren’t necessarily better”, but advises against cheap brands on Amazon “because you don’t know what’s in them”. My £12.95 Nobi Nutrition bottle from Amazon comes with a full list of ingredients, however, and has been third-party tested, which Dallas says to look for when choosing a supplement. Supplement dosage is measured in terms of the total weight of the magnesium compound, of which the element, or pure magnesium, is usually only a small percentage. The dose listed on a label will often sound high — mine is 400mg — but this is the total weight of the magnesium compound, in my case magnesium and glycine. The actual magnesium in each dose is usually much lower — in mine it’s 72mg, or 27 per cent of my recommended daily allowance. The amount absorbed will vary from person to person and “magnesium is a safe supplement”, Dallas adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Can a magnesium bath like Gwyneth’s work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;There’s little evidence that magnesium sprays and creams can improve sleep, and while Epsom salts, a compound of magnesium sulphate — which Paltrow bathes in every night to get “all the energy of the day off” — are well documented as a sleep ritual, a 2017 review found bathing in it carried no significant benefits. “Some studies show taking it transdermally might work,” Lederle says, but there is “not sufficient” evidence and “too many variables. Popping a pill, [at least] you know what’s gone in.” For those who don’t like swallowing a supplement, magnesium gummies might be a better option, which Lenny Kravitz describes as “like I’m just eating candy”. He told New York magazine that he takes Natural Vitality’s Calm Magnesium Citrate Anti-Stress Gummies (£21.66 for 120, &lt;a href="https://www.naturalvitality.com/en-gb/collections/gummies?_pos=5&amp;amp;_psq=ma&amp;amp;_ss=e&amp;amp;_v=1.0" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;naturalvitality.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Instant results? It’s probably the placebo effect&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Some supplement brands suggest we take magnesium before bed and I find this a comforting ritual. However, Lederle says, “it’s not a sleeping pill. You don’t take it and feel sleepy. It works by taking it on a regular basis to build levels.” Bostock adds that “it’s likely that a supplement will only help if you’re correcting a deficiency, and it could take a few weeks. I don’t think we have enough evidence to know whether it can have acute benefits in a day or two.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Bostock suspects the speed and extent of sleep improvement reported by magnesium fans on social media suggests the placebo effect is “a more likely driver”. As she says: “If you believe something will help you sleep, your anxiety about not being able to sleep reduces and you fall asleep faster, and stay asleep for longer.” Given that I have slept better from day one, I suspect my more restful nights are the result of a combination of placebo and a corrected deficiency. But I’ll keep on taking it, for as long as it works for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxNaDFnZFFNWFJvT0VKUTJsUlhKN1hyaVBEQkZqNWpjWkdxbTBhUm9iUDNsVWlKMjN0TlVCeXdZY1E3Y1BCLWJQdDljSDhleUViR1hUV0Q4TW9LcGxJMGxiYnZNNllrQVBHX2VLSE42a2FZRm51ekVnaE4yODFHWWxXOENhY21TODVtbWxZQnVwYTZIRkJ6MDc5Vi1oWFh3U1RGX29id3QwX1N2NHhMVFFIQkJMcmUwSEdINWhqMQ</guid></item><item><title>Nine ways to keep your brain healthy - The Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOVzA1U0h5RTNLcEtzMmxfZXQzSm5DLXJ5R1RkM0lZZVNBUDhhLUdUYlBXR2dIQUhQbFdXdkxmUTRUTzlzS3ZseDhfeFREOUJQeXpoY0VJNFE4MFVaYlhHWjRndlBRNnN3R0gzLTRKZGFqaXNnbjZIRWp5WVdDOUpzcFlhaFNSVW9PSkV5NGctREFhSTZfTG1oSnpaQzc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__ArticleContent-sc-15gvuj2-8 gJBkaT"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;&lt;span class="responsive__DropCap-sc-1pktst5-1 enuiNL"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;ow do we best keep our brains healthy? According to Dr Sabine Donnai, founder of the Viavi longevity clinic, it is the small things we do every day that make the biggest difference to our brain health, preventing cognitive decline over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In fact, the latest research suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/commissions/dementia-prevention-intervention-care" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;as many as 45 per cent of dementia cases could be delayed&lt;/a&gt; or prevented with help from some simple tweaks to our habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“We are looking at marginal gains from changing aspects of our diet and daily activity as well as incorporating new habits,” she says. “It is never too late to start making these changes.” Here’s what she recommends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;1. Eat a balanced diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Scientists from the University of Warwick, the University of Cambridge and&lt;span&gt; Fudan University in China who examined the food preferences of 181,990 UK adults with an average age of 70 found that people who ate a more balanced diet had better cognitive function and memory than those on a reduced-carb, high-protein or plant-based diet. Their findings, published in the journal Nature Mental Health, also showed the balanced eaters also had better “brain morphology”, defined as higher amounts of grey matter, the outermost layer of the brain, which is responsible for controlling movement, memory and emotions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;2. Exercise daily, even if it’s just a walk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;People who are physically active are 20 per cent less likely to develop dementia than those who aren’t, according to the Alzheimer’s Society. “It doesn’t matter how you stay active but a combination of different types of exercise is probably best,” Donnai says. A daily walk is the best place to start, with a 2022 Jama Network study of 78,430 adults living in the UK showing that covering a daily total of 9,800 steps was optimal for lowering the risk of dementia but that even 3,800 steps a day at a faster pace led to a lower incidence of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;3. Eat more berries (ideally organic)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A study from King’s College London and the University of Reading published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that eating a handful of blueberries daily for three months led to benefits including improved memory and brain function in a group of healthy men and women aged 65 to 80. Donnai says that all berries are a great addition to a brain-healthy diet but that we should try to buy organic whenever possible. Last year an analysis of government figures by the campaign group Pesticide Action Network UK (Pan UK) found unwanted traces of the “for ever chemicals” PFAs (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), which hang around in the body, to be present in 95 per cent of 120 samples of strawberries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;4. Have a serving of leafy greens daily&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A daily serving of leafy green veg, such as spinach, kale, cabbage and lettuce, is a must for a healthy brain diet. In a study of 960 older people with memory problems, a team from Rush University in Chicago and the Tufts Human Nutrition Research Centre in Boston found that those who ate one serving daily of leafy greens had rates of cognitive decline equivalent to them being 11 years younger cognitively than those who ate the least. Leafy green vegetables are a rich source of brain-friendly nutrients including folate, nitrate and lutein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/eat-more-protein-brain-depression-dementia-xc8btxjvh" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eat more protein: the new way to improve your brain function&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;5. Take regular saunas&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Researchers from Finland reporting in the journal Preventive Medicine Reports showed that those who visited a sauna at least 2-3 times a week had a 53 per cent lower risk of being diagnosed with dementia over the following two decades than non-sauna users. Donnai says that regular saunas might help to lower inflammation levels in the body, a known risk factor for cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;6. Eat more oily fish&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Fish is a source of essential omega-3 fatty acids such as EPA and DHA, key micronutrients that enhance and protect the brain. A study of healthy midlifers published by American researchers in the journal Neurology showed that those who ate a variety of fish and had higher concentrations of omega-3 fats in their bloodstream had better brain structure and cognitive health in their forties and fifties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;7. Drizzle olive oil on your meals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Drizzling olive oil on salads and pasta dishes is a good habit to get into,” Donnai says. It contains predominantly monounsaturated fatty acids including the potent oleic acid, which is known to reduce inflammation in the brain. A team of Harvard scientists reporting in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology revealed that a daily teaspoon of olive oil was associated with a 12 per cent reduced risk of death from all causes, but highlighted the fact that there was also a connection between olive oil consumption and fewer deaths from degenerative brain disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;8. Cut out ultra-processed foods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Researchers at the University of Liverpool and the University of Cambridge, reporting in the Journal of Neurology last year, concluded that a “high UPF consumption is associated with dementia”. A previous study involving 72,083 people from the UK Biobank cohort also found that those consuming more UPFs over ten years were at a greater risk of dementia. According to these researchers, highly processed diets tend to have low levels of nutrients, too much sugar and sodium, and may lead to inflammation, which can be bad for brain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/how-avoid-microplastics-brain-bottled-water-23fr6pl58" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Want to avoid microplastics in your brain? Here’s how you could&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;9. Protect your blood-brain barrier&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a semi-permeable membrane that acts as a filter to keep harmful substances such as toxins and chemicals away from the brain. The BBB works well when fully intact but can be easily weakened by inflammation, smoking, pollution, head injury and acute or long-term illness such as hypertension and diabetes, which can damage blood vessels, including those that make up the BBB. If the BBB becomes defective it can speed up the accumulation of amyloid-beta and tau proteins, accelerating cognitive decline. However, there are many things we can do to preserve it. “Simple steps such as avoiding chemicals and additives as much as you can in cosmetics, cleaning products and food are helpful,” Donnai says. “Exercising daily and reducing stress in your life are also key steps to take.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p

by mimicking&lt;/a&gt; two hormones called GLP-1 and GIP, resulting in appetite suppression, increased production of insulin, greater insulin sensitivity and a reduction in the rate at which food is emptied from the stomach. The medication is available for weight loss to some people on the NHS and it can also be bought privately with a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Scientists at Eli Lilly, the company that makes Mounjaro, along with academic researchers have released two analyses of data from a three-year trial known as Surmount-1, throwing fresh light on the medication’s longer-term use. One analysis looked at trajectories of weight loss, the second at rebound after initial weight reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The results, which are to be presented at the European Congress on &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/obesity" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt; in Málaga next month and have yet to be peer reviewed, are based on data from about 700 participants who took tirzepatide in three different dose regimens during the 176-week study.

The team said the final average body weight reductions for these groups were 9.2%, 20.2% and 30.8% respectively. Each group encompassed around a third of the participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“[The work] demonstrates that we can in some way predict total final weight loss from the speed of weight loss observed in the first months of treatment,” said Prof Luca Busetto, of the University of Padova in Italy, one of the scientists behind the first analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers said most of the participants maintained clinically meaningful weight reduction over the course of the study. This was supported by a second analysis that found that average time to the lowest weight reached was 22 months, at which point participants had lost 23.1% of their starting weight on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While some subsequently regained weight – despite continuing with the medication – participants had nonetheless lost 19.4% of their starting weight, on average, by the end of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team added that 70% of participants regained less than 5% of their starting weight after hitting their lowest point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Naveed Sattar, of the University of Glasgow, who was not involved in the trial, said the finding of different weight loss trajectories could help give an indication of how much weight an individual might expect to lose in the long term. “That might be able to guide the need for some individuals to consider newer therapies, which are more potent, in the future,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Simon Cork, of Anglia Ruskin University, said the other analysis demonstrated the long-term effectiveness of tirzepatide in maintaining weight loss, which would be of interest to health bodies “as the costs of treating obesity-related co-morbidities rise year on year”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cork also noted long-term effectiveness and safety studies for such drugs were now at odds with guidance, which limits their use to a maximum of two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The findings come as the Advertising Standards Authority announced that along with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the General Pharmaceutical Council, it had warned businesses that advertising prescription-only medications to the public was prohibited. This includes weight loss jabs such as Mounjaro, Wegovy and Saxenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Among other examples, the rules cover paid-for ads on social media “such as image or video ads on Facebook, Instagram and TikTok”, sponsored searches on Google or other search engines, and ads by influencers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A Guardian investigation &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/dec/26/experts-concern-promotions-weight-loss-jabs-uk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;previously revealed&lt;/a&gt; that weight-loss injections were being aggressively marketed to British consumers through often illegal promotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxQcnVZMHgtOWd1Q19wdkNhYURVendnM3p4X09oakF4dXQwaU1sUlBMSUFweUprUF96Ymx2eXdIVEZBUUlGRkRHbktXZW5FM2dEUDBvSTVPeWtOb0dmQXhvdWVtMGNsNHhRQWNCMENXZjZNcDFzcmFqSlFSM0ZrazJDZ2JzNzB1TWt4Y0x4SDVSUFZWMm1TRUY4eE50TUw1cFdfWEY3d3ZteDR6WHhlZ3ZZdm9yQzVyYWV3RDFoNkFadS0</guid></item><item><title>This Underrated Nutrient Could Help Lower Your Colon Cancer Risk by 30%, New Study Says - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE0yNU9yRm83X3oxdlZTVF9uV09qT0hZM2VXLXdka04xMGxwVThneEVzdlhBU0F1SGZOeDhSR3EtZVpsWDNsVGN0R3oxY2ZLc3RBZjROYTMzcFEzZm5JNHpaWms2X0s4Yzc1VUF5Y2tqamxXQnRSUkZR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-blockquote" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Moderate iron consumption may help lower your risk of colorectal cancers like colon cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Colorectal cancer is one of the three most diagnosed cancers in men and women.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating more plant-based iron may lower colon cancer risk by 30%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. It ranks as the third most diagnosed cancer in men and the second in women, with nearly 2 million new cases reported in 2020.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Specifically in Korea, colorectal cancer rates have been rising quickly, increasing by about 2.6% each year since 2019.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it is true that there are some factors that are out of our control when it comes to colon cancer risk, other factors, including smoking, drinking excess alcohol, lack of exercise and dietary choices, can be controlled. Recently, scientists have suggested that eating red and processed meats (like bacon) might increase the risk of colon cancer. One possible reason for that connection is the heme iron these foods contain. Heme iron is a type of iron found in animal-based foods, which is more easily absorbed by the body than non-heme iron found in plant-based sources. While there are benefits to leaning on heme iron, some researchers suggest they may contribute to harmful reactions in the body that increase cancer risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, research on the link between heme iron and colon cancer has shown mixed results, with some studies suggesting a higher risk in Western countries and others showing little to no risk, especially in Asian countries like Japan.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These findings highlight that the relationship may vary based on factors like gender, location and eating habits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To explore how different types of iron in the diet, such as iron from animal sources (heme iron) and plant sources (non-heme iron), are linked to the risk of colorectal cancer in a large group of healthy Koreans, researchers conducted a study evaluating this population, and the results were published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To evaluate the associations between total, heme, and non-heme iron intake and the risk of colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer in Koreans, researchers used data from The Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study’s Health Examinees cohort (KoGES HEXA), a long-term research project carried out in health centers and hospitals across Korea. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the beginning of the study, researchers assessed what the participants typically ate over the past year using detailed interviews and a food questionnaire. This questionnaire asked how often participants ate certain foods and how much they usually ate. The questionnaire included 106 common foods in the Korean diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers then calculated the iron content of these foods, measuring two types of dietary iron for each participant: heme iron, which comes from animal-based foods like meat and fish, and non-heme iron, found in plant-based foods and other sources. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cases of colorectal cancer in this study were identified using data from the Korea Central Cancer Registry, managed by the National Cancer Center of Korea. Additional data were collected about participants’ age, sex, smoking and drinking habits, education level, family history of colorectal cancer and any history of conditions like hypertension, diabetes or high cholesterol. Information on physical activity was also gathered through questionnaires, while height and weight were measured to calculate body mass index (BMI). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With all of this information, analyses were conducted to determine potential links. In total, 109,908 people (37,697 men and 71,401 women) were tracked for an average of 9.1 years, and their information was used for this analysis.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; During the study, 608 new cases of colorectal cancer (CRC) were diagnosed (299 in men and 309 in women). Researchers found that &lt;strong&gt;people who consumed moderate amounts of iron daily&lt;/strong&gt; had a noticeably lower risk of developing colorectal cancer compared to those who consumed the least amount of iron. For colon cancer specifically, moderate iron consumption also correlated to a lower risk. In this study, a moderate amount of iron was classified as 5.00–6.27 mg per day—that's about as much as you'd get in a serving of our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/279978/one-pot-lentils-rice-with-spinach/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;One-Pot Lentils &amp;amp; Rice with Spinach&lt;/a&gt;. (That's just a fraction of your recommended daily value, which varies depending on age and sex.)&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it came to heme iron consumption, the researchers didn’t see a noticeable effect on the risk of developing colorectal or colon cancer. But for non-heme iron consumption, the researchers found that people in the group with moderate non-heme iron intake had a lower risk of colorectal cancer compared to those with the lowest consumption. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Specifically, for those who consumed a moderate amount of non-heme iron: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;their risk of CRC was reduced by 25%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;their risk of colon cancer was reduced by 30%. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For the men in the moderate non-heme group, the effects were even more significant. Men who consumed a moderate amount of non-heme iron had a 32% lower risk of CRC and a 44% lower risk of colon cancer. Additionally, as non-heme iron intake increased, there was a noticeable trend of lower colon cancer risk for both sexes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s interesting to note that the benefits of iron, particularly non-heme iron (plant-based iron), don’t increase steadily with higher consumption. Instead, the most protective effects were seen in a moderate intake range in this study. The researchers propose that this might be because iron consumption in Korea is generally quite low. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To put things into perspective, the recommended daily amount of iron is 8 mg for adult men and women over 51, and 18 mg for adult women under 50.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But for the lowest consumption group in this study, some participants were only getting between 1 and 5 mg of iron per day, which is far below the recommended amount.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The authors highlight that having too little iron has been linked to a higher risk of certain cancers, and this may be why strong benefits were not seen among those with the lowest intake of this nutrient. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like all studies, this one has some limitations to be aware of. This study is observational, and observational studies often face challenges with confounding variables, like overall diet. Another limitation is that the researchers only measured dietary habits at the start of the study, so any changes in eating patterns over time weren’t taken into account. The study also neglected to collect information about any iron supplements that participants may have been taking.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hearing headlines linking eating red meat to cancer can be alarming. But this study underscores how understanding the nuanced results of studies can help make informed dietary choices without overhauling your eating habits entirely. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, while these findings don’t conclusively link heme iron intake to colon cancer risk, it’s worth being mindful of your overall diet. Many Americans consume more meat than the recommended amounts, which could lead to overconsumption of heme iron along with other factors like saturated fats and calories that may contribute to health concerns.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That doesn’t mean you need to cut out meat altogether—instead, focus on portion control and balancing your meals with plenty of plant-based foods, which are rich in other nutrients (like fiber—a nutrient that may be linked to a reduced risk of colorectal cancer).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whenever you think about making a change to your eating habits, it’s crucial to consider your whole diet rather than just one nutrient. This study highlights that moderate, diversified consumption of both heme and non-heme iron might offer protective benefits, particularly in populations where overall iron intake tends to be lower. Incorporating iron-rich plant-based foods like lentils, spinach and tofu can support a well-rounded diet while offering additional advantages, such as dietary fiber and phytonutrients. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Don’t overdo it with this mineral—too much may not be a good thing for your body. But by taking small, practical steps, you can build a diet that’s both enjoyable and supportive of your health goals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A recent study in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; sheds light on the nuanced relationship between iron intake and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, particularly in a Korean population. The findings underscore the importance of balance, as moderate iron consumption, both heme and non-heme, was associated with a reduced risk of CRC and colon cancer. This research emphasizes that dietary habits, cultural context, and baseline nutrient consumption levels play a vital role in interpreting study results and shaping dietary recommendations. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While the study highlights potential protective effects of moderate iron intake, it also reminds us of the dangers of both under- and over-consumption. These findings reinforce the value of a well-rounded diet that includes a mix of nutrient-dense foods, emphasizing plant-based sources of iron alongside moderate portions of animal-based options.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
