    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, the team is planning to test the vaccine in women with recurrent yeast infections, also known as recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC). It's thought to affect one in 10 women in their lifetime and cause at least three or more yeast infections every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently, treatment relies on just one class of drug, which increases the risk that the infection will develop resistance and be harder to treat. These drugs also cannot be used during pregnancy and do not prevent future infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Karen Norris, lead study author and professor of immunology and translational biomedicine in the UGA College of Veterinary Medicine, said: 'RVVC is not life-threatening, but it is miserable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is a huge need.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Norris noted that the findings of these clinical trials could inform future research relating to more vulnerable populations, such as transplant recipients and cancer patients, who are at risk of life-threatening fungi that cause pneumonia, sepsis and infections in the central nervous system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Norris said: 'I’ve had a physician say to me, "I have patients that I get through stem cell transplants for their cancer treatment, and then they get [the fungus] aspergillosis. I often don’t have adequate treatment for that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's where I believe this vaccine will do the most good: in people who are at high risk for highly dangerous, life-threatening infections.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team's research, published in June in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-025-01171-4.epdf?sharing_token=eSFdZiSvMMMpOoBogqwI7NRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PTjK0U_xzcb8G2-906pF8em6Zq3uUl41a9tMp_PWoQEzy4bK30EZIh5Ne-NgXScB49oHaqGwOPHN9yZL4Uva_XvYG_sII9mtaf8eMv0Iv_vJcHiW1e0quRQNONCkKbZBI%3D"&gt;NPJ Vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, tested the NXT-2 vaccine on female mice that had been infected with vulvovaginal candidiasis, or a vaginal yeast infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Candida albicans, which causes yeast infections, is pictured above (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vaccine works by triggering the production of antibodies that work against NXT-2, a protein that helps export RNA and proteins. The antibodies bind to the surface of fungal pathogens and destroy fungal cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One group of mice were given the real vaccine while the other group received a placebo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found 28 days after a single dose of the shot, vaccinated mice had 50 percent less fungi present in their vaginal fluid than mice who had the placebo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vaccinated mice also had 35 percent less inflammation in their vaginal tissue compared to the unvaccinated group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team's previous research found the vaccine also reduced levels of Pneumocystis and Aspergillus fungi. Pneumocystis leads to Pneumocystis pneumonia, which generally affects those with weakened immune systems and leads to shortness of breath, fever, fatigue, chest pain and dry cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Aspergillus causes the infection Aspergillosis, which can invade the lungs and sinuses and cause internal bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'These studies provide supportive evidence of broad efficacy of NXT-2 and support the rationale for its further development as a single, pan-fungal vaccine for local and systemic fungal infections.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They found the DNA of the bacteria Viridians streptococcal, which lives in the mouth and digestive tract, in more than 40 percent of plaque samples from both groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15110035/pancreatic-cancer-oral-bacteria-gum-disease.html"&gt;Naturally found in the mouths of most Americans&lt;/a&gt;, Viridians streptococcal bacteria is usually harmless in healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the participants, the bacteria was largely present as a biofilm, or community of organisms, embedded into the arterial walls, where it lays dormant and evades detection from the immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, in people who are immunocompromised or have chronic conditions, the organisms may escape the biofilm and lead to conditions like endocarditis, an infection of the inner lining of the heart that causes inflammation, damage to heart tissue and blockages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When infected tissue breaks off from a heart valve, it travels through the bloodstream and can lodge itself into the coronary artery, blocking blood flow and eventually leading to a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on the results, experts are urging Americans to maintain proper oral hygiene, including brushing and flossing teeth twice a day and staying current on dental check ups to reduce the amount of Viridians streptococcal in the mouth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers in Finland found a common bacteria found in the mouth could be linked to America's biggest killer, heart disease (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Pekka J Karhunen, study author and professor in the Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology at Tampere University in Finland, told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/heart-attacks-may-be-linked-to-bacterial-infections-study-finds#How-would-oral-bacteria-cause-a-heart-attack"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;: 'We aim to show that there is a biofilm consisting of many bacteria in the atherosclerotic plaques and we also study the possibility that calcification of the biofilm — which occurs in the surface of the teeth — might also be involved in the calcification of coronary arteries.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings come as nearly one in three Americans, 83million, have some form of cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, heart attack and stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health authorities expect by 2050, more than 60 percent of Americans will have some form of heart disease.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cardiovascular disease accounts for one in three - 1million - deaths in the US, making it the leading cause of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, published last month in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.125.041521#sec-1"&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;, looked at coronary plaque samples from 121 people who suffered a sudden cardiac death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average participant age was 63, and nearly three in four were men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants in this group also had an average body mass index (BMI) of 30, indicating obesity, one of the leading causes of heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also looked at an additional 96 people who had undergone an endarterectomy, a surgery to remove plaque from the inner lining of an artery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average participant age in this group was 69, and 72 percent were men. Their average BMI was 27, indicating they were overweight but not obese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Southern states are more at risk of high death rates from heart disease, the latest data from the CDC shows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found 66 percent of plaque samples from the deceased group contained bacteria and 58 percent from the surgery group had it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the most common bacteria in both groups was oral viridans group streptococci (Viridians streptococcal). It was found in 42 percent of deceased patients and 43 percent of those who had surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In normal, unclogged arteries, there was less bacteria.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Karhunen said: 'Oral viridans group Streptococci are known to act as early colonizers in the buildup of the dental biofilm known as dental plaque. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This signals that the streptococci may not be there alone - it is possible that there is a biofilm composed of many bacteria.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He noted that while in the biofilm, bacteria 'are safe inside the jelly-like cover and they do not cause any harm to the individual.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he said the 'situation changes dramatically' when the biofilm is activated through an infection or other cause, resulting in the bacteria spreading to the plaque and causing inflammation and blood clots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Chloe Burke went into cardiac arrest at 21 years old while cheering at the University of Houston due to an undiagnosed congenital heart defect&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Matias Escobar, pictured here in the middle, nearly died while competing in the New York City Triathlon in 2023 at age 38&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacteria may then lead to endocarditis, an infection in the inner lining of the heart and its valves, which strikes between 10,000 and 30,000 Americans every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition causes irregular growths made of germs and cell pieces to form clumps in the heart called vegetations, which can break loose and travel to the brain, lungs, kidneys or arteries, triggering heart failure, stroke, heart attack and blood clots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers cautioned that the findings are not definitive.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they noted they are studying 'the possibility of developing a vaccine against the formation of a biofilm and bacterial-induced thrombosis.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Elizabeth Klodas, chief medical officer and founder  of Step One Foods, &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a67948713/heart-attack-linked-to-bacterial-infection-study/"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;Prevention the study findings are a reminder that 'our various bodily systems are interconnected.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Getting regular dental check-ups and brushing our teeth and flossing is not only good for our mouths, but also for our hearts.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 01:49:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxPaE9JUU9LUTdiaEUwVUthNDhiV3N2NzRialE2NHVlMENMTHBKbEtHNndFd3ZUT1VzRlJIOGpUSVV1QTVaSUZmOUw3eEt6czRFMmtJN1BLeDJfY2I5YUhsejE5WldxT3VNSURfLVVaRzFYTUdPNEFMczZnZTNaQ0RhV0xsaVRTTUpCcGNCQkR5MXFqV3hldDA5U3o5Z3lidWRGb3NYWUVSSWFaSzZrXzgzZy1fRlh5Z9IBuwFBVV95cUxQUENCbENOSU5aMV9SWFJyRklSU2s5ODFIQVZEM2IxU1dmTUVnUmN1R0Q2Y3I0eUFLbFlEWEFUNXQxNVp5R1VzQ2JoQXpjLTlVVWlwWThPcXUyZURfN0R1V0cxSFNKZ1FJeFUyVm5vbmVzd2xpRUxfbkExSjhzTmpsNnczNG1vN1plOWlmYlc0dlMxSFJZTklubDV2R1VjMEZjaHFUUGE3WHp0TkROV0dPQjRHZ2hGVURKUms0</guid></item><item><title>明尼苏达州违反联邦政府的新冠肺炎疫苗指南- Star Tribune</title><link>https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-defies-feds-with-covid-vaccine-guidance/601478835</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Monday’s actions came at the prompting of an executive order by Gov.

now without the people to do a big deployment (if an outbreak occurs),” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases’ Demetre Daskalakis agreed, warning that health officials were “completely flying blind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item b-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="Former Centers for Disease

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But their meeting came at a tumultuous time for the CDC after the agency’s boss, &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-axed-cdc-boss-susan-monarez-after-daily-beast-covid-vaccine-bombshell/" rel=""&gt;Susan Monarez, was forced out of her job&lt;/a&gt; for resisting Kennedy’s controversial policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Monarez’s departure sparked a mass exodus at the top of the agency, with Jernigan, Daskalakis, and Chief Medical Officer Debra Houry also leaving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Speaking on a Zoom call on Monday, the trio said last week’s vaccine panel meeting—in which the group admitted they were “rookies”—confirmed their fears about how vaccine policy is being shaped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“The people deciding vaccine policy for the United States should not be rookies. That was beyond disappointing and disheartening,” said Houry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Daskalakis agreed. “Over 60 percent reduction in flu samples means that we don’t know what the next pandemic strain is going to be. We’re not going to be able to develop vaccines to be ready for seasonal flu or pandemic flu,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The chaos at the CDC has led to calls for Kennedy to resign. But the Health Secretary has defended the overhaul, telling a fiery Senate hearing this month that the agency had failed in its central mission: protecting Americans from infectious disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item b-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr." class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/RZT727WEWNHVRBHKMNFLRZSQ3U.jpg?auth=4358ae2172412fc9e6feb6108c4ae718080066b1552df53099b085cf5f114d30&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/RZT727WEWNHVRBHKMNFLRZSQ3U.jpg?auth=4358ae2172412fc9e6feb6108c4ae718080066b1552df53099b085cf5f114d30&amp;amp;width=274&amp;amp;height=182 274w, https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/RZT727WEWNHVRBHKMNFLRZSQ3U.jpg?auth=4358ae2172412fc9e6feb6108c4ae718080066b1552df53099b085cf5f114d30&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;height=266 400w, https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/RZT727WEWNHVRBHKMNFLRZSQ3U.jpg?auth=4358ae2172412fc9e6feb6108c4ae718080066b1552df53099b085cf5f114d30&amp;amp;width=768&amp;amp;height=511 768w, https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/RZT727WEWNHVRBHKMNFLRZSQ3U.jpg?auth=4358ae2172412fc9e6feb6108c4ae718080066b1552df53099b085cf5f114d30&amp;amp;width=1024&amp;amp;height=682 1024w, https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/RZT727WEWNHVRBHKMNFLRZSQ3U.jpg?auth=4358ae2172412fc9e6feb6108c4ae718080066b1552df53099b085cf5f114d30&amp;amp;width=1440&amp;amp;height=959 1440w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;Andrew Harnik/Getty Images &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“America is home to 4.2% of the world’s population, yet we had nearly 20% of the COVID deaths,” said Kennedy, a known conspiracy theorist and vaccine sceptic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We literally did worse than any country in the world, and the people at CDC who oversaw that process, who put masks on our children, who closed our schools, are the people who will be leaving.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Last week, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices chairman Martin Kulldorff hit out at critics he said were falsely claiming they were made up of “unscientific and dangerous anti-vaxxers.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Kulldorff, a former Harvard professor of medicine who lost his job after refusing the COVID vaccine, also challenged ex-CDC heads to debate him to prove they could be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“I suggest that you should only trust scientists that are willing to debate fellow scientists with different views,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Daily Beast</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 21:58:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxQNHBzY1drS3ljWmFWX00tUHBOYnB0bHF5cnVEeFVYY05UX3NpRE5WNlBBTTVVUVVFZ2Q3Qk9aSUpZR1NucjB4Z0dZM1NSblFucUtuQmFrOHpnSkxjYWVMd2xIT2xtdFZBTTAzeGlIelhnOHJ3MFlRQWMxOVdKUzZmZ0hwUUhMazhURmpfS3pNZnhVZWZ6b2VxOGZCV2NKMDQ</guid></item><item><title>夏皮罗政府发布疫苗指南，打破联邦“混乱” -匹兹堡邮报</title><link>https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2025/09/22/vaccine-guidelines-pa/stories/202509220043</link><description>&lt;body class="pgevoke bs-grid pg-hasicomoon pg-site-pg pg-user-checkingstatus pg-requesttype-story pgevoke-pageparentsection-news pg-piano" id="readabilityBody"&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Under our current age of Trump, it’s frankly stranger when the federal government doesn’t do something completely unproductive. The latest bit of pointlessness? The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has switched back to using the name “monkeypox”—an outdated label for the disease mpox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;NPR was the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/09/12/g-s1-88287/mpox-monkeypox-virus-stigma"&gt;first to report&lt;/a&gt; on the name switchback, which appears to have been implemented sometime in the last month. Nearly three years ago, virologists pushed for monkeypox to be retired, both for being potentially stigmatizing and factually inaccurate, since monkeys aren’t the primary hosts of the virus in the wild. HHS confirmed the switch to Gizmodo but offered no elaboration as to why it did so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why the change?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In November 2022, the World Health Organization officially &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/monkeypox-new-name-mpox-1849826028"&gt;adopted&lt;/a&gt; the label “mpox” to describe the viral disease, following a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/monkeypox-new-name-mpox-1849826028"&gt;concerted effort&lt;/a&gt; by relevant experts and scientists to retire “monkeypox.” This name was quickly reaffirmed by many health organizations and countries, including the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reasoning was twofold. One, though humans first discovered monkeypox in a group of lab monkeys in the 1950s, we now know that rodents are its predominant animal hosts. Since 2022, the disease has also spread widely between people, causing outbreaks across the globe—another sign of monkeypox’s outdatedness. Though outbreaks have generally lessened in most parts of the world, the disease still causes &lt;a href="https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/"&gt;large surges of illness&lt;/a&gt; to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Secondly, many scientists &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/metaphors-matter-why-changing-the-name-monkeypox-may-help-curb-the-discriminatory-language-used-to-discuss-it-185343"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; the harmful racial and ethnic connotations of the name. People have long used “monkey” as a racist shorthand for Black or African people, and some have cast monkeypox as strictly an “African” disease (mpox is still most prevalent in parts of Africa, but the global outbreak has clearly illustrated that it doesn’t respect borders).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Boghuma Titanji, a virus researcher at Emory University originally from Cameroon, recounted to NPR how her attempts to share information about the mpox outbreaks in 2022 quickly led to a pile-on from racist trolls on social media. “Likening me to a monkey, asking me to go back to Africa, where people have sex with monkeys, and being someone who defends gay sex with monkeys. Those were some of the really, really dark messages that I got in my inbox,” she told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;What’s in a name?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is, admittedly, some room for confusion here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As it turns out, different organizations are responsible for naming a virus as opposed to the disease it causes. And while most experts and health agencies defer to the WHO’s guidance for a disease’s name, it’s the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) that decides the formal name of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Right around the same time that WHO was considering a name change, the ICTV stated that it would not drastically change its labeling of the virus behind mpox. Though the group has been updating its classification of many virus groups lately, it ultimately only added a &lt;a href="https://ictv.global/report/chapter/poxviridae/poxviridae/orthopoxvirus"&gt;broader label&lt;/a&gt; in front to illustrate its closeness to other similar pox viruses. So its official species name is now &lt;i&gt;Orthopoxvirus monkeypox &lt;/i&gt;(if it’s any consolation, many scientists have &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/silly-and-pompous-official-new-names-viruses-rile-researchers"&gt;complained&lt;/a&gt; about the ICTV’s virus name updating for other reasons).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s this distinction that HHS may be hanging its hat on in order to support the name switch. An HHS spokesperson told Gizmodo, “Monkeypox is the name of the viral disease caused by the monkeypox virus.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be clear, though, that’s not accurate. Or at least, monkeypox isn’t the name that most every other health agency around the world now uses for the viral disease caused by the monkeypox virus; that’s mpox. That long list also currently includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since the agency (part of HHS) is still using mpox on its &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/about/index.html"&gt;webpage&lt;/a&gt; about the disease. Since the last update of that page occurred in April 2025, though, it’s probably only a matter of time before that changes as well.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;As for why the federal government is doing this, who honestly knows? Trump and other members of his administration have made it clear that they despise the WHO, to the point of &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-trumps-decision-to-leave-the-who-is-a-catastrophe-in-the-making-2000552752"&gt;stripping away the funding&lt;/a&gt; the U.S. has historically provided to the agency. But that doesn’t really explain why the change is happening now. For all we know, someone got in Trump’s or Health Secretary RFK Jr.’s ear last month and scared them into thinking “mpox” is too woke a term for the U.S. to endorse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What we can say for sure is how utterly pointless any of this is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers found that zeaxanthin, long associated with eye health, may also boost the body’s immune response against cancer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent study, scientists at the &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/university-of-chicago/"&gt;&lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_7b1595855b85627e26ccff3575b6e1d0" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that zeaxanthin, a carotenoid derived from plants and traditionally recognized for supporting eye health, may also enhance immune function by boosting the tumor-fighting abilities of certain immune cells. Published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_5320548253fb53903fe4d0f8f1485d98" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/span&gt; Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, the research points to zeaxanthin’s promise as an accessible supplement that could improve the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised to find that zeaxanthin, already known for its role in eye health, has a completely new function in boosting anti-tumor immunity,” said Jing Chen, PhD, Janet Davison Rowley Distinguished Service Professor of Medicine and senior author of the study. “Our study shows that a simple dietary nutrient could complement and strengthen advanced cancer treatments like immunotherapy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How does this nutrient work?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chen’s laboratory has spent years investigating how nutrients shape immune function, and this study extends that effort. By screening an extensive library of blood nutrients, the team pinpointed zeaxanthin as a compound that directly boosts the activity of CD8+ T cells, the immune cells responsible for killing tumor cells. These T cells depend on a structure known as the T-cell receptor (TCR) to detect and eliminate abnormal cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that zeaxanthin helps stabilize and reinforce the TCR complex on CD8+ T cells when they engage with cancer cells. This strengthening effect amplifies intracellular signaling, leading to greater T-cell activation, higher cytokine production, and improved tumor-killing performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Zeaxanthin improves immunotherapy effects&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mouse experiments, dietary zeaxanthin supplementation slowed the progression of tumors. Even more striking, when paired with immune checkpoint inhibitors—a widely used form of cancer immunotherapy—zeaxanthin markedly increased anti-tumor activity compared to immunotherapy on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To extend the findings, the researchers tested human T cells engineered to recognize specific tumor antigens and found that zeaxanthin treatment improved these cells’ ability to kill melanoma, multiple myeloma, and glioblastoma cells in laboratory experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our data show that zeaxanthin improves both natural and engineered T-cell responses, which suggests high translational potential for patients undergoing immunotherapies,” Chen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A safe and accessible candidate&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zeaxanthin is sold as an over-the-counter supplement for eye health, and is naturally found in vegetables like orange peppers, spinach, and kale. It’s inexpensive, widely available, well-tolerated and, most importantly, its safety profile is known – which means it can be safely tested as an adjunct to cancer therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also reinforces the importance of a balanced diet. In their previous research, Chen’s group discovered that &lt;a href="https://biologicalsciences.uchicago.edu/news/tva-nutrient-cancer-immunity"&gt;trans-vaccenic &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_9745a074b5eb990461959ea2eda628f3" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;acid&lt;/span&gt; (TVA), a fatty acid derived from dairy and meat&lt;/a&gt;, also boosts T-cell activity – but through a different mechanism. Together, the findings suggest that nutrients from both plant and animal sources may provide complementary benefits to immune health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Clinical applications of zeaxanthin&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the results are promising, the researchers emphasize that the work is still at an early stage. Most of the findings come from laboratory experiments and animal studies. Thus, clinical trials will be needed to determine whether zeaxanthin supplements can improve outcomes for cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings open a new field of nutritional immunology that looks at how specific dietary components interact with the immune system at the molecular level,” Chen said. “With more research, we may discover natural compounds that make today’s cancer therapies more effective and accessible.”&lt;/p&gt;

Out of a sample of 149 people, about half of whom had been diagnosed with autism, his test correctly identified more than 97% of the autistic people, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, a similar study conducted at Boston Children’s Hospital started with 416 people who were known to be autistic or not. The blood test appeared to be 85% accurate, but the scientists said they needed more samples. They are now following infants who were identified by the blood test to see how reliably it predicts autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hahn subsequently looked for fecal abnormalities in people with autism.

Scientific consensus is clear, and further studies are not warranted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead of providing certainty, Dr. Juergen Hahn’s proposed work will provide legitimacy to vaccine skeptics by suggesting that a causal link between vaccination and autism is even conceivable,” Trujillo wrote to the board of trustees. “Vaccine hesitancy is on the rise globally, in part driven by perceived risk of vaccination. In contributing to this hesitancy, (RPI) will be complicit in decreasing vaccination rates, a return of once-defeated diseases like measles, and ultimately, unnecessary suffering and early deaths. I urge the institute to reconsider their CDC contract, for the good of humanity and their own reputation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC is having its own difficulties right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-5" data-large-id="Inline-7" data-unit="hnp-timesunion.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices took a vote and then the next day reversed it regarding the shot known as the MMRV — measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox (which is called varicella). The panel first decided the MMRV &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-vaccines-acip-hepatitis-b-chickenpox-21623ff8ead38ae1b21db488ee82a1f8" data-link="native" class=""&gt;should not be given to children under the age of 4&lt;/a&gt;, because some young children have febrile seizures after the shot. Febrile seizures aren’t dangerous — they don’t cause brain damage, for example — but they can be terrifying for the caregivers, panel members noted. But they voted to allow the Vaccines for Children program to cover the cost of that vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the next day, the panel decided not to allow the Vaccines for Children program to pay for the MMRV shot. Panel members said &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/health/cdc-vaccines-mmrv-hepatitis-b.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;they were confused&lt;/a&gt; by the wording of the previous day’s proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, the vaccine for chickenpox is administered in a separate shot from the vaccine, but at the same visit. But some doctors argued that the combined shot is easier because children only have to endure one needle instead of two. Doctors argued combined shots are especially important in areas where it’s hard to keep the children on the vaccine schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Past controversies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The modern controversy over vaccines and autism traces to a late-1990s study that has since been discredited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-6" data-large-id="Inline-8" data-unit="hnp-timesunion.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A scientist in the UK &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2831678/#:~:text=In%20a%20statement%20published%20on,in%20lawsuits%20against%20vaccine%20manufacturers." data-link="native" class=""&gt;altered study results&lt;/a&gt; in 1998 to make it look like the popular vaccine for measles had caused autism. The scientist, Andrew Wakefield, was at the time trying to market his own version of the measles vaccine. He was exposed by a journalist and &lt;a href="https://www.hcplive.com/view/autism_doctor#:~:text=After%20a%20lengthy%20investigation%2C%20England's,on%20children%20without%20official%20permission." data-link="native" class=""&gt;lost his medical license&lt;/a&gt;. The study was based on 12 children, some of whom actually did not have autism and some of whom had symptoms before vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the idea he proposed, that vaccines given in early childhood could cause autism, has never gone away. It has been studied repeatedly, with no connections found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is first given when children are around 12 to 15 months old. That’s around the same time that they start to speak. Some parents have described their children as losing skills in babbling, making eye contact and soothing themselves around that time, which leads to an association with the vaccine. That is now diagnosed as “regressive” autism, but doctors do not yet know what causes it; scientists have considered genetic and environmental factors. Statistically, the regression happens around 19 months, long after the vaccine is administered, but it can happen as early as 15 months, which is when the vaccine is often given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-7" data-large-id="Inline-9" data-unit="hnp-timesunion.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times Union</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 19:52:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOb2RVbXNNY29WOXdpb1RRU3pnTDZKTGtZVXgxMGQxZU1ZbjkySEIyb01XZXNmSlNwbWZ1eEhSZ01nMVFZNlRsaVJweXJ2OTFhRHVEcEIxTXZTQTlfSGVIcWJzeDlZWjJicGtmeU9Gb3pBXzBqQTBRek54VlNKQ2d6aWdsZjg3RjBfckZaWkdRVmlUQU9QWVZDanpn</guid></item><item><title>为什么女性要承受痴呆症的负担：解开性别差距- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-women-burden-dementia-unraveling-sex.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly two-thirds of Americans diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease are women, and they often experience faster cognitive decline than men. The reasons behind this sex gap have largely remained a mystery—until now.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Research led by Dr. Farida Sohrabji, Regents Professor and director of the Women's Health in Neuroscience Program at Texas A&amp;amp;M University, observed that biological sex significantly increases the risk of stroke in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/older+women/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;older women&lt;/a&gt;, a condition that accelerates the onset and progression of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In every decade after 50," explained Sohrabji, "women are more likely to experience stroke compared to men, especially severe strokes. This significantly fuels the risk for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+impairment/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt; and eventual dementia, and is fundamental for future drug developments and personalized medicine."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A new approach to treatment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sohrabji's findings support a growing body of research in precision medicine, an approach that tailors medical care to individual characteristics, such as biological sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Similar drugs don't always work as effectively or the same across sexes. Even though the disease or condition may be the same, the effect of treatments on male and female brains may not be," said Sohrabji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This insight is urgent for Alzheimer's care, where women make up the majority of patients. For women 60 and over, the risk of developing Alzheimer's is almost twice as likely as the risk of breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We already customize and personalize treatments for certain cancers," Sohrabji said. "It's fundamental that we do the same for stroke and dementia, and I believe it will lead to better outcomes overall."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sohrabji's lab set out to understand why women are disproportionately affected by dementia and Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One key discovery points to hormonal changes during menopause. As estrogen levels drop, the brains of women become more vulnerable to inflammation, damage and ultimately stroke—known contributors to dementia and Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found estrogen appears to protect against stroke," she said. "In fact, in models where ovaries are removed, stroke outcomes worsened, yet were reversed with estrogen treatment."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the evidence is complex, and the relationship isn't straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We repeated the same study and used estrogen replacement to see if it would protect older female model populations. To our surprise, it did not," Sohrabji explained. "Estrogen was actually toxic. It made the loss of brain tissue more severe, impairment more severe and when we followed them long term, they showed signs of clear neurodegeneration."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;The promise of sex-specific therapies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on these complex results, Sohrabji and her team explored whether a small peptide called IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor), in combination with estrogen therapy, could improve outcomes for middle-aged female models, and their findings were groundbreaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only did the combination reverse the usually toxic effects of estrogen to this older group, but subsequent studies showed that IGF-1 treatment alone is sufficient to improve &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/stroke/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you gave the subjects &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/estrogen/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;estrogen&lt;/a&gt; and IGF-1, you clearly see neuroprotective effects," Sohrabji said. "In fact, IGF-1 treatment itself was one of the most neuroprotective molecules we have ever tested."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other work, the researchers tested a small, non-coding RNA molecule, and again, the results were striking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Administering the agent both protected brain tissue and noticeably reduced long-term signs of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+decline/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest the agent played a protective role in the process, and it was most effective in older female subjects compared to age-matched males," Sohrabji said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sex differences matter in brain research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sohrabji's research represents a shift from one-size-fits-all treatments to tailored therapies, adding to a growing call in neuroscience and medicine in recognizing the importance of sex differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These differences aren't minor, they're profound. It's why we see women bear the burden of chronic diseases like dementia and Alzheimer's," Sohrabji said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By advancing sex-specific research, Sohrabji is championing a promising future where the burden of Alzheimer's no longer falls hardest on women, and where therapies advance overall human health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As a basic scientist, and in my personal journeys, we follow our passions to improving human health and to solving these really important problems," Sohrabji said.&lt;/p&gt;

You’ve got a PSA of 55 and you’ve got prostate cancer,’” Steves tells TODAY.com. “It was all hands on deck to change over to: How are we going to address that prostate?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-324a49" class="body-graf"&gt;Having a &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/prostate-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/tests.html" target="_blank"&gt;PSA level over 10 increases&lt;/a&gt; one’s likelihood of having prostate cancer, says the American Cancer Society. Steves says he wants to share his story to increase awareness of PSA testing and prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f91f8d" class="body-graf"&gt;“If I can help people be more mindful and smart with their health, especially as they get into the age that I’m at, that’s a beautiful thing to do with my celebrity,” he says. “Talk about it. Say the word prostate cancer. Demystify it. That’s really important so that people can be comfortable talking about something a lot of people think is private.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-d635e3" class="body-heading"&gt;‘Feeling So Good’ &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f8eb98" class="body-graf"&gt;Hearing the news in August 2024 was shocking to Steves because he felt healthy and had spoken to his doctor about how he could continue to travel and embrace life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-94bf80" class="body-graf"&gt;“I was feeling so good. 69 years old, looking at 70, feeling great,” he says. “We were talking about wellness, and diet, and exercise and how to enjoy the next years and be really healthy.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-76f5ea"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1850" data-original-width="2500"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-09/rick-steves-prostate-cancer-zz-250922-01-b9696a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/rick-steves-prostate-cancer-zz-250922-01-b9696a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-09/rick-steves-prostate-cancer-zz-250922-01-b9696a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/rick-steves-prostate-cancer-zz-250922-01-b9696a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/rick-steves-prostate-cancer-zz-250922-01-b9696a.jpg" alt="After learning he had prostate cancer, travel writer Rick Steves opted for surgery to have his prostate removed.

And it did. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-859b33" class="body-graf"&gt;“After three months, I was just fine,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-480df6" class="body-graf"&gt;Several months after surgery, Steves underwent another PSA test to see if doctors had removed all the cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1e5e08" class="body-graf"&gt;“The psychological thing for me was it was really strange to be in the waiting stage,” he says. “You’re helpless.

From 2014 through 2021, it increased by 3% every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7a6532" class="body-graf"&gt;Dahut says there’s multiple things driving this increase. One issue is that PSA screenings declined after the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force said the testing did “more harm than good,” in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4f003d" class="body-graf"&gt;“There was a dramatic fall in men who had PSA testing,” Dahut says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-227340" class="body-graf"&gt;Six years later, that decision was revised and it's now recommended that men between 55 and 70 talk to their doctors about PSA testing, what’s known as informed decision making. Some men should undergo screening because of family history or past abnormal blood testing, while others might not need to check their PSA levels often. But this can be confusing. Today, the percentage of men undergoing PSA screening is low, Dahut adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-38d3d9" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you look at the history of prostate cancer clinically, you know it can be indolent for years and years, then over time it can evolve to where the cancer is more aggressive and ultimately spread,” Dahut says. “It’s not surprising if screening went down and then over time you would see more men presenting with more advanced disease.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-129a54" class="body-graf"&gt;Dahut notes that other causes can play a role in increasing rates, such as environmental factors, diet and lack of exercise, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-061710" class="body-graf"&gt;Prostate cancer does not have any symptoms until later stages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fe8f2a" class="body-graf"&gt;“Symptoms generally occur when the cancer has spread. If it has spread into the bladder, you might get blood in your urine,” Dahut says. “If it spreads to the bones or elsewhere, you have pain, or fatigue, or weight loss.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-653f85" class="body-graf"&gt;Treatment for prostate cancer can include observation, a prostatectomy, radiation and testosterone blocking, also called hormone therapy. Some people diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer could only ever need observation, which has advanced as MRI technology has improved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5a74a2" class="body-graf"&gt;“Some men’s cancer never progresses,” Dahut says. “Men sometimes will opt for treatment because there’s anxiety knowing that there’s a cancer.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-897d7d" class="body-graf"&gt;With prostate cancer, there’s a strong “familial component,” which means knowing one’s family history can be important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9f9a5b" class="body-graf"&gt;“People are probably not aware of the importance of family history and when one should be screened for prostate cancer,” Dahut says. “It’s not discussed that much. And if you have a strong family history of prostate cancer, you should probably begin discussing screening at age 40, for example.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-d1b76d" class="body-heading"&gt;‘Be Open’ About Prostate Cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-01b4bc" class="body-graf"&gt;Since being diagnosed, Steves has met many cancer survivors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b9a134" class="body-graf"&gt;“What’s astonishing to me or remarkable to me is how secretive it is — unless you’re a member, then people are forthcoming,” he says. “I had friends of mine and work colleagues (who) had prostate cancer, and I never knew. They were very good at keeping it a secret, and that’s the norm.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-0813d1"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1875" data-original-width="2500"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-09/rick-steves-prostate-cancer-zz-250922-04-fa2f94.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/rick-steves-prostate-cancer-zz-250922-04-fa2f94.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-09/rick-steves-prostate-cancer-zz-250922-04-fa2f94.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/rick-steves-prostate-cancer-zz-250922-04-fa2f94.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/rick-steves-prostate-cancer-zz-250922-04-fa2f94.jpg" alt="Rick Steves enjoys a hike in the Dolomites in Italy."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Rick Steves enjoys a hike in the Dolomites in Italy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Rick Steves&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e1b09b" class="body-graf"&gt;Steves didn’t want to keep his diagnosis to himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b4d5ec" class="body-graf"&gt;“I feel like people need to be open about what’s going on in their lives, and people care,” he says. “I feel it’s very important for people to be tuned into their bodies.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c91f7b" class="body-graf"&gt;He admits that his busy schedule meant he became “sloppy” with his health and hopes that others take theirs seriously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a5e091" class="body-graf"&gt;“I was too busy to be tested,” he says. “I was too busy to care.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8f386a" class="body-graf"&gt;Since undergoing prostate cancer treatment, Steves feels a lot of gratitude for the doctors and cancer researchers who helped him have a positive outcome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6913db" class="body-graf"&gt;“I wouldn’t be here without research,” he says. “We need to embrace the value of medical research, and we need to fund it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d11a64" class="body-graf"&gt;He “marvels” at the advances that helped him continue traveling and sharing with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bf6dbd" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“I’m standing here right now traveling, writing guidebooks, making TV shows, having fun and inspiring people to reach out and embrace the world through their travels,” he says. “That is why God put me on this planet, and I’ve got some good years ahead of me thanks to medical research.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 19:05:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxPNF9GWWE2RkVhaXZlOW5DYTBYYWMzMnAwUWtWZXhZMURCaDZSMUhTMTRZbDRUUWx1NGQwdWV0cW5TR2RQMzZwRjhYdmNGQmJvVDREZWViYlRQSUQyYkZkZTNHTWxZTDdxYXNMVlFGTXktQy1aWkNPdHZJZy01eHFtdUdtb2ZNTFl1ZnhaRU5oczdUSHJZTHB30gFUQVVfeXFMTk9PR1dYQkdRUEhoOHpnY1VrWWUyVFNxQV9BTzRHbEUxdGVwYnBKN2VFeDJHSmZtUy1iRURHa05zODR4NlE5ZVNXcFVnNXpsNzJKWUxZ</guid></item><item><title>口腔细菌可能引发帕金森病-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/oral-bacteria-parkinsons-disease-29720/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Scientists have uncovered a direct link between oral bacteria and Parkinson’s disease. They found that Streptococcus mutans, best known for causing cavities, can settle in the gut and release metabolites that reach the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These metabolites trigger neuronal loss, neuroinflammation, and motor impairments resembling Parkinson’s. The findings suggest that targeting the oral–gut microbiome could lead to novel strategies for preventing or treating the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oral–Gut–Brain Link:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus mutans&lt;/em&gt; can migrate from mouth to gut and affect the brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toxic Metabolite:&lt;/strong&gt; Its metabolite ImP damages dopaminergic neurons and promotes Parkinson’s pathology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Blocking mTORC1 signaling reduced neuroinflammation and motor symptoms in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;POSTECH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is now one more reason to brush your teeth thoroughly every day.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have identified the mechanism by which metabolites produced by oral bacteria in the gut may trigger the development of Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were published online on September 5 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease is a major neurological disorder characterized by tremors, stiffness, and slowed movement. It affects approximately 1-2% of the global population over the age of 65, making it one of the most common age-related brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although previous studies suggested that the gut microbiota of individuals with Parkinson’s differs from that of healthy individuals, the specific microbes and metabolites have remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found an increased abundance of &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus mutans&lt;/em&gt;—a well-known oral bacterium that causes dental caries—in the gut microbiome of Parkinson’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, &lt;em&gt;S. mutans&lt;/em&gt; produces the enzyme urocanate reductase (UrdA) and its metabolite imidazole propionate (ImP), both of which were present at elevated levels in the gut and blood of patients. ImP appeared capable of entering systemic circulation, reaching the brain, and contributing to the loss of dopaminergic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mouse models, the researchers introduced &lt;em&gt;S. mutans&lt;/em&gt; into the gut or engineered &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; to express UrdA. As a result, the mice showed elevated ImP levels in blood and brain tissue, along with the hallmark features of Parkinson’s symptoms: loss of dopaminergic neurons, heightened neuroinflammation, impaired motor function, and increased aggregation of alpha-synuclein, a protein central to disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further experiments demonstrated that these effects depend on the activation of the signaling protein complex mTORC1. Treating mice with an mTORC1 inhibitor significantly reduced neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and alpha-synuclein aggregation, and motor dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that targeting the oral–gut microbiome and its metabolites may offer new therapeutic strategies for Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of how oral microbes in the gut can influence the brain and contribute to the development of Parkinson’s disease,” said Professor Ara Koh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It highlights the potential of targeting the gut microbiota as a therapeutic strategy, offering a new direction for Parkinson’s treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was supported by the Samsung Research Funding &amp;amp; Incubation Center of Samsung Electronics, the Mid-Career Researcher Program of the Ministry of Science and ICT, the Microbiome Core Research Support Center, and the Biomedical Technology Development Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Parkinsons’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#88e3f1edbebcb8bfc8f8e7fbfcedebe0a6e9eba6e3fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Yung-Eui Kang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://postech.ac.kr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;POSTECH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Yung-Eui Kang – POSTECH&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63473-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gut microbial production of imidazole propionate drives Parkinson’s pathologies&lt;/a&gt;” by Ara Koh et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gut microbial production of imidazole propionate drives Parkinson’s pathologies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the selective degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and aggregation of α-synuclein. Emerging evidence implicates the gut microbiome in PD, with microbial metabolites proposed as potential pathological mediators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the specific microbes and metabolites involved, and whether gut-derived metabolites can reach the brain to directly induce neurodegeneration, remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show that elevated levels of &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus mutans&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;S. mutans&lt;/em&gt;) and its enzyme urocanate reductase (UrdA), which produces imidazole propionate (ImP), in the gut microbiome of patients with PD, along with increased plasma ImP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colonization of mice with &lt;em&gt;S. mutans&lt;/em&gt; harboring UrdA or &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; expressing UrdA from &lt;em&gt;S. mutans&lt;/em&gt; increases systemic and brain ImP levels, inducing PD-like symptoms including dopaminergic neuronal loss, astrogliosis, microgliosis, and motor impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;em&gt;S. mutans&lt;/em&gt; exacerbates α-synuclein pathology in a mouse model. ImP administration alone recapitulates key PD features, supporting the UrdA–ImP axis as a microbial driver of PD pathology. Mechanistically, mTORC1 activation is crucial for both &lt;em&gt;S. mutans&lt;/em&gt;– and ImP-induced PD pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings identify microbial ImP, produced via UrdA, as a direct pathological mediator of the gut-brain axis in PD.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 18:21:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTFBZZ1ZwUWpCSVJ0QW0tRS1xRkw0Y3RzYV9PVW1qSGUyVk5WOUc5akctNVRGdGZPVFNHZkxLR2lLLVY3ZGtVRWR2ckEzNzBNQmc2MUFDWGRUVjROQVVlY1p5NXpNdVphVXJxNW85NkNwejI2WF9HQnJZ</guid></item><item><title>这个小工具能治愈我吵闹的打鼾吗？我丈夫希望如此-泰晤士报</title><link>https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/snorelab-snoring-solution-zeus-women-52cl8t05s</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;I still find it hard to believe — and admit publicly — that most nights I inflict the most unladylike sounds on him, which range from resembling a faulty drill to a constipated warthog. But there’s no hiding from a surveillance app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;To see just how bad things have been getting for my husband I downloaded SnoreLab, one of several free phone apps that tracks and (mortifyingly)&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; records your nocturnal noise levels. It showed that last Wednesday I snored for 49 per cent of the 7 hours 16 minutes I was asleep — half an hour of that “loudly”. On Thursday and Friday it was 20 per cent of the night, and on Saturday 35 per cent. Playing back the “audio evidence”, my phone broadcasts the regular growlings, bursting every so often into night-splitting harrumphs. Could that really be me? Often for two to three hours a night?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;However, help could now be at hand in the form of a wearable device called a Zeus, which has been 15 years in development by the respiration and sleep experts at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust and King’s College London. After three positive clinical trials, next month it will begin a £1.5 million trial across six NHS trusts, funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. The aim is for it to be endorsed as an NHS treatment for snoring and the more serious condition of obstructive sleep apnoea, which is at present treated with a cumbersome mask you strap to your face each night called a &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/cpap-sleep-disorder-device-cuts-risk-of-needing-ventilator-rd2fwgv9r" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine&lt;/a&gt;. This new device promises to be a lot less intrusive but will it work for me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/business-money/companies/article/sleep-tech-health-fitness-trackers-qcmpnkvcc" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gen Zzzs: Is ‘sleep tech’ really on a par with fitness trackers?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;First, what exactly makes some 41 per cent of the UK adult population — and yes almost as many women as men, even if they are less likely to admit it — snore? Snoring happens when the muscles that support our tongue and throat relax when we are asleep, causing our upper airway to narrow, explains Professor Joerg Steier, who led the Zeus team and is a consultant in respiratory and sleep medicine at Guy’s and St Thomas’. This narrowing makes the walls in our upper airway flutter or touch, causing a noise as air passes through with each breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt; “When we are awake the brain tells our muscles to keep that upper airway wide open, which is why we don’t snore in the day,” he says. “But in sleep, when we go into our ‘standby mode’, the activity that the brain uses to activate these muscles drops out and the walls are no longer supported.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Contributing to the narrowing airway is the fact that our tongue tends to glide backwards as we relax and gets further pulled by gravity when we lie down, typically on our backs, which is the sleeping position most likely to result in snoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Loud snoring isn’t bad for us, Steier says, but if the walls touch enough that the airway closes, that becomes obstructive sleep apnoea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“The air is blocked so you momentarily stop breathing, which then typically wakes you up,” Steier says. People with sleep apnoea will have their sleep broken many times a night — as many as 100 — which could lead to long-term health issues including chronic sleepiness, depression and cardiovascular health risks, according to Steier, who has spent the past 20 years researching treatments for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A 2023 Snoring and Sleep &lt;a href="https://sleepreviewmag.com/sleep-disorders/breathing-disorders/snoring/global-study-reveals-high-prevalence-snoring" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; found that almost half of men and a third of women snore. A separate YouGov &lt;a href="https://yougov.co.uk/society/articles/2240-does-your-partner-snore" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; in the UK found that women admit to snoring much less than men. And it gets worse with age: 77 per cent of 55 to 64-year-olds reportedly snore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;It’s also exacerbated by obesity and by the menopause, when women lose the elasticity in their muscles. Even &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/dr-mark-porter-why-your-snoring-could-be-a-wake-up-call-to-something-more-serious-8lj9wvxvq" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;just one glass of wine over dinner adds to the problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Alcohol, even a small amount, makes us more relaxed and that means our muscles are more relaxed so the airway is more collapsible,” Steier says. “The amount of alcohol that would stop you driving a car is making it likely you start snoring.” This might explain why I was particularly noisy on Wednesday night, after going to a book launch, and on Saturday, after meeting friends in the pub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/luxury/article/most-effective-snoring-solutions-times-luxury-pkf2p6gsj" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The most effective — and chic — snoring solutions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Until now the most common remedies are to try to lie on your side or front when you sleep, which helps to prevent the tongue shifting backwards, or to wear a mouthpiece that helps to keep the tongue forward. My desperate husband often nudges me in the night to turn over but if I do I sometimes even wake myself up with a great harrumph, I am not keen to wear a mouthpiece — my Invisalign night retainer is pain enough — let alone strap on a Darth Vaderish CPAP mask. Blowing pressurised room air into your upper airway to keep it open may be an effective treatment for sleep apnoea but 30 per cent of people who try the device get fed up with using it within a year, according to the Sleep Apnoea Trust (it estimates that as many as &lt;a href="https://sleep-apnoea-trust.org/research" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;eight million people&lt;/a&gt; in the UK may have the issue to some degree).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The medical team behind the new Zeus device — which has been developed in conjunction with an award-winning British biomedical engineering company, Morgan Innovation and Technology — hope snorers will find their invention unobtrusive enough to wear easily at night. It is shaped like a tiny boomerang and you attach it under your chin with a sticky pad before you go to sleep. It’s not the most glamorous of bedroom accessories but then there’s little glamour in turning into a warthog of a night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The Zeus works by using a mini Tens machine (short for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) to deliver small electrical impulses to stimulate the genioglossus muscle that holds the tongue in place, with the aim of keeping it toned. “The initial thought was that it doesn’t take a lot for the brain to keep the upper airway in shape when we’re awake but this tone falls away when we fall asleep,” Steier says. “So we thought if we could maintain that tone, we won’t even need a big contraction of the muscles. We just need enough to keep the upper airway in shape. And how do we do this? Could we use electrical stimulation?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Tens machines are used to help relieve back pain, period and labour pain, and arthritis by stimulating targeted muscles to improve blood flow. In the Zeus, stimulation is directed under the jaw. It is also possible to stimulate the genioglossus muscle via an implant linked to the hyperglossal nerve but, Steier says, “We wanted to find a way to stimulate this muscle without the need for surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/struggling-with-snoring-blowing-through-a-conch-might-help-80t9gp626" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Struggling with snoring? Blowing through a conch might help&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;To operate it you adjust tiny knobs embedded in it until you can feel the vibrations but not to such an extent that they keep you awake. The device then waits 20 minutes for you to fall asleep before starting up. Until it is endorsed as a NHS medical treatment, it is on sale for £250.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;So did it help me? In truth my experience has not been the slam dunk my husband prayed for. On the first night, it fell off while I was asleep — it turns out that night cream will stop it sticking, which may be a deal breaker for a lot of women. Although according to Nigel Clarke, CEO of Morgan Innovation and Technology, in the long term electrical stimulation may help to tone the neck, which would be quite the bonus. On the second night I had higher hopes, drifting off to the feeling of tiny buzzes in my jaw. However, I woke to find that my SnoreLab score was still terrible — I’d snored for an hour and a half, 20 minutes of that loudly. “Like a drunken sergeant,” as my husband put it. Oh, the mortification. And how disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In the three clinical trials during its development, 60 per cent of a total of 109 patients found that the technology lowered their sleep apnoea. Meanwhile, in an additional 2022 trial with 17 patients, conducted by the sleep charity Hope2Sleep, 82 per cent said that it helped them to reduce their snoring. And in a 2024 clinical trial on 48 sleep apnoea patients in a Dorset County Hospital NHS Trust, 84 per cent reported better quality of sleep. So far 1,500 devices have been sold worldwide, with fewer than 5 per cent being returned under a money back guarantee, Clarke says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Dr Allie Hare, consultant in sleep medicine at the Royal Brompton Hospital and co-founder of the specialist Grace Sleep clinic, also believes the device “is a helpful addition to the treatment options for snoring and milder forms of sleep”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/snoring-problem-marriage-experience-first-person-hjw37lf23" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;OK, I admit it — I’m a snorer. It’s my dirty (noisy) bedtime secret&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;So was I doing something wrong? Steier says that the device works best if the reason you snore is that your tongue is moving backwards and blocking your airway. But if it’s being blocked by other issues, such as the vertical walls losing their tone, then pulling the tongue back may not make a difference. Maybe I am one of those cases. Or was it simply operator error?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For the subsequent four trial nights, I stuck it a bit further under my chin and it certainly seemed to work better — my snore scores for those nights were significantly lower. One morning my husband said he thought I’d left to sleep in another room as our bedroom was so uncharacteristically quiet. It’s not perfect but, while my SnoreLab app has replayed some continued grumblings, it’s now more creaky door than full warthog. I think we’d take that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;And despite the way it looks, it is fairly easy to get used to wearing it once you’ve faffed about with sticky pads and remembered to charge it every day, so I’m prepared to persevere. After all, research by Zeus suggests that in snoring households, 28 per cent of partners end up sleeping in separate rooms. We’re not at that stage yet. The Zeus may look like a passion killer but if my husband can have his nights back, I’m sure we can work around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;&lt;a href="http://zeussleeps.com/" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;zeussleeps.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPOTJCT20tVGl2blFPcmt0LWFqS1htT1FUbm5LRTRUSmhPOWdUcjlRS0lUTEpfeWNYc053ZU5PVUpaa2c2a05CNHBGbG9kLUlzVGxJZ3BJdFQzZ0g4VE9PSVRWVDBMTThkOUZOOWFwTlMxNTZBMDRIVjZkaWd1bDMwNmF0VThtQS02dWhMQnJSVVRDaDNlTmR4dWY3NVgweWlhcm9LMDF2b0U</guid></item><item><title>新的小便测试可以识别前列腺癌- futurity.org</title><link>https://www.futurity.org/urine-based-test-prostate-cancers-3296042/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="stickem-container"&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;Researchers have created a new urine-based test to ID prostate cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new approach could significantly reduce the need for invasive, often painful biopsies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By analyzing urine samples from prostate cancer patients before and after prostate-removal surgery, as well as samples from healthy individuals, researchers identified a panel of three biomarkers—TTC3, H4C5, and EPCAM—that robustly detected the presence of prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These biomarkers were detectable in patients prior to surgery but were nearly absent post-surgery, confirming that they originated in prostate tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results appear in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2025.105895"&gt;&lt;em&gt;eBioMedicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prostate cancer, one of the leading causes of death in men in the United States, is typically detected by blood tests to measure PSA, a protein produced by cancerous and noncancerous tissue in the prostate. In most men, a PSA level above 4.0 nanograms per milliliter is considered abnormal and may result in a recommendation for prostate biopsy, in which multiple samples of tissue are collected through small needles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the PSA test is not very specific, meaning prostate biopsies are often needed to confirm a cancer diagnosis, says senior study author Ranjan Perera, director of the Center for RNA Biology at Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital in St. Petersburg, Florida, and a professor of oncology and neurosurgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. In many cases, these biopsies are negative and can result in unintended complications, Perera says. PSA tests also can lead to unnecessary treatment for very low-grade prostate cancers that are very unlikely to grow and spread over a short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This new biomarker panel offers a promising, sensitive, and specific, noninvasive diagnostic test for prostate cancer,” Perera says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It has the potential to accurately detect prostate cancer, reduce unnecessary biopsies, improve diagnostic accuracy in PSA-negative patients, and serve as the foundation for both laboratory-developed and in vitro diagnostic assays.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel was found to be able to detect prostate cancer even when PSA was in the normal range and could distinguish prostate cancer from conditions like prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) and an enlarged prostate, a condition known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a real need for non-PSA-based biomarkers for prostate cancer, and urine is quite easy to collect in the clinic,” says study coauthor Christian Pavlovich, a professor of urologic oncology at Johns Hopkins and program director for the Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most urologists feel that an accurate &lt;a href="https://www.futurity.org/dogs-smell-prostate-cancer-2534232/"&gt;urinary biomarker&lt;/a&gt; would be a valuable addition to our current diagnostic armamentarium.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the study, investigators studied biomarkers in urine samples from healthy individuals as well as from patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer undergoing prostate-removal surgeries at Johns Hopkins Hospital, Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, or AdventHealth Global Robotics Institute in Celebration, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They studied 341 urine specimens (107 from healthy individuals, 136 from patients with prostate cancer before surgery, and 98 after surgery) during the development of their urine test and an additional 1,055 specimens (162 from healthy individuals, 484 from patients with prostate cancer before surgery, and 409 after surgery) to validate the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the performance evaluation phase of testing, the scientists also studied samples from patients with BPH or prostatitis, and healthy controls, from Johns Hopkins Hospital from 2022 to 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators extracted RNA from prostate cells shed in 50-ml urine samples and analyzed them using RNA sequencing and also real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to study gene expression. They also used immunohistochemistry to study biomarkers in samples from cancerous prostate tissue and healthy adjacent tissue, and statistical analyses to compare biomarkers found in the urine and tissue samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an initial 815 prostate-specific genes identified in urine from men with prostate cancers, the investigators prioritized the top 50 genes, then the top nine, and from there selected the three top performers—TTC3, H4C5, and EPCAM—for further analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, expression levels of the three biomarkers were significantly higher in urine samples from individuals with prostate cancers than in urine from the healthy controls. The expression of each biomarker diminished to low or undetectable levels in samples taken after surgery. A greater proportion of patients with prostate cancer tested positive for the three biomarkers than for PCA3, another biomarker associated with prostate cancers, in both the development study and the validation study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This test has the potential to help physicians improve diagnostic accuracy of prostate cancer, reducing unnecessary interventions while allowing &lt;a href="https://www.futurity.org/advanced-prostate-cancer-radioactive-molecules-2578992-2/"&gt;early treatment&lt;/a&gt; for those who need it,” says study coauthor Vipul Patel, director of urologic oncology at AdventHealth Cancer Institute in Celebration, Florida. Patel also is medical director of global robotics for AdventHealth’s Global Robotics Institute, and founder of the International Prostate Cancer Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On behalf of physicians and patient globally, I advocate for further study and progress for these biomarkers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators are considering how the biomarker panel could be used alone or combined with a PSA test to make a “super PSA,” Perera says. The next steps for the research are to have an independent trial of the test at another institution and to further develop the test for laboratory use in clinical settings, he says. The investigators have filed a patent, and Johns Hopkins Technology Ventures is helping the team to spin off a company.&lt;/p&gt;

The most popular ingredients for loaded water include coconut water, electrolyte powders, prebiotic sodas, and fresh fruit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-9" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Loaded water: Pros &amp;amp; Cons&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietitian Fiorella DiCarlo believes that loaded water is a healthier alternative to sodas and juices, which often contain lots of sugar and calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-10" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Loaded water offers flavour with fewer calories, less sugar and no artificial additives if made thoughtfully,” DiCarlo told The Post, noting that extra electrolytes can help the body recover after a workout by replacing essential minerals lost through sweat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-11" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, she said, for people who aren’t exercising intensely, electrolyte needs can be met through a balanced diet consisting of spinach, bananas, yoghurt, nuts and dairy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-12" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If consumed regularly without intense exercise or heavy sweating, loaded water made using pre-made electrolyte waters or mixes high in sodium, can lead to health problems like high blood pressure, kidney strain, heart troubles and muscle weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-14" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Loaded water: Homemade recipes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiorella DiCarlo said that homemade infused water can be just as effective in fighting dehydration without the added cost of commercial products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-15" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here's a general recipe for homemade loaded water you can enjoy:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take a pitcher of cool drinking water or an antioxidant-rich decaf green tea.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pick a fruit. The dietitian favours electrolyte-packed options such as watermelon, citrus fruits, lemons, or oranges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thoroughly wash and cut fruit and slice herbs to release aromatics and enhance the infusion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Steep for two to four hours in the fridge or overnight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strain fruit and herbs. DiCarlo noted that leaving ingredients in the water for too long can turn the water bitter and may also encourage bacterial growth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Store infused water in a sealed container in the refrigerator.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consume within two to three days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Loaded water: Flavoured recipe&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pineapple and coconut infusion&lt;/strong&gt;: Take 1 litre of distilled water, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.livemint.com/web-stories/5-health-benefits-of-pineapple-visual-story-11745040443714.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="pineapple"&gt;pineapple&lt;/a&gt; chunks, and 2 cups of electrolyte-rich coconut water.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watermelon and mint infusion&lt;/strong&gt;: Take 1 litre of water, 3 sprigs of fresh mint and 2 cups of seedless watermelon.

He spent plenty of time with his grandkids. He went to church regularly. And he loved the simple things, like a bowl of pasta or a sub from his favorite deli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in February 2024, everything changed. Every meal left Langevin with heartburn. He could barely eat, and even a little bit of food made him feel full. While he used to regularly eat a whole sub, now a quarter of the sandwich left him feeling full and kept him from eating for days. He was often nauseous, and he became afraid of eating because of the pain food caused him. He lost 20 pounds in three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I didn't think I was going to make it, to be honest," Langevin told CBS News. "I just wasn't feeling good at all. I'd be laying out in the sunroom on the couch most of the day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Langevin struggled to learn what was wrong with him. His general doctor "did all sorts of tests," Langevin said, including checking his liver and pancreas. Finally, in May 2024, a stomach scan revealed that he had an &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/danielle-perea-intestinal-transplant-mesenteric-ischemia/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:unusual condition called mesenteric ischemia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;unusual condition called mesenteric ischemia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. His doctor said he'd only seen it once before. Langevin had never heard of it and researching the condition filled him with fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I made the bad decision of going on Google and checking this out, and oh my gosh, I thought I had only a few years left by the way those articles were," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specialist that his primary care physician sent him to see set him straight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He said, 'Don't ever look at that stuff, just don't,'" Langevin said. "He said, 'We're going to get you through it.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is mesenteric ischemia?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mesenteric ischemia occurs when narrowed or blocked arteries restrict blood flow to the small intestine, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mesenteric-ischemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20374989?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the Mayo Clinic's website;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to the Mayo Clinic's website&lt;/a&gt;. There are two forms of mesenteric ischemia: Acute and chronic. Acute mesenteric ischemia occurs suddenly and is often caused by a blood clot, according to the Mayo Clinic. Chronic mesenteric ischemia builds up over time and usually occurs when fatty deposits build up in the arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A chronic case of the condition can become acute if left untreated, the Mayo Clinic said. The condition can cause pain, malnutrition and potentially fatal complications, including intestinal damage and organ failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;An abdominal scan shows the blockage in Ed Langevin's superior mesenteric artery. / Credit: Bluhm Cardiovascular Institute at Northwestern Medicine Palos Hospital&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Langevin had the latter form of the disease, said Dr. Gabriel Wallace, the director of vascular surgery at the Bluhm Cardiovascular Institute at Northwestern Medicine Palos Hospital. Langevin's condition was "pretty extreme," Wallace said. Patients like Langevin tend to be miserable by the time they are diagnosed, Wallace said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They can't eat, they lose weight, they start becoming malnourished, and there's a real psychiatric or psychologic detriment," Wallace said. "The psychological toll of not being able to eat, the disruption of your normal life, the pain, the fear of eating, it totally wrecks people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating mesenteric ischemia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While mesenteric ischemia is dangerous and unpleasant, it's not difficult to treat, Wallace said. He performed a minimally invasive procedure on Langevin in June 2024, placing a stent in the superior mesenteric artery. The stent holds the artery open and allows blood to flow normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surgery took less than an hour, Wallace said. Langevin was sent home the same day. He was also placed on antiplatelet medication, Wallace said. Langevin said that when he returned for his two-week check-up, he was able to eat an entire sub sandwich without any discomfort first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The stent placed in Ed Langevin's superior mesenteric artery. / Credit: Bluhm Cardiovascular Institute at Northwestern Medicine Palos Hospital&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For about a year, everything went well. In March 2025, Langevin began feeling bloating and discomfort after eating again. He returned to Wallace. A scan found that some scarring from the first surgery was compressing the stent. Wallace said it was not an uncommon complication and he performed a second procedure that extended the stent. Langevin will continue to receive regular follow-up care to ensure that the condition is correctly managed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting back to normal  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, about six months out from his follow-up surgery, Langevin is back to his old self. Steaks, pasta and sandwiches are back on the menu. He has gained back most of the weight he lost and is back to spending plenty of time with his grandkids. He and his wife are planning to travel to Rome in November as part of a pilgrimage with his local church. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm doing really good. I'm feeling normal," Langevin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Ed Langevin and his wife at an area restaurant. / Credit: Ed Langevin&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Langevin told CBS News that he hopes his story reminds others of the importance of advocating for themselves in a healthcare setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just don't give up," Langevin said. If you find a doctor that's given up on you, find another one, but just don't give up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/webcams-in-the-wild-windows-into-nature-that-soothe-the-soul?ftag=YHFaf537c7" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:Webcams in the wild: Windows into nature that "soothe the soul";elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Webcams in the wild: Windows into nature that "soothe the soul"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/softly-as-i-leave-you-priscilla-presley-writes-about-her-life-after-elvis?ftag=YHFaf537c7" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:"Softly, as I Leave You": Priscilla Presley writes about her life after Elvis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;"Softly, as I Leave You": Priscilla Presley writes about her life after Elvis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/season-58-coming-60-minutes-video-2025-09-21?ftag=YHFaf537c7" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:New season of 60 Minutes starts Sunday, Sept. 28.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;New season of 60 Minutes starts Sunday, Sept. 28.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 16:10:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE04MFBQaUREVlZVcUYycXQ3NWhHM3FqYXB6NFNIVDlyY2Z5R3htYTZseXZYVEd6dGtwVklRWXFiem9JcklqN2tIR0l1SG1zUGl3cTAxMlJDcGtQTzJua1FBUjBfNjRGeXRlSHZvU0ROYnl5OE9rSlBYZ1lDMnRuZw</guid></item><item><title>俄勒冈州农村产科病房关闭标志着在即将到来的医疗补助削减中更广泛的威胁- OregonLive.com</title><link>https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2025/09/maternity-ward-closure-in-rural-oregon-signals-wider-threat-amid-looming-medicaid-cuts.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JWWOWVTOPBEJVLRMSYIUA2K6BM"&gt;It was the middle of the night on April 2, 2024, when Teela Banister went into labor. She and her husband raced out the door of their rural home on the outskirts of Baker City in eastern Oregon, hoping to make the hour-long journey to a hospital before she delivered their daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ISIIC3KARBF5HDZZGPN7A23KXE"&gt;They could not go to the hospital just 15 minutes away, Saint Alphonsus Medical Center, which shuttered its labor and delivery unit in August 2023 — weeks before the couple found out they were expecting a second child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2FZPZOBFTNBTZDAQZFE3CW5FGU"&gt;Banister, 25, dreaded the prospect of giving birth without the Baker City obstetrics program. An aspiring labor and delivery nurse herself, she knew being so far from a hospital was risky, especially given how quickly she gave birth to their first child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JPXP463BGNCKVLILZS2QLUMK5M"&gt;“My biggest fear … was that I was going to give birth on the highway driving to the hospital,” Banister recalled to InvestigateWest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BJ5IG5BY3FD53J2MZTRRGCVSQE"&gt;That fear ultimately came to pass. She and her husband only made it 20 minutes into the drive north to a hospital in La Grande before she felt her water break.

Both plans pay providers significantly less than commercial insurers, the Hospital Association says: Medicaid in Oregon only reimburses about 56 cents for every dollar spent on a patient’s care, while Medicare pays back 82 cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-31" data-gaid="inarticle-31"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IWII5WSG7RDFFPL46DYTMZ2WV4"&gt;A high proportion of patients on Medicaid can be an indicator of a hospital’s financial vulnerability. In a &lt;a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_on_rural_hospitals.pdf" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;June letter&lt;/a&gt; opposing the “Big Beautiful Bill,” U.S. Senate Democrats used this metric to identify rural hospitals across the country that could be financially devastated by Medicaid cutbacks, putting them “at-risk” of service cuts or closure.

But as the head of a small, independently owned medical center serving roughly 8,000 people in rural northeastern Oregon, Grigg understands the difficult decisions some hospitals may make to cut or reduce high-cost services like obstetrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-43" data-gaid="inarticle-43"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KTLI45XL2RDBZESNKPBTDQNEBY"&gt;“When it comes between closing a hospital and closing a service,” Grigg said, “you’re always going to close the service before you close the hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-44" data-gaid="inarticle-44"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-heading"&gt;Growing maternity care deserts &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-45" data-gaid="inarticle-45"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3HNIYANVCJFSDBXUZ56WBPMNRU"&gt;Maternity care has increasingly been on the receiving end of cutbacks as hospitals try to stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-46" data-gaid="inarticle-46"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QHGT47OL3RD7TOX4JVQDD7BUMY"&gt;Since 2010, more than 500 hospitals in the U.S. closed their obstetrics units, leaving more than half of all rural hospitals and a third of all urban hospitals without the service, according to a study published in the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2827543" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;medical journal JAMA&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-47" data-gaid="inarticle-47"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="E544XQAFYJATPCHJ73STJOPK64"&gt;Kozhimannil, who was a lead author on the study, says there are a few reasons why a hospital might decide to shutter a maternity ward, but they all boil down to a question of resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-48" data-gaid="inarticle-48"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5Y3J3WGAQNCTZB6ZP3OG57ZX5U"&gt;Like emergency rooms, labor and delivery units need to be staffed 24/7 in the event they receive a patient in the middle of childbirth. This means hospitals need to have obstetricians, labor and delivery nurses, anesthesiologists and neonatologists regularly on-call — positions that are highly specialized and difficult to hire for, especially in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-49" data-gaid="inarticle-49"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KRDZLNFAWRGCHMMLNW4QHGOF2I"&gt;This round-the-clock availability also translates to higher overhead costs which hospitals are rarely able to fully recoup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-50" data-gaid="inarticle-50"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5QHJ7W5VLNEYVP7APMYNH7EBHY"&gt;For one, most simply do not receive enough patients for the department to be profitable. Kozhimannil says the average hospital needs about 200 births annually to keep their unit viable, but a third of facilities in the U.S. operate under that minimum threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-51" data-gaid="inarticle-51"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="A2D2UEE7Z5ELDEEG35HFEK2AK4"&gt;“We do about 50 deliveries a year and so we’re only getting paid 50 payments for those deliveries,” said Grigg, the CEO of Wallowa Memorial. “If you do 1,000 deliveries with the same standby cost, you’re getting that payment a thousand times over.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-52" data-gaid="inarticle-52"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TG2NGHJOQBCV7H3EKHJRSDTYMA"&gt;Even then, most payments from insurance don’t cover the full cost of care for childbirth. For instance, the average reimbursement the Oregon Health Plan &lt;a href="https://www.oregon.gov/oha/HPA/ANALYTICS/Pages/Hospital-Payment-Report.aspx" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;gave to hospitals in 2023&lt;/a&gt; for a complication-free, vaginal delivery was about $8,521. The average cost for this kind of delivery in the U.S. is about $15,712, per the &lt;a href="https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/health-costs-associated-with-pregnancy-childbirth-and-postpartum-care/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker&lt;/a&gt;, an initiative monitoring healthcare costs and quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-53" data-gaid="inarticle-53"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VX3FXWWNIFFHBFJUPPB7UEZKZE"&gt;“If the overall organization is still profitable … you can absorb those financial losses,” said Davis, the CEO of Grande Ronde Hospital. “If the organization has multiple years of financial losses, now all of a sudden, your criteria and the lens has changed to where you’ve got to start looking at an individual department level or service line level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-54" data-gaid="inarticle-54"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DWC7Y4XUKVCSZMKRJDSMQZBH24"&gt;When a hospital closes an obstetrics unit, expectant mothers often end up traveling farther to reach the closest hospital, not only for labor and delivery but also for care related to potential complications and postpartum recovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-55" data-gaid="inarticle-55"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2CFP5GP2C5E2PJZOP7BONVBJ5I"&gt;Studies have found this added distance lends itself to more births in riskier settings like emergency rooms, at home or in vehicles, as well as higher numbers of pre-term births.

Anticipating an influx of patients from Baker City, the medical center hired on extra obstetrics nurses and trained their emergency room staff and first responders about what to do in the event a laboring woman cannot reach the hospital, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-57" data-gaid="inarticle-57"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UJFKO6R2KNEEBOQ2OYQMHNH4AU"&gt;“Minutes matter and they really do make the difference between a mother going home with a baby in her arms and a mother going home with empty arms,” said Amanda Vinson, a registered nurse at Samaritan Lebanon’s Girod Birth Center and member of the Oregon Nurses Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-58" data-gaid="inarticle-58"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HBZMWWMLK5C7JI77IMUFGTTS4M"&gt;The loss of a birth center can additionally lead to decreases in the availability of other kinds of reproductive health care, like postpartum mental health support, doula and midwife services and gynecological surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-59" data-gaid="inarticle-59"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YZLHXVPAGVEZZKTZLUFH475AF4"&gt;“When a hospital stops providing obstetric services, those risks do not go away,” Kozhimannil said. “Those risks are still there, they’re just not borne by the hospital any more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-60" data-gaid="inarticle-60"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-heading"&gt;Accessing care where it isn’t&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-61" data-gaid="inarticle-61"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="65PINFNQPRF5ZEXGCBTQTK7GH4"&gt;When Baker City’s birth center shuttered, Shelley Payton, a local doula, tried to fill in the gap that was left. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-62" data-gaid="inarticle-62"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZXMNZIR6LRF2HIQQBTGQXAZHK4"&gt;Her role had always been to support her clients through birth by facilitating communication with their care team and providing an extra set of hands wherever necessary.

Situated at the foot of Rock Creek Butte, the tallest peak in the Blue Mountains range, just one major highway links the town to La Grande to the west and Boise, Idaho to the east — Interstate 84.

The average household income in Baker County is about $58,000 a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-65" data-gaid="inarticle-65"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="G42UNHORPBGQLJGVOPEXM7XPVY"&gt;One woman who ended up going to the emergency room at Saint Alphonsus told Payton the doctors there missed that she was experiencing preeclampsia — a condition involving persistent high blood pressure that can lead to serious issues for both the mother and baby if left untreated. The woman only got that diagnosis a few days later, when she was able to make it to La Grande, according to the doula. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-66" data-gaid="inarticle-66"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7WQ42X4NTZG75OPYIADRMSWNFY"&gt;Payton said other clients who went to Saint Alphonsus’ emergency room for possible pregnancy complications were told they could not be treated there and would need to be transported via ambulance or helicopter elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-67" data-gaid="inarticle-67"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PMAV4NFRARE4VJBAS4IV3DKZWY"&gt;The closure even impacted other areas of care. A mother of three told InvestigateWest she developed severe anemia after she was unable to get a timely procedure to address “uncontrollable” menstrual bleeding because Saint Alphonsus no longer provided the service in Baker City.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wounds that do not heal are often caused by bacterial infections and are particularly dangerous for the elderly and people with diabetes, cancer and other conditions. Acetic acid (more commonly known as vinegar) has been used for centuries as a disinfectant, but it is only effective against a small number of bacteria, and it does not kill the most dangerous types.&lt;/p&gt;


										    
																																	&lt;p&gt;New research led by researchers at University of Bergen in Norway, QIMR Berghofer and Flinders University in Australia has resulted in the ability to boost the natural bacterial killing qualities of vinegar by adding antimicrobial nanoparticles made from carbon and cobalt. The findings have been published in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.5c03108" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular biologists Dr. Adam Truskewycz and Professor Nils Halberg found these particles could kill several dangerous bacterial species, and their activity was enhanced when added to a weak vinegar solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the study, Dr. Truskewycz and Professor Halberg added cobalt-containing carbon quantum dot nanoparticles to weak &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/acetic+acid/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;acetic acid&lt;/a&gt; (vinegar) to create a potent antimicrobial treatment. They used this mixture against several pathogenic species, including the drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Enterococcus faecalis.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;figcaption class="text-darken text-low-up mt-4" itemprop="caption"&gt;Vinegar and cobalt-containing nanoparticles—animation. Credit: QIMR Berghofer&lt;/figcaption&gt;  
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Truskewycz said the acidic environment from the vinegar made &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/bacterial+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bacterial cells&lt;/a&gt; swell and take up the nanoparticle treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Once exposed, the nanoparticles appear to attack dangerous bacteria from both inside the bacterial cell and also on its surface, causing them to burst. Importantly, this approach is nontoxic to &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/human+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human cells&lt;/a&gt; and was shown to remove bacterial infections from mice wounds without affecting healing," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antibacterial boost in &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/vinegar/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;vinegar&lt;/a&gt; found in the study could potentially be an important contribution toward the ongoing battle against the rising antimicrobial resistance levels worldwide, with an estimated 4.5 million deaths associated with a direct infectious disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Halberg said this study showed how &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/nanoparticles/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;nanoparticles&lt;/a&gt; could be used to increase the effectiveness of traditional bacterial treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Combination treatments such as the ones highlighted in this study may help to curb antimicrobial resistance. Given this issue can kill up to 5 million people each year, it's vital we look to find new ways of killing pathogens like viruses, bacteria and fungi or parasites," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In A Nutshell&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A large-scale study of over 6 million couples across Taiwan, Denmark, and Sweden found that partners are more likely to share the same or similar psychiatric diagnoses.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Conditions analyzed included depression, anxiety, ADHD, autism, bipolar disorder, OCD, anorexia, schizophrenia, and substance use disorder.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The findings suggest “assortative mating,” or how people often choose partners with similar traits and life experiences, may extend into mental health.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Other explanations include shared environments, attachment styles, and social identity factors that foster closeness and mutual understanding.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Researchers caution the results are observational only; timing of diagnosis and doctor bias may influence outcomes, and the study does not measure relationship quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Birds of a feather flock together” is a cliche for a reason when it comes to romantic relationships. Shared religious beliefs, values, &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/pspi0000467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;political affiliation&lt;/a&gt; and even music taste all &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0129688" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;influence attraction&lt;/a&gt; and satisfaction in a relationship. But a recent study has now identified another unexpected factor that may bring couples closer together: sharing a similar mental health diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The concept of romantic partners sharing a psychiatric diagnosis is not new. Indeed, between &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/mental-disorders-in-married-couples-assortative-mating/B021C0E81DD730C802612CDA65BA809D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;1964&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/mates-of-schizophrenic-mothers/ABC12CEE463EEF7DECFC2CF608A84B9A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;1985&lt;/a&gt; several studies that explored the reasons why people choose their romantic partners included &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/assortative-mating-among-inpatients-with-primary-affective-disorder/17CA2893AB36365CF334CBDDB17DCD89" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;psychiatric diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; as a variable. However, no large-scale, cross-cultural investigation had been conducted until recently.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using national health insurance data from more than six million couples in total, a team of researchers recently analyzed the degree to which psychiatric disorders were &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-025-02298-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shared between couples&lt;/a&gt;. They examined data from five million couples in Taiwan, 571,534 couples in Denmark and 707,263 couples in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They looked at nine psychiatric disorders in their analysis, including &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/young-adults-adhd-substance-abuse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;substance-use disorder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/bipolar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anorexia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anorexia nervosa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/adhd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/autism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/ocd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;obsessive-compulsive disorder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/schizophrenia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;. They found that people with a diagnosed psychiatric disorder had a higher likelihood of marrying someone with the same or a similar psychiatric disorder than they did of marrying someone who isn’t diagnosed with one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the finding is robust, the authors do acknowledge there are some limitations when interpreting the results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first is that the timing of relationships and diagnoses were not recorded. This means that diagnosis could have occurred after the beginning of the relationship – and thus may not be the result of active choice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a care provider’s &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10597-020-00590-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;own biases&lt;/a&gt; may influence how likely they are to diagnose a person with a specific mental health condition. Since many couples share the same family doctor, this could influence their likelihood of being diagnosed with a psychiatric condition — and could have biased the results seen in the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, the authors stress their results are purely observational. This means they don’t explicitly consider the contributing factors as to why people with psychiatric diagnoses might be more likely to choose &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;romantic relationships&lt;/a&gt; with each other.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, there are several psychological theories that may help to explain this phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-this-phenomenon"&gt;Understanding This Phenomenon&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Assortative mating:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This theory assumes that we choose partners who are &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/ebs0000342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;similar to us&lt;/a&gt;. Normally this is applied to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2019.109739" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;personality and social factors&lt;/a&gt; (such as shared religious or socioeconomic background). But this recent study suggests that this choice may extend beyond these factors and into how we think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We tend to gravitate to those we have something in common with&lt;/em&gt;, even if it’s a psychological disorder. (© Charlize D/peopleimages.com – stock.adobe.com) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So a person with a specific psychiatric disorder – such as anxiety or autism – may be drawn to someone with a similar psychiatric disorder because they share similar traits, values or approaches to daily life (such as prioritizing &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.01.010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;structure and routine&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Proximity:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-8721.00154" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mere exposure effect&lt;/a&gt;, we often choose relationships with people that we live or work in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4324/9780367198459-REPRW43-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;close proximity to&lt;/a&gt; – or otherwise spend time around.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People who share psychiatric diagnoses may be drawn to similar social situations. For example, people with substance use disorder may visit bars or other social settings where taking substances is more commonplace – and thus may be more likely to meet potential mates who are struggling with a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2174/1874473708666150916112913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;similar disorder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Attachment theory:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/abs/bowlbyainsworth-attachment-theory/6D35C7A344107195D97FD7ADAE06C807" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Attachment theory&lt;/a&gt; assumes that as infants, we develop a specific emotional bond to our primary caregivers. This early bond then shapes our subsequent emotional and psychological patterns of behavior as we get older – and also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2011.00723.x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;influences what we’re looking for&lt;/a&gt; in a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So someone with an anxious &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/attachment-style/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;attachment style&lt;/a&gt; (which can manifest as fear of abandonment, desire for closeness or need for reassurance) might feel drawn to a partner who has a similar attachment style or exhibits the kind of behavior they desire – such as a partner who texts them all night when they’re apart. Even if this is not a healthy dynamic, the validation gained from a high-intensity relationship would likely make it hard to resist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research shows certain attachment styles are more common in people with specific psychiatric conditions. For example, anxious attachment style is more common in people who have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2991/assehr.k.200826.207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ajol.info/index.php/sajpsyc/article/view/287901" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt;. This might help explain why the study found people with certain psychiatric conditions were more likely to be married to each other.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Social identity theory:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780203505984-16/social-identity-theory-intergroup-behavior-henri-tajfel-john-turner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Social identity theory&lt;/a&gt; assumes that our self-esteem is gained through a sense of belonging within our social groups. So when you begin a relationship with somebody from within your social group, it boosts &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/self-esteem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;self-esteem&lt;/a&gt; as it brings a greater sense of belonging and feeling understood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This might explain why people with the same psychiatric diagnosis (a social group) would be drawn to each other. Finding someone who understands and experiences the same struggles you do could help you bond and make you feel understood and validated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for us? Well, the results reported by this recent study can only tell us whether couples share psychiatric diagnoses. They don’t tell us the quality and duration of the relationship, nor do they account for individual differences which may also affect the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, shared experiences &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-020-04790-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;promote closeness&lt;/a&gt; and empathetic communication for couples – and it stands to reason that this would extend to psychiatric diagnosis. Having a partner who understands and can relate to your mental illness can provide social support and validation that’s not available from someone who has never struggled with their &lt;a href="https://journals.co.za/doi/abs/10.4102/curationis.v42i1.2015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The answer depends on a mix of physical, emotional, and situational factors. While it’s often said that women can go multiple rounds more easily than men, the reality is more nuanced and deeply individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why, it helps to know a bit about the &lt;u&gt;refractory period&lt;/u&gt;, the time after pleasure when the body needs to recover before becoming aroused again. For men, this pause is typically marked by an inability to get another arousal. For women, the signs (and the timeline) are far less predictable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some women may be ready for another round of intimacy just seconds after climax. Others might feel too physically sensitive for a while, or simply feel satisfied and uninterested in continuing. A woman’s response can vary based on her physiology, her mood, her level of emotional connection with her partner, and even how intense the first pleasure was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand how women feel about going for round two, we surveyed 120 people. Here’s what they had to say, along with what science tells us about the female refractory period, and how it compares to men’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do Women Have a Refractory Period?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.issm.info/sexual-health-qa/what-are-multiple-orgasms-how-common-are-they/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:International Society for Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;International Society for Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, most women have the capacity to have multiple times of pleasure, suggesting a short or non-existent refractory period, but only about 15 percent of women do, according to past research conducted on the topic. Men, on the other hand, have refractory periods that can be as short as a few minutes for some, but up to 24 hours for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one small &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224499.2013.867922?journalCode=hjsr20" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2014 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2014 study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researchers sought to explore gender-based differences in the pleasure experience. They had 38 men and 38 women bring themselves to pleasure via solo time while being monitored. The research revealed that after pleasure, the men’s arousal and desire dropped faster and more consistently than women’s, the men were more likely than women to feel completely satisfied, and the male genital temperature decreased more than that of the women’s. On the other hand, women’s feelings of arousal and desire after pleasure persisted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235884427_Evolving_ideas_about_male_refractory_period" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2013 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2013 study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; proposed that hormone-like secretions called prostaglandins and a peptide called somatostatin may lengthen a man’s refractory period post-climax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, not all women feel ready to go again right away. An older &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288131749_Reconsidering_the_refractory_period_An_exploratory_study_of_women%27s_post-orgasmic_experiences" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2009 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2009 study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of 174 women revealed that 96 percent of the participants did not want more stimulation after pleasure due to increased sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Emotions May Affect the Female Refractory Period&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts say that emotional factors may influence a woman’s desire for multiple rounds of intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rhiannon-john-sexologist" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rhiannon John;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rhiannon John&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a specialist and intimacy educator, women’s individual experiences with a refractory period can vary widely. “While some may feel the need for a brief pause to recover or refocus, this is usually influenced more by mental or emotional factors than by physical limitations,” says John. She points to research by intimacy therapy pioneer Helen Singer Kaplan, who posited that desire and arousal often depend on emotional and situational factors, which can influence whether someone feels ready to continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaplan is probably best known for proposing the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3555026/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:three-stage female intimacy response cycle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;three-stage female intimacy response cycle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 1979. This model introduced desire as a necessary precursor to intimacy excitement and pleasure, whereas the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bjpsych-advances/article/masters-johnson-their-unique-contribution-to-sexology/7D0F859B47D0EB589C21E37EFFABD597" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:earlier model;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;earlier model&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by intimacy researchers William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson listed excitement as the first stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another theory &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/009262300278641" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:developed by Rosemary Basson in 2000;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;developed by Rosemary Basson in 2000&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; deems the intimacy response cycle in women to be cyclical and strongly influenced by a desire for intimacy. While a man’s desire for intimate activity is said to be driven by his &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.hims.com/guides/sex-drive" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:libido;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;libido&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Basson proposed that desire in a woman can be triggered after physical contact has been initiated or by her need for closeness and commitment to her partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Do Women Feel About Round 2?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on an informal poll we conducted of 120 men and women, 73 percent of respondents said women did want a second round. Twenty-seven percent said they typically felt satisfied after one round and preferred not to continue right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the poll did not factor in age, stress levels, and intensity of the first pleasure, all of which are elements that might influence a woman’s desire for multiple rounds of intimacy. Her answer may also depend on the time of day, day of the week, and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most effective way to know if your partner is interested in continuing? Open, respectful communication. After all, &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9153093/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; show couples who talk about intimacy regularly have better intimate lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tips for Shortening the Length of Time Between Times of Pleasure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re a man or a woman, there are some strategies that could potentially &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.hims.com/blog/refractory-period-how-to-shorten" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:shorten the refractory period;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;shorten the refractory period&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and increase the likelihood that you can (and want to) go for multiple rounds of intimacy. This can be especially helpful if you’re a man struggling with PE or other performance issues. If you’re concerned about not reaching pleasure together the first time, these strategies might help extend the experience—or support another round when you’re both ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Start with &lt;span&gt;pre-play&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; Take your time to build arousal again by engaging in &lt;span&gt;pre-play&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.hims.com/blog/foreplay-ideas" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk: ideas;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt; ideas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; like kissing, cuddling, watching porn, or role-play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Explore other parts of the body. &lt;/b&gt;If you find that your privates are too sensitive for stimulation after pleasure, try exploring other parts of the body to ease back into intimacy. Various hotspots all over the body, known as &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.hims.com/blog/erogenous-zones" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:erogenous zones;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;erogenous zones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, can induce pleasure when touched. Some lesser-known erogenous zones? Earlobes, inner thighs, and even the armpits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Try a new position.&lt;/b&gt; Different intimacy&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.hims.com/blog/best-sex-positions" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk: positions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt; positions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; offer different sensations. You may be able to speed up the refractory period and get sufficiently aroused again by trying a new position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Avoid excess alcohol consumption.&lt;/b&gt; Watching how much you drink isn’t just solid medical advice. It can also improve your intimate health. As a central nervous system depressant, alcohol &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10155345" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:slows brain function and blood flow;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;slows brain function and blood flow&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This can reduce stimulation and lead to difficulty in achieving pleasure. Excessive alcohol use is also &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.hims.com/blog/whiskey-dick-explained" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:linked to certain dysfunctions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;linked to certain dysfunctions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; like ED and low drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take ED medication.&lt;/b&gt; If you’ve been prescribed ED medication, you may notice that your refractory period is shorter than usual. However, you should never take &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.hims.com/erectile-dysfunction" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ED medication;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ED medication&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recreationally or without a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use adult toys.&lt;/b&gt; Toys can help extend pleasure or ease back into arousal, especially if your body needs a little more recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take care of your overall health. &lt;/b&gt;Following a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and getting enough sleep aren’t just best practices for protecting your overall health. They also boost intimacy function by supporting proper blood flow, which is crucial for arousal and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A Final Word on How to Have Multiple Rounds of Intimacy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re unsure how long to wait for round 2, your best bet is to ask your partner. The refractory period varies widely, and whether or not a woman wants to go for a second round may differ day by day. Here’s what we know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Female refractory periods vary.&lt;/b&gt; Women typically have a shorter refractory period than men, allowing for the possibility of multiple times of pleasure. However, individual experiences vary, and the best way to know if she wants to go for another round is to ask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emotional and situational factors may influence her desire.&lt;/b&gt; A need for intimacy and connection can strongly influence a woman’s readiness for multiple rounds of intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You may be able to shorten the refractory period.&lt;/b&gt; Some tips to shorten the refractory period are to engage in &lt;span&gt;pre-play&lt;/span&gt;, try new positions, and avoid excessive alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Like MediaFeed’s content? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/channel/source/Mediafeed/sr-vid-ckv6hf6hjif65e0cjnm83s7yb2y0w5xmun0j4refire0ev6727is" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Be sure to follow us;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be sure to follow us&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This article originally appeared on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hims.com/blog/how-long-for-women-round-2#how-do-women-feel-about-round-2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hims.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;span class="s3"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hims.com&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; and was syndicated by &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://mediafeed.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:MediaFeed.org;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;span class="s3"&gt;&lt;i&gt;MediaFeed.org&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 15:10:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTFBFX2ltN2g3dVdMeFdpaHFlck1fTEJTUTdZVHJVb01pTDRGbWo2VERlZWpZb3dPaEtxOW1rUFJsZVBwMEhpQWZkTWhON0lmTXNtYkFGRlBJb2s3NExFUzFRMUQ1NklmMC1CNzduRVJBLTg3TVQ1QVozVGNHdnoyeWs</guid></item><item><title>向后走可能是最奇怪的健康技巧- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/walking-backwards-might-weirdest-health-143300869.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people head into the gym ready to lift, run, or maybe squeeze in a set of lunges. What you don’t usually expect to see is someone walking backward with total focus, step after step, as if they’ve hit rewind on their workout. It looks odd at first glance—almost like a mistake—yet it’s catching on in surprising places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What seems like a quirky stunt is actually turning into a smart fitness strategy. Trainers, therapists, and everyday gym-goers are discovering that moving in reverse challenges the body in ways forward walking can’t. And as more research highlights the benefits, this strange-looking practice is starting to earn a spot alongside more traditional exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Muscles, Joints, and Calorie Burn&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image via iStockphoto/doble-d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retro walking, as experts call it, flips the movement pattern your body has mastered. It's a small change that has a surprising mix of physical and mental payoffs. Scientists at UCLA have found that walking backwards activates the prefrontal cortex, the brain’s control center for memory and decision-making. A Harvard-trained neuroscientist has recently taken it a step further by linking backward steps to sharper focus and faster recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you're walking backward, instead of your quads absorbing each step with a heel strike, the motion changes to a toe-to-heel roll. This activates the hamstrings, calves, and stabilizers in new ways. Therapists now recommend it for knee rehab because the altered load on the joints helps build quad strength while reducing strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also easier on the hips and spine. Researchers tracking muscle activation patterns found that reverse walking engages muscles that support the lower back, while stretching tight hamstrings. People with chronic back pain have reported reduced discomfort after adding it into their routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you’re chasing calorie burn, the numbers are in your favor. Walking backwards increases energy use by close to 40 percent compared with forward walking at the same pace, according to published metabolic data. Treadmill studies confirm it, too, that at the same speed, you’ll burn more in less time, and climbing in reverse magnifies the effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Balance, Focus, and Brain Gains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking backward puts your balance to the test. Without the usual visual cues to guide you, your body has to rely more on proprioception—your built-in sense of where you are in space. That extra challenge sharpens coordination and stability, which is why athletes in sports like soccer and tennis often practice reverse drills. The payoff? Better focus, improved footwork, and a reduced risk of falls or ankle sprains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For older adults, such training can strengthen stabilizing muscles and improve gait speed, which translates into better confidence when moving around day to day. The brain gets its own workout, too. By disrupting the routine rhythm of walking, retro steps require active concentration. Studies have linked this to faster reaction times and improved problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even short sessions, about ten to fifteen minutes, have been shown to boost cognitive activity. Neuroscientists suggest the novelty of the movement creates fresh neural connections, which could help preserve memory and executive function as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Add It to Your Routine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image via Canva/ Aflo Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start slow and stay safe. Reverse walking outdoors comes with the obvious risk of tripping, so treadmills or clear hallways are better for beginners. Experts recommend beginning with a slow pace, keeping the chest upright, and reaching back with the toes before rolling through to the heel. Using handrails at first is smart until the movement feels natural. Start with five-minute intervals and work toward twenty minutes once or twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 14:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTFBJODBOa0ZlLXZ1Z05BV1NrSUZSb0pGcFVISXdQekRBbWpOWDVzWndfX3d3N2htUEJYSERYQ3BYb0MtMGpwcC12MWZuS2hVWHFtd0JnazJ0TnVvU3pxWEJRVXEweVBrc1RGekxHeGRNbVNRY08xZE1GR0s2algxN0k</guid></item><item><title>自闭症报告准备、新冠肺炎疫情高峰、不良ACIP头条新闻、跌倒和孤独攀登等-您当地的流行病学家</title><link>https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/autism-report-prep-covid-peaking</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Your Local Epidemiologist</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 13:46:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxOZzdvMkpsQmdhQUp0LVAwQ29PbmxUVmVBQldHeTN0aE4wR2c3SnhSYjVFTWxmSjdYdFkyQTNzNWVGWEtnOERscWh6NFpVbWdpVGdmV0U3SlRHVmx5U0hZSjI4Vm9xazNZOU5nNy1COUpZTVRIR01PdFBodXU2NHFMdWhXYUlXZw</guid></item><item><title>研究中与自闭症相关的妊娠糖尿病：科学家们的看法-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03024-5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03024-5/d41586-025-03024-5_51456732.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03024-5/d41586-025-03024-5_51456732.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Close up of a pregnant woman holding her stomach." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03024-5/d41586-025-03024-5_51456732.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Gestational diabetes can have long-term effects on women’s health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Yui Mok/PA Images via Alamy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, a study involving more than nine million pregnancies reported that children whose mothers had gestational diabetes during pregnancy had a higher chance of developing attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism than did children whose mothers didn’t have the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, presented at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes in Vienna, is under review at a peer-reviewed journal. It is not the first to link gestational diabetes to neurodevelopmental disorders in children, but it is one of the largest. Researchers pooled results from 48 studies across 20 countries, finding that children born to people with gestational diabetes had lower IQ scores, a 36% higher risk of ADHD and a 56% higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. Estimates suggest the prevalence of autism in the general population is one in 127 people&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and between 3-10%&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of children and teenagers have ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest results mirror those of another meta-analysis&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; published in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet Diabetes &amp;amp; Endocrinology&lt;/i&gt; journal in June, which included 56 million mother–child pairs and found that all types of diabetes in pregnancy, including type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes, increase the risk of the baby developing ADHD and autism. But none of these studies have been able to show that diabetes during pregnancy causes these conditions. “There’s no doubt that there is a signal here, but certainly further research is required,” says Alex Polyakov, an obstetrician and researcher at the University of Melbourne in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long a topic of research, the causes of autism have been thrust into the spotlight by the administration of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02636-1#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02636-1#ref-CR4" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;US President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;. On Sunday, while speaking at the memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Trump said: “I think we found an answer to autism. How about that?” &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/21/trump-autism-announcement-tylenol-leucovorin/" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/21/trump-autism-announcement-tylenol-leucovorin/" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Trump’s administration is poised to announce a link between autism and the use of acetaminophen, also called paracetamol, during pregnancy. &lt;a href="https://www.nps.org.au/assets/f4cd8a064d47b62a-0e01df33044e-139fddfcb7c79fd0c38a7065fad62081b237334047fed3a63e4463e31f34.pdf" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nps.org.au/assets/f4cd8a064d47b62a-0e01df33044e-139fddfcb7c79fd0c38a7065fad62081b237334047fed3a63e4463e31f34.pdf" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Medical guidelines&lt;/a&gt; say acetominophen is safe to use during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, genetics has the strongest influence on the risk of developing ADHD and autism. Environmental factors, such as folic-acid deficiency, air pollution and gestational diabetes, have a small-to-moderate effect on the risk of these conditions, says Ling-Jun Li, a clinician–scientist at the National University of Singapore and a co-author on the latest gestational diabetes study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polyakov agrees: “In practice, both genetic predisposition and environmental factors likely interact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Health impacts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies over the past two decades&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; have shown that gestational diabetes has long-term effects on women’s health, such as increasing their risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke and chronic kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Li and her colleagues decided to review the evidence for effects of the condition on neurocognitive development in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CITYWIDE — Local health officials are urging Chicagoans to get vaccinated against mpox amid a spike in cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There have been 81 new cases of mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, reported in Chicago over the past six months — and 90 percent of them have been diagnosed since June 10, according to the Chicago Department of Public Health. Fourteen new cases were reported Sept. 9-15 alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mpox has particularly affected gay, bisexual and same-gender-loving men in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Andrew Crone, infectious disease specialist physician at Howard Brown, said his organization’s clinic has seen the increase — and vaccination remains key to reducing the severity of illness.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“While we can and have seen cases in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, vaccination can still provide good protection and minimize the severity of the symptoms experienced if a person is infected,” Crone said in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Symptoms can range from mild to severe, including bumps or sores and significant anal pain. Anyone with symptoms should get tested and isolated until they receive a diagnosis, Crone said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-CALOR-Monkeypox-Vaccines-Colin-Boyle-7949.jpg?resize=1650%2C1098&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-560953"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Community health RN Margaret Mary Butler fills a syringe with the smallpox and mypox vaccine during a vaccination clinic at CALOR in Humboldt Park on Aug. 17, 2022. &lt;span class="image-credit"&gt;&lt;span class="credit-label-wrapper"&gt;Credit:&lt;/span&gt; Colin Boyle/Block Club Chicago&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Treatment is largely supportive care and pain management until the infection resolves. Health officials are also reminding people who only received one dose of the two-dose vaccine series to complete the series for stronger protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To combat the surge, the health department is making mpox vaccination the centerpiece of clinics this fall where people can also get flu and COVID shots. The mpox vaccine is also available at the city’s &lt;a href="https://click.citynews.chicago.gov/?qs=443e6e23c13479462e224b1cff570fae5e72a539c6d6c663ce0e21c0c2fe9157126b2f9ee77898e501bae6b25af866aa59e3620ec458eb65" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;Sexual Health Clinics&lt;/a&gt; in Lakeview, Austin and Roseland.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While anyone can get mpox, this summer’s increase has disproportionately affected sexually active gay, bisexual, and same-gender-loving men,” health department officials said in a press release. “Adding the mpox vaccine to your fall health routine is the best way to protect yourself and your community.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-does-mpox-spread"&gt;How Does Mpox Spread?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, mpox spreads through:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct contact with a person’s infectious rash, scabs or body fluids.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Respiratory secretions during prolonged face-to-face contact or intimate physical contact, such as kissing, cuddling or sex.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Touching items — like clothing or bedding — that have previously touched a person’s infectious rash or body fluids.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;From an infected pregnant person to a fetus.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Infected animals scratching, biting or being consumed.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;People can spread the virus from the time they show symptoms until their rash has fully healed. Those without symptoms cannot spread mpox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-symptoms-of-mpox"&gt;Symptoms Of Mpox&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most notable symptom is a rash that can resemble pimples or blisters, appearing on the face, hands, chest, genitals or anus. The rash can also develop internally, making it painful to eat, drink or use the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other common symptoms include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Muscle and back aches&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Swollen lymph nodes&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Chills&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Exhaustion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rash can be “excruciatingly painful,” health experts have warned. Anyone experiencing these symptoms should seek medical care and testing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/08/081722-CALOR-Monkeypox-Vaccines-Colin-Boyle-7788.jpg?resize=1650%2C1098&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-560934"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Community health RN Kristen Figueroa administers the smallpox and mpox vaccine to a patient during a vaccination clinic at CALOR in Humboldt Park on Aug. 17, 2022. &lt;span class="image-credit"&gt;&lt;span class="credit-label-wrapper"&gt;Credit:&lt;/span&gt; Colin Boyle/Block Club Chicago&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-to-do-if-you-think-you-have-mpox"&gt;What To Do If You Think You Have Mpox&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isolate from others and avoid skin-to-skin contact.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Do not share bedding, towels or other linens.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Avoid sex or intimacy until evaluated by a medical professional.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Contact a health provider or call the health department at 312-746-4835 to get connected to testing and care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-can-get-vaccinated-in-chicago"&gt;Who Can Get Vaccinated In Chicago&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are available to anyone in Illinois who fits any of these criteria:&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone who has had skin-to-skin contact with someone diagnosed with mpox.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;People who exchange sex for goods or services.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;People living with HIV, particularly those not in regular care.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;People taking or eligible for PrEP.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sexually active gay, bisexual and same-gender-loving men.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sexually active transgender people.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sexual partners of the above groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-to-get-vaccinated"&gt;Where To Get Vaccinated&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Chicago Department of Public Health has a &lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/infectious_disease/supp_info/mpox-home/mpox-vaccine.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;map of clinics where people can be vaccinated.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Howard Brown Health’s clinics also offer vaccines by appointment or walk in. &lt;a href="https://howardbrown.org/locations/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;Find a location nearest you here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

ROACH: I was diagnosed with stage 4 high-grade ovarian cancer in September 2024. I underwent a major surgery after the tumor shrank in March. I see a top doctor at a renowned hospital, and I trust him. I went through seven rounds of chemo with three different meds. I handled it well as I am very fit and 64 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IYWIR7NYBNCANAJWBCK4SAOKZM"&gt;I am now on maintenance medications (Avastin and Lynparza). My numbers are going up. I know my outlook isn’t good, but I try to live my best life. I have a lot of different things to look forward to (marriages, grandbabies, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="U2A3OS75LFBKTN776ZXHHUNQPM"&gt;I have many friends who keep suggesting ivermectin as a treatment. (These people are also anti-vaxers.) I can’t fall into this group of people as I believe in modern medicine and have trusted my doctor. So, my question is: What are your thoughts about this treatment, and what have you heard about it within the medical community? -- L.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5MP3WC3KVBAERMDAHLMUAZEJZE"&gt;ANSWER: I am sorry to hear about your diagnosis, but I congratulate you on your good attitude. The treatment for ovarian cancer has changed dramatically in the past few years. There are many treatments, and although they are often not able to cure cancer, they can keep cancer at bay -- sometimes for many years, even decades. Having an important life event to look forward to is important to maintaining a good attitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HON7EIS2TNBRFDUDUL4KIM3AKM"&gt;As far as ivermectin goes, there is a small possibility that it will turn out to be a useful treatment for cancer. I have read some preclinical studies that suggested some benefit. However, no studies that were done on actual people have proven it to be useful for any cancer so far. Many promising drugs turn out to be failures after the initial clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HQNQFWNSA5GMTOGK7UFJYEQLXM"&gt;There are people who feel that there are hidden treatments for cancer and that there is a massive conspiracy to keep successful cancer treatments from being used. Having known many doctors and research scientists who unfortunately died from cancer themselves, I can assure you that this isn’t the case. Many scientists across the globe are working hard to find new treatments, and every year brings incremental benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XCVSOSUZY5BNROVMWBACTMVATI"&gt;Ivermectin is the most recent “miracle treatment” that I have heard about. I can recall easily at least a half dozen miracle treatments in the past 20 years that haven’t turned out to be useful. Some of these are not only useless but are actively harmful.

The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Immunology&lt;/em&gt;, could lead to new immunotherapy approaches for treating cancer as well as potential treatments for inflammatory disorders and neurologic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Myeloid cells are among the first group of immune cells recruited to tumors, but very quickly these tumor-fighting cells turn into tumor-supporting cells. Our study suggests that receptors on these myeloid cells get stimulated by this hormone and end up suppressing the immune system," said Cheng Cheng "Alec" Zhang, Ph.D., Professor of Physiology and a member of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center at UT Southwestern. Dr. Zhang co-led the study with first author Xing Yang, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher in the Zhang Lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, are effective for only about 20%-30% of cancer patients, Dr. Zhang said, suggesting that there are multiple ways that cancers evade attack from the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, researchers in the Zhang Lab studying cancer-fighting immune cells called myeloid cells identified an inhibitory receptor called LILRB4. Stimulating this receptor blocked the myeloid cells' ability to attack tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Zhang, Dr. Yang, and their colleagues then did a genome-wide screen of all proteins that might interact with LILRB4. A promising hit was a hormone called SCG2. Although researchers have suggested that SCG2 plays a role in immune response, its function and receptor were unknown. Laboratory experiments confirmed that SCG2 binds to LILRB4, kicking off a signaling cascade that turned off the cancer-fighting abilities of myeloid cells and inhibited their ability to recruit cancer-fighting T cells to tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mice genetically altered to express the human form of LILRB4, injected cancer cells that produced SCG2 grew rapidly as tumors. Treating these mice with an antibody that blocks LILRB4 significantly slowed cancer growth, as did artificially ridding the animals' bodies of SCG2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these experiments suggest that interactions between LILRB4 and SCG2 allow cancer to grow unchecked by myeloid cells, T cells, and potentially other immune cell types. Dr. Zhang suggested that disrupting this interaction could someday offer a new immunotherapy option to treat cancer. Conversely, because this interaction neutralizes myeloid cells' immune activity, delivering extra SCG2 could be a promising treatment for autoimmune or inflammatory disorders spurred by myeloid cells. Dr. Zhang and his colleagues plan to investigate both ideas in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;

The findings suggest that the tendency to resonate with others’ stress—through elevated heart rate, subjective stress, and other physiological responses—may not necessarily increase vulnerability to PTSD, but may instead reflect the presence of PTSD symptoms themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that can develop after exposure to a traumatic event, such as war, violence, or forced displacement. It often involves persistent symptoms like hyperarousal, intrusive memories, emotional detachment, and disrupted sleep. Refugees and migrants who have experienced war or persecution are at particularly high risk for developing PTSD, given both the trauma they endured and the continued stress they face in the process of resettlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While not all individuals exposed to trauma develop PTSD, researchers have been working to identify factors that influence who is more likely to struggle with long-term psychological effects. One emerging area of interest is the idea of “stress resonance,” or the extent to which someone shares in another person’s emotional or physiological stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This resonance, closely related to empathy, occurs when observing another person in distress triggers similar responses in the observer’s own body and emotions. While empathy can promote connection and cooperation in social settings, some researchers have hypothesized that it could become harmful when it leads to heightened and repeated internal stress responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study explored whether heightened stress resonance could act as a vulnerability factor for PTSD, or whether it might instead be a byproduct of the disorder. The researchers focused on refugees and migrants from Arabic-speaking countries who had resettled in Germany, aiming to test whether individuals who responded more strongly to another person’s stress were more likely to experience PTSD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study was based on the idea that people differ in how much empathy they feel, and these differences may affect whether someone is more vulnerable or more resilient when facing war-related trauma,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.uniklinikum-jena.de/mpsy/Team/Mitarbeiter_innen/Mitarbeiter+auf+Planstellen+in+Forschung+und+Lehre/Christiane+Wesarg.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Christiane Wesarg-Menzel&lt;/a&gt; of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences and Friedrich-Schiller University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 67 adult participants from Arabic-speaking countries, some of whom had entered Germany as refugees and others as migrants. Refugees had fled war, violence, or persecution, while migrants had relocated for reasons such as work or study and reported no major trauma exposure. All participants observed a German-speaking individual undergo a standardized laboratory stress test known to trigger physiological and emotional stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this procedure, participants observed the stressed person through a one-way mirror as they completed tasks designed to induce social-evaluative stress, such as a mock job interview and a challenging mental arithmetic task in front of an evaluative panel. Throughout the process, researchers measured multiple indicators of stress in both the person undergoing the test and the observers. These included heart rate, heart rate variability, salivary cortisol levels, and self-reported stress ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal was to assess whether the observers’ responses matched the stress levels of the person being watched. This degree of synchronization—termed stress resonance—was calculated by comparing changes in physiological and emotional markers between the observer and the person undergoing stress. The researchers then looked at how these resonance scores related to each participant’s reported level of PTSD symptoms, measured through a validated questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers initially hypothesized that stress resonance would increase the link between trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms, suggesting it might be a trait that makes some individuals more vulnerable. However, the results did not support this idea. Instead, the analysis indicated that higher levels of stress resonance were directly associated with higher PTSD symptom severity, even when taking trauma exposure, age, and sex into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We started off with the hypothesis that people who strongly ‘pick up’ on the stress of others would be more vulnerable to developing mental health problems than those who resonate less, even if both had gone through similar traumatic experiences,” Wesarg-Menzel told PsyPost. “However, our data did not support this idea. Instead, we found that individuals reporting more severe PTSD symptoms resonated more with a stranger under stress. This was visible not only in how stressed they said they felt, but also in their heart rate and heart rate variability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, greater alignment in subjective stress, heart rate, and heart rate variability between the observer and the stressed individual was linked to more severe PTSD symptoms. Cortisol-based stress resonance, on the other hand, did not show a significant association. The authors interpret this pattern as suggesting that heightened stress resonance may be better understood as a correlate—or possible symptom—of PTSD, rather than a pre-existing risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional findings revealed that some participants exhibited such strong physiological responses while observing the stress test that their stress levels surpassed those of the individuals actually undergoing the test. This phenomenon was observed in both refugees and migrants, with no significant group differences in stress resonance across physiological markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that stress resonance was modestly related to self-reported personal distress, a trait-level measure of empathy characterized by discomfort or anxiety in response to others’ suffering. This connection adds weight to the idea that emotional sensitivity to others’ stress may play a role in how PTSD symptoms manifest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the researchers note that while trauma exposure was strongly related to PTSD symptoms, it was not linked to the degree of stress resonance. This suggests that the observed resonance effects were not merely a byproduct of trauma history alone, but rather tied more specifically to current psychological symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Refugees and migrants from Arabic-speaking countries have often been exposed to many traumatic experiences, which puts them at higher risk of developing mental health problems,” Wesarg-Menzel said. “In our study, we found that people who reported more symptoms of PTSD resonated more with a stranger undergoing a stress test. This means that their heart rate and feelings of stress rose in ways that closely mirrored the stranger’s reactions. We believe this heightened tendency to ‘take on’ another person’s stress may be a symptom of PTSD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some limitations. The cross-sectional nature of the study limits the ability to draw conclusions about causality. It remains unclear whether heightened stress resonance precedes the development of PTSD symptoms or whether it is a result of them. It is also possible that both emerge together in the aftermath of trauma. Longitudinal studies are needed to trace how stress resonance and PTSD symptoms evolve over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers aim to extend their work by examining how empathy influences mental health in adolescent refugees, with a particular focus on the roles that parents and peers may play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to expand this research into the family context,” Wesarg-Menzel said. “We are currently applying for funding to study how the empathic abilities of adolescent refugees affect their health after displacement, and how parents and peers can support their resilience. Our long-term goal is to help develop interventions that strengthen the mental health of refugees.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would like to once again thank our participants for taking part in the study, our Arabic-speaking student assistants for their support and valuable advices during data collection, and Beyond Conflict and the Max-Planck-Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig, for funding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-025-03548-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Adding to the burden: the tendency to resonate with others’ stress is linked to higher PTSD symptom severity in individuals with war-related trauma&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Christiane Wesarg-Menzel, Mathilde Gallistl, Michael Niconchuk, and Veronika Engert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 12:09:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxOLXZMODRjeDhkeGFaTUljU2cxZ095UDZQNFBFR1hoVjF2VG8ybVptNUNBdk1yS1NycDBoQWJ0bjYzT0s4c0kweFd4a1ZpVXRJYmdyVkdVMlFPTlRwdWFsNVhqQzJ3WXVKemwwcFZwc0pxQ2ZtU0FHYjNYdlRfR3R1Sm5uTGhFVUxreDczWUMxMXdYd1Z1cG9PNUduWQ</guid></item><item><title>一位胃肠病学家说，这是改善肠道健康的头号食物- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/gastroenterologist-says-number-1-food-115300776.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;15 Foods to Eat for Better Gut Health&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Mike Kemp - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a60986875/gut-health-tips/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gut microbiome;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; and its role in your overall health have been some of the fastest growing areas of nutrition research over the past decide, and for good reason: It seems that almost every system and bodily process, from your immune system, to your metabolism, to your mood, is linked to the well-being of the microscopic bacteria living in your gut.

Try adding some of these expert-approved foods to your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Best foods for gut health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Kimchi&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kimchi, fermented cabbage, is one of Gans’ top foods for improving gut health. “Fermentation results in postbiotics, non-living metabolites that provide a health benefit when consumed,” Gans said. “Research on postbiotics has shown they help balance the microbiome in our gut and maintain digestive health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Ginger&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some may complain of bloating after consuming ginger, according to Dr. Bedford, it tends to be a great food for regulating gut health (and adding some flavor to your dishes). “It cuts down on gut inflammation and fermentation, it helps in terms of bowel habit or bowel movements and contains antioxidants,” Dr. Bedford said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Black beans&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may have heard that &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/g25922606/high-fiber-low-carb-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high-fiber foods;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;high-fiber foods&lt;/a&gt; are good for your health—this is also true for your gut. “Black beans are packed with fiber, both insoluble and soluble,” said Gans. “Insoluble fiber specifically has been associated with decreasing the risk of constipation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Almonds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almonds are high in healthy fats, fiber, and protein and are a great nut option for supporting your overall health. These nuts “help to support the gut microbiome,” Dr. Bedford said, and are “definitely good for gut health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Yogurt&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gans recommended adding yogurt to your diet as it is a great option for a probiotic-rich food. “Probiotics consist of living microorganisms that help increase the good bacteria in our gut,” Gans explained. Plus, yogurt can easily be eaten as a tasty snack or added to foods like smoothies, soups, condiments, baked goods, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Bananas&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to add more fruits to your diet, Dr. Bedford recommended eating more bananas. They are high in fiber, which aids in digestion and helps you feel full for longer. Bananas also contain prebiotics, which help the good bacteria in your gut (also known as probiotics) thrive, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/author/218096/natalie-rizzo-m-s-r-d/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Natalie Rizzo, M.S., R.D.;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Natalie Rizzo, M.S., R.D.&lt;/a&gt;, previously explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. Apples&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phrase “an apple a day keeps the doctor away,” may actually have some merit. Along with bananas, apples are “definitely a good fruit for gut health,” Dr. Bedford noted, thanks to the fiber and prebiotics they contain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. Pears&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pears are another great fruit to add to your menu because they are also “a good source of fiber, specifically soluble fiber,” Gans explained. “Soluble fiber helps promote regular bowel movements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9. Asparagus&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Asparagus is a prebiotic food that is good for your gut,” Gans explained. “Prebiotics are food for the good bacteria in your gut, helping them flourish and keeping a healthy balance of the microbiome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10. Kale&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like asparagus, kale is a green leafy vegetable, which is a variety that Dr. Bedford said is “full of various vitamins and antioxidants that are certainly important to not only gut health, but also your overall health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;11. Collard greens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for more leafy greens to add to your plate, look no further than &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a34212046/collard-greens-nutrition/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:collard greens;cpos:12;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;collard greens&lt;/a&gt;. This vegetable is high in (you guessed it) fiber and has a high water content, which aids in digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;12. Salmon&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seafood lovers, rejoice. “Salmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids which have anti-inflammatory properties and may help reduce any potential inflammation in the gut,” Gans explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;13. Onions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Onions are another great prebiotic-rich food that help contribute to better gut health, according to Dr. Bedford. Plus, onions are great for adding lots of flavor to a variety of dishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;14. Sauerkraut&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever topped your hot dog with sauerkraut, you’ve been doing your gut a favor. This fermented cabbage product is a probiotic-rich food that makes for a tasty side or condiment while also protecting your gut, according to research from the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/food/news/gut-health-benefits-sauerkraut" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:University of California, Davis;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;University of California, Davis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;15. Kefir&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of kefir as yogurt’s more fermented (derived from milk) sibling. Dr. Bedford recommended this probiotic powerhouse as it aids in digestive and immune health. “Anything that is fermented is essentially a good, probiotic-friendly food,” Dr. Bedford explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are probiotics?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probiotics are “living microorganisms,” said Gans. These microorganisms are bacteria—commonly referred to as “good” bacteria. These good bacteria can be found in lots of foods (as well as &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g33704757/best-probiotic-supplements/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:probiotic supplements;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;probiotic supplements&lt;/a&gt;) and help contribute to a healthy balance of bacteria in the gut and the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are prebiotics?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a60990121/probiotics-and-prebiotics/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Prebiotics and probiotics;cpos:15;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Prebiotics and probiotics&lt;/a&gt; are actually very different—but we depend on both for optimal gut health.

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, published recently in the journal &lt;em&gt;Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;, was co-authored by researchers at Ben-Gurion University, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and the University of Leipzig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurological conditions, including mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, have been associated with a higher brain age gap -- a brain that's "older" than would be predicted given a person's chronological age. To evaluate the impact of diet on brain age, researchers analyzed data from around 300 participants in the DIRECT PLUS trial, one of the longest-running studies on the link between brain and diet. Over the course of 18 months, the participants consumed one of three diets: a standard healthy diet; a traditional calorie-restricted Mediterranean diet, which was low in simple carbohydrates, rich in vegetables, and replaced red meat with poultry and fish; and the green-Mediterranean diet, which additionally included green tea and Mankai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the researchers measured protein levels in the participants' blood, they found that higher levels of certain proteins were associated with accelerated brain aging. Further, they found that those protein levels decreased in participants who followed the green-Mediterranean diet. The researchers hypothesized that the protective effect of the diet could be a result of the anti-inflammatory molecules contained in green tea and Mankai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Studying the circulating proteins in blood allows us to observe, in a real-life setting, how the brain's aging processes are influenced by lifestyle and dietary changes," said Anat Meir, postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard Chan School, who co-led the study. "This approach gives us a dynamic window into brain health, helping to reveal biological changes long before symptoms may appear. By mapping these protein signatures, we gain powerful new insight into how interventions, such as diet, may help preserve cognitive function as we age."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior author of the study was Iris Shai, adjunct professor of nutrition at Harvard Chan School. Other Harvard Chan School co-authors included Dong Wang, Frank Hu, and Meir Stampfer.&lt;/p&gt;

The research also indicates that patients who had higher initial levels of a specific protein, called amyloid-beta 1–42, experienced greater cognitive benefits from the treatment. These findings, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-025-03492-3" target="_blank"&gt;Translational Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, point toward a potentially safe and convenient therapeutic option for individuals with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive brain disorder that gradually diminishes memory and other important mental functions. For decades, a leading theory has suggested that the buildup of proteins called amyloid-beta peptides in the brain is a primary cause of the nerve cell damage and cognitive decline seen in the disease. This idea has gained support with the recent approval of new treatments that directly target and remove these amyloid-beta proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These therapies, which are administered through intravenous infusions, have shown an ability to slow cognitive decline. However, they can be associated with side effects, including brain swelling or bleeding, and they present logistical challenges for patients and healthcare systems due to their high cost and the need for regular hospital visits for infusions and monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This situation has prompted a search for safer and more accessible treatments that can also address the amyloid-beta buildup. One candidate is sodium benzoate, a compound that is a metabolite of cinnamon and is widely used as a food preservative. It is also approved as a treatment for certain metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research provided early hints of its potential. Studies in animal models of Alzheimer’s disease showed that oral sodium benzoate could reduce the amyloid protein load in the brain and improve learning and memory. Clinical trials in humans subsequently found that daily doses of 750 milligrams or 1000 milligrams improved cognitive function in patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease, with a safety profile comparable to a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current investigation was designed as a secondary analysis of a previous trial to explore two key questions: can oral sodium benzoate lower the levels of amyloid-beta peptides in the blood of people with Alzheimer’s, and is there a connection between a patient’s initial amyloid-beta levels and their cognitive response to the treatment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, Chieh-Hsin Lin of Chang Gung University and Hsien-Yuan Lane of China Medical University Hospital in Taichung City analyzed data from a previously conducted clinical trial. The original study was a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 149 patients from three medical centers in Taiwan. The double-blind design means that neither the participants nor the investigators knew who was receiving the active treatment versus an inactive placebo, which helps prevent bias in the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were individuals between 50 and 100 years old who had been diagnosed with probable mild Alzheimer’s disease. They were generally in good physical health and had cognitive scores within a specific range that indicated a mild stage of the disease. The patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups for the 24-week period. One group received a placebo, while the other three groups received different daily doses of sodium benzoate: 500 milligrams, 750 milligrams, or 1000 milligrams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the study, researchers assessed the cognitive function of each participant using a standard test called the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale. This is a common tool used in clinical trials for Alzheimer’s disease, and on this scale, a lower score indicates better cognitive performance. Before the trial began and after it concluded at 24 weeks, blood samples were collected from the participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team used these samples to measure the plasma concentrations of two specific amyloid-beta peptides: amyloid-beta 1–40 and amyloid-beta 1–42. The analysis focused on whether the levels of these proteins changed after treatment and if these changes related to cognitive outcomes. The study combined the data from the two higher dose groups, 750 and 1000 milligrams per day, as these were the dosages that showed cognitive benefits in the original trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed that sodium benzoate had a noticeable effect on amyloid-beta levels. When combining the data from the two effective dose groups, the treatment led to a significant reduction in the levels of amyloid-beta 1–40 in the blood compared to the placebo group. A similar significant reduction was seen in the total amount of amyloid-beta, which is the sum of both the 1–40 and 1–42 peptides. While there was a trend toward lower amyloid-beta 1–42 levels in the treatment group, this change was not statistically significant on its own. The 500-milligram dose did not produce significant changes in amyloid levels when analyzed separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also uncovered a predictive relationship between initial amyloid-beta levels and the treatment’s cognitive benefits. Among patients receiving the effective doses of 750 or 1000 milligrams of sodium benzoate, those who started the trial with higher levels of amyloid-beta 1–42 in their blood showed greater cognitive improvement over the 24 weeks. This improvement was measured as a larger decrease in their cognitive assessment scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This connection between higher baseline amyloid-beta 1–42 and better cognitive outcomes was not observed in the group that received the placebo, suggesting the effect was specific to the sodium benzoate treatment. The study also looked at other biological markers related to antioxidants but found no correlation between them and the changes in amyloid-beta levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers identified some limitations to their work that suggest areas for future inquiry. The sample size was moderate, which might mean that some real but smaller effects were too subtle to be detected with statistical confidence. The 24-week duration of the trial is also relatively short, so it is unknown if the cognitive and biological benefits would persist or grow over a longer period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the participants were of Han Taiwanese descent, and more studies would be needed to confirm if the results apply to people of other ethnic backgrounds. Future research could also explore if different dosages, perhaps even higher ones, might produce different or stronger effects. A significant question that remains is how changes in amyloid-beta levels in the blood relate to the amount of these proteins in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid, where they are thought to cause the most damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies could incorporate brain imaging techniques to directly observe the treatment’s impact on the brain, providing a more complete picture of its mechanism. Despite these limitations, the findings suggest that sodium benzoate, an oral medication with an excellent safety record, has the potential to become a new therapy for Alzheimer’s disease that works by reducing amyloid-beta proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-025-03492-3" target="_blank"&gt;Sodium benzoate treatment decreased amyloid beta peptides and improved cognitive function among patients with Alzheimer’s disease: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Chieh-Hsin Lin and Hsien-Yuan Lane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 11:12:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxNMHRsT2tRNk9Db0QtbTFpbko4RFMycV9uWkdQZHJDUEhNbnFvQzg2YW9pR3pDbzV0Vlh5ZmFwY2Z2bVBhWmlYTl9KbGc2SEU1cnRYX0dLaEhEU3BGU0k0dV9GTldLZW9VSklUY0ozc0N6WEg5bndvQzVwQmVTR0JsV080U1huQm1HZmxodThaU1JHVTNJSnJQams5LWtIdy0tUDRzY3EyYzRtdFZpZUdLak1JQW5TTEFtR0pucTBB</guid></item><item><title>根据专家的说法，这些“健康”食品对您的长寿没有任何好处- HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/healthy-foods-that-dont-help-you-live-longer_l_68bae665e4b09c6f4cf70e63</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While no one can control how long they’ll live completely, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-best-foods-to-eat-for-a-long-life-according-to-longevity-experts-goog_l_67c09237e4b09bdae0098ca0" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="what you eat " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68bae665e4b09c6f4cf70e63" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="67c09237e4b09bdae0098ca0" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;what you eat &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;plays a pretty significant role.

Instant oatmeal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s hard to think of a breakfast that sounds healthier than oatmeal. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Oats are great because they’re high in fiber and have lots of B vitamins,” Kupreeva said. According to a 2022 study published in &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;xcust=68bae665e4b09c6f4cf70e63&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs43016-023-00868-w" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Nutrients" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68bae665e4b09c6f4cf70e63" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;xcust=68bae665e4b09c6f4cf70e63&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs43016-023-00868-w" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, eating oats regularly helps lower inflammation — definitely a win on the longevity front. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For a lot of people, mornings are chaotic, which leads to relying on instant oatmeal, which can be microwaved in 60 seconds and comes pre-flavored, whether you’re in the mood for banana nut, maple sugar or peaches and cream. Unfortunately, Kupreeva told HuffPost that instant oatmeal is often high in added sugar. And &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11287388/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="added sugar is a life shortener" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68bae665e4b09c6f4cf70e63" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11287388/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;added sugar is a life shortener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, not a life lengthener. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are a few reasons why consuming too much sugar can take years off your life. Gidwani explained that sugary foods (like flavored instant oatmeal) spike blood sugar levels. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6205735/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Scientific studies show" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68bae665e4b09c6f4cf70e63" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6205735/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;Scientific studies show&lt;/a&gt; that when blood sugar levels are unstable and fluctuate regularly, it decreases lifespan. This is because unstable blood sugars increase the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease — all of which can shorten lifespan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To keep your oatmeal as healthy as possible, go for rolled oats and sweeten it with berries, a naturally sweet fruit that has been &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38184200/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="scientifically shown to support longevity" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68bae665e4b09c6f4cf70e63" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38184200/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;&lt;span&gt;scientifically shown to support longevity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Fruit juice &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It has fruit in the name, so it must be healthy, right? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://supp.co/u/darshan-shah" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Darshan Shah" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68bae665e4b09c6f4cf70e63" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://supp.co/u/darshan-shah" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Darshan Shah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a board-certified surgeon, founder of national longevity clinic &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.next-health.com/team/dr-darshan-shah" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Next Health" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68bae665e4b09c6f4cf70e63" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.next-health.com/team/dr-darshan-shah" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="13"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and expert advisor at SuppCo, shared that fruit juice doesn’t deserve its health halo. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Fruit juice is high in sugar and low in fiber,” he said. Kupreeva said this too, explaining that fruit juices don’t have the fiber and other nutrients whole fruit do. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Instead of drinking fruit juice, Kupreeva recommends eating whole fruit or sipping a smoothie, which still has all of the fiber and nutrients without any of the added sugar fruit juices often have.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Acai bowls &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Colorful fruit-topped acai bowls sure look healthy, but according to Gidwani, they are often full of added sugar and artificial ingredients. She explained that there’s a major nutritional difference between acai bowls made with berries and honey versus ones that are made with fruit juice which, as previously mentioned, are often high in added sugar. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Yuliya Furman / 500px via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Yuliya Furman / 500px via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Colorful fruit-topped acai bowls sure look healthy, but they are often full of added sugar and artificial ingredients.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re buying your acai bowl in the freezer section at the grocery store, Gidwani recommends reading the ingredients list and nutritional panel to check for added sugar. It will contain total sugar because of the fruit, which is fine, but if it’s high in added sugar, she recommends skipping it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Protein powders and bars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;No nutrient gets more attention than protein and while it’s important, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/eating-enough-protein_l_6895f260e4b001d68aee01fd" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="most people are getting enough" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68bae665e4b09c6f4cf70e63" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="6895f260e4b001d68aee01fd" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;&lt;span&gt;most people are getting enough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Not only do you likely not need protein powders and bars, but the experts we talked to said that most of them do nothing in terms of longevity. “Protein powders, while convenient, don’t provide the same benefits as whole-food protein sources,” Shah said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gidwani added to this, saying that protein bars can be helpful if you’re on-the-go and don’t have access to whole food ingredients. But she said that many are made with added sugar and other additives that aren’t good for health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gidwani pointed out that the benefit of consuming protein-rich foods like eggs, edamame, chickpeas or tofu is that these foods have other nutrients in addition to protein. But all a protein powder is going to bring to the table is that one singular nutrient. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Egg whites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When you’re at brunch and you hear someone order an egg white omelette, it can sound healthier than the scrambled eggs you’re considering. Don’t be fooled: It isn’t. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Egg whites are overrated. While egg whites do have protein, there are a lot of nutrients in the egg yolk, too,” Gidwani said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Certain lifestyle habits, like eating a nutritious diet, can lower dementia risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Walnuts are rich in healthy fats, antioxidants and fiber, which may protect both your brain and heart.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For a healthy brain, follow the MIND diet, stay physically active, sleep well and challenge your mind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Every three seconds, someone in the world is diagnosed with dementia, a condition marked by general decline in cognitive functioning.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Cognitive decline refers to a gradual loss of brain functions such as memory, attention, language, problem-solving and decision making. It ranges from mild changes that are a part of normal aging (like occasionally forgetting a name) to more serious impairments seen in conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease or other dementias,” states &lt;a href="https://www.nymc.edu/som/faculty/etienne-mill.php" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mill Etienne, M.D., M.P.H., FAAN, FAES&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of neurology and medicine at New York Medical College.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
While some risk factors for dementia are outside our control, research shows that a healthy lifestyle and nutrient-rich diet can help lower risk and preserve cognitive function with age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Among brain-boosting foods, nuts stand out for their protective benefits.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;But which nut offers the most support? According to neurologists, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-snack-for-better-memory-11803850" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;walnuts take the lead&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s what the science says about their potential role in reducing dementia risk, along with other expert-backed strategies.

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Contain Healthy Fats  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; All nuts contain healthy fats, but walnuts stand out as the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-for-brain-health-as-you-age-11739345" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;richest source of omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;. “Walnuts are a good source of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a plant-based omega-3 fatty acid,” notes &lt;a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/graff-radford-jonathan-m-d/bio-20157263" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Jonathan Graff-Radford, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., a behavioral neurologist and researcher at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. He adds, “Epidemiological studies have shown that nuts, including walnuts, are associated with a lower risk of dementia, particularly when eaten as part of the Mediterranean diet.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A 1-ounce (28-gram) serving of walnuts provides 2.5 grams of ALA—well above the adequate intake of 1.1 grams for adult females and 1.6 grams for adult males.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Diets high in omega-3s have been linked with a reduced risk of cognitive decline and dementia, including &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/everyday-habits-hurting-your-memory-11804198" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;benefits for memory&lt;/a&gt;, improved learning and overall cognitive well-being. This effect appears strongest when individuals consume all three types of omega-3s: ALA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The main role of ALA is to be converted into EPA and DHA—the two omega-3s most strongly tied to brain health—though this conversion is limited. Even so, research suggests that ALA may support brain health independently.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;One study found that higher intake of ALA was associated with slower cognitive decline and memory loss. Scientists believe that omega-3s may help by reducing inflammation and protecting neurons from premature death, though more research is needed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They’re Rich in Antioxidants &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “[Walnuts are] &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/surprising-antioxidant-rich-foods-you-should-eat-11776388" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich in antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;, which reduce oxidative stress and inflammation,” says Etienne. Walnuts contain omega-3s, phenolic acids, vitamin E, selenium, flavonoids and proanthocyanidins—all of which act as antioxidants in the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These antioxidants are critical for keeping your brain healthy as you age. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The oxidative stress theory of aging suggests that oxidative damage can lead to the loss of physiological and biochemical functions. Antioxidants help counteract his stress, potentially lowering the risk of neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Graff-Radford adds, “These compounds act as scavengers that neutralize free radicals, preventing them from causing damage.” While antioxidants are found in many plant foods, walnuts are an especially rich source—one key reason why they may protect your brain. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Support Heart Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your cardiovascular and brain health are closely connected—when your heart is healthy, your brain benefits. “Vascular cognitive impairment is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease,” explains Graff-Radford. “Walnuts can improve vascular health through several mechanisms, including improved lipid profiles.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People with heart disease face an increased risk of dementia as they age. Healthy lifestyle changes—such as not smoking, staying physically active and eating a balanced diet—can help lower that risk, even for those with a history of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fortunately, eating walnuts is linked with a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-habits-for-heart-health-11796620" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthier heart&lt;/a&gt;. One study in 636 participants found that those who ate 1 to 2 ounces (30 to 60 grams) of walnuts daily for two years had significantly lower total and LDL (“bad”) cholesterol. The researchers attributed these benefits to an increased intake of heart-healthy fats and fiber, both of which help support cardiovascular function.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to keeping your brain healthy as you age, your overall lifestyle also plays a key role. Here are some extra science-backed, neurologist-approved tips:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow the MIND diet.&lt;/strong&gt; The MIND diet was specifically designed to reduce the risk of cognitive decline. It emphasizes antioxidant-rich foods while limiting those high in saturated fat. “Key food groups include green leafy vegetables, berries, beans, whole grains, seafoods high in omega-3 fatty acids, and olive oil,” notes Graff-Radford.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Active.&lt;/strong&gt; “Regular physical activity is extremely important,” adds Etienne. “Aerobic exercise boosts blood flow to the brain and stimulates neuroplasticity.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity every week, or at least 20 minutes per day, as well as two days of strength training.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink Green Tea&lt;/strong&gt;. Regular green tea consumption is linked with better health outcomes, including a reduced risk of cognitive decline. “[It] contains L-theanine and polyphenols that may enhance focus and protect neurons,” says Etienne.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get a Good Night’s Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;. Your brain recharges while you sleep. Graff-Radford notes, “Quality sleep allows your brain to process memories and clear out waste.” Start or maintain a healthy bedtime ritual to help you get enough sleep.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep Learning.&lt;/strong&gt; That daily Wordle habit or crossword puzzle may be more important than you realize. Graff-Radford says, “Challenge your mind with puzzles, reading or new hobbies to maintain strong thinking skills.” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Your Hearing&lt;/strong&gt;. “One factor that is underrecognized is that if you have hearing loss, it is important to get a properly fitted and functioning hearing aid if that is indicated,” states Etienne. Hearing loss is a risk factor for dementia, and treating it helps lower that risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage Other Health Conditions.&lt;/strong&gt; “Control conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes, and avoid smoking, as they impact brain health,” notes Graff-Radford. Talk to your health care team if you are having trouble managing your blood sugar or blood pressure. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not only do walnuts look like little brains, but they may help protect our brains as we age. They support cognitive health because they’re rich in healthy fats and antioxidants and help keep our hearts healthy. In addition to eating more walnuts, eating a plant-rich diet, staying physically active and getting enough sleep can further support brain health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “While occasional forgetfulness is normal as you age, cognitive decline involves more significant changes in your ability to remember things, solve problems or use language,” notes Graff-Radford. “If you or someone you know is experiencing noticeable changes in memory or thinking, it's important to talk to a health care professional. They can help figure out what’s going on and if any treatment or support is needed.”

While in its early stages, the disease is often confined to the gland itself, advanced prostate cancer may spread to distant parts of the body such as the bones, lymph nodes, and, in rarer cases, the skin. When cancer cells reach the skin, this is known as cutaneous metastasis. These skin changes can sometimes resemble ordinary dermatological conditions, making them difficult to recognise. Identifying such symptoms early is vital, as it supports timely diagnosis, guides effective management, highlights disease progression, and aids in monitoring treatment response and overall patient prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding cutaneous metastasis in prostate cancer: Spread of cancer cells to the skin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutaneous metastasis refers to the spread of cancer cells to the skin from a primary tumour located elsewhere in the body. In prostate cancer, this occurrence is uncommon but significant. A study published in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/ijd/fulltext/2024/03000/beyond_the_usual_suspects__when_the_skin_tells_a.17.aspx" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt; Indian Journal of Dermatology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; indicates that skin metastases from prostate cancer are rare, with an incidence of approximately 0.36%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Prostate Cancer Guide: Expert Reveals Causes and Prevention Strategies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These skin lesions often appear in the later stages of prostate cancer and can serve as an indicator of advanced disease. The presence of skin metastases is associated with a poor prognosis, with average survival times of less than six months following the appearance of these lesions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Common skin symptoms associated with prostate cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;1. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Nodules and papules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most frequent skin manifestations of prostate cancer metastasis are hard nodules or papules. These lesions are typically firm to the touch, raised above the skin’s surface, and may vary in size from a few millimetres to several centimetres. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are usually skin-coloured to reddish-brown and can sometimes mimic benign skin growths such as cysts or lipomas, which makes diagnosis challenging. Nodules most often appear on the chest, abdomen, and extremities, though they can occasionally develop near the genital area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;2. Zosteriform distribution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In rare cases, cutaneous metastases may present in what is called a zosteriform distribution. This refers to skin lesions that appear in a band-like arrangement along a dermatome – the area of skin supplied by sensory nerves from a single spinal root. These lesions may be misdiagnosed as shingles (herpes zoster) due to their similar appearance and distribution. Unlike shingles, however, zosteriform metastases are usually not painful or associated with blistering. They may appear as clustered papules or plaques and can progress over time, becoming firmer and more extensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;3. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sclerodermoid lesions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another uncommon but significant skin manifestation of prostate cancer metastasis is sclerodermoid lesions. These present as hard, thickened, and sometimes shiny patches of skin that closely resemble scleroderma, an autoimmune condition that causes fibrosis and tightening of the skin. According to a study published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ijdvl.com/cutaneous-metastasis-of-an-advanced-prostate-cancer/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venerology, and Leprology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, the affected skin may feel bound down to the underlying tissue, limiting mobility and flexibility in the area. Such lesions are often mistaken for dermatological conditions such as morphea or lichen sclerosus, delaying the correct diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;4. Ulcerated lesions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although less common, ulcerated lesions may develop as a result of cutaneous prostate cancer metastases. These lesions occur when the cancerous nodules break through the skin’s surface, leaving open, raw sores that may ooze fluid or bleed. Ulcerated lesions are typically painful and difficult to manage, as they are prone to bacterial infections and have a slow-healing process. Their appearance usually signifies advanced or terminal disease, and they can severely impact a patient’s comfort and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Diagnosis and differentiation from other skin conditions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5903053/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt; PMC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; shows that diagnosing cutaneous metastasis from prostate cancer requires a thorough clinical evaluation and histopathological examination.

Kennedy Jr. is attacking the hepatitis B vaccine, look to the rhetoric coming from his loudest fans in the anti-vaccine movement. According to the misnamed Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement, the only women who get hepatitis B are filthy degenerates. Jillian Michaels, the former reality TV star-turned right-wing demagogue, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jE5yx6LoiY"&gt;declared last year&lt;/a&gt; that the hepatitis B vaccine is only useful for “drug addicts and people who have risky sex.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are we protecting them for a lifetime of unprotected sex and drugs?” a popular MAHA advocate &lt;a href="https://x.com/VigilantFox/status/1968655869312147583"&gt;complained on X&lt;/a&gt;, apparently thinking it’s self-evident that that such protection is unnecessary for good people. A favorite anti-vaccine podcaster &lt;a href="https://x.com/RealDrJaneRuby/status/1968686756309385548"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that hepatitis B is a disease of people who have “anal sex” and who get “stuck with a needle full of blood of an infected person.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across X, so-called “MAHA moms” have &lt;a href="https://x.com/JenniferMarguli/status/1353081670442774528"&gt;made it clear&lt;/a&gt; that they feel insulted by &lt;a href="https://x.com/millerkim34/status/1968352363040927843"&gt;the pre-Kennedy recommendation that newborns&lt;/a&gt; get vaccinated for hepatitis B, as if the doctor is implying that, as mothers, they are among the “bad” women who do drugs or have what they consider the wrong kind of sex. This is why &lt;span&gt;Susan Monarez, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/watch-susan-monarez-fired-cdc-chief-senate-hearing-rfk-jr-vaccines-hepatitis-b/"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; during her Senate testimony last week that Kennedy was ignoring scientific evidence to attack vaccine access, including a hepatitis B vaccine administered to newborns. On Friday, under fire from medical experts and several Republicans, Kennedy’s hand-picked CDC vaccine panel &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/rfk-jrs-vaccine-panel-postpones-vote-on-hepatitis-b-shot-for-babies.html"&gt;postponed a vote&lt;/a&gt; on whether to delay the newborn immunizations. But with the secretary’s army of MAHA moms insisting the vaccine is an attack on their purity, the threat of a policy change is not over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="youtube-classic-embed"&gt;&lt;span class="w-full flex justify-center !m-0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moral dictates, of course, don’t protect infants from hepatitis B. As pediatrician Dr. Paul Offit &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/opinion/cdc-vaccine-panel-rfk.html"&gt;told the New York Times&lt;/a&gt; last week, unvaccinated babies can get the virus — even if their mothers aren’t infected — “from relatively casual contact with people who had chronic hepatitis B.” Unlike adults, “you’re especially vulnerable as an infant,” he said. But don’t expect MAHA moms to accept that reality. Their draconian rules for what makes a “good” mother are such that they’d still blame women if babies got infected, because proper mothers heavily police their child’s contact with the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, Kennedy and the MAHA movement’s obsession with shaming women was on full display with the Washington Post’s &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/21/trump-autism-announcement-tylenol-leucovorin/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; that HHS is set to tie autism risk to women who use Tylenol during pregnancy. As with most claims coming from Kennedy’s disinformation-happy machine, this finding is &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/research-doesnt-show-using-tylenol-during-pregnancy-causes-autism-here-are-5-things-to-know"&gt;false&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s easy to see how the idea fits neatly into the right’s sexist vision of motherhood as a state of endless self-sacrifice. Tylenol is already discouraged for treating minor aches and pains during pregnancy. The medical consensus is that it should only be used to battle high fevers that can be dangerous for both the mother and the developing fetus. But the vision of a woman enduring misery to “protect” her baby is romanticized by the right — even if the suffering would, in this case, only risk the health of the baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/09/nx-s1-5534412/rfk-maha-report-childrens-health"&gt;newly released report&lt;/a&gt; from the so-called MAHA Commission also underscores how Kennedy and his allies are hyper-focused on shaming women, even if it comes at the expense of harming children. Even though it was advertised as the “&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/maha-commission-report-childhood-disease-strategy.html"&gt;Make Our Children Healthy Again Strategy&lt;/a&gt;,” the report includes almost no substantive proposals for government action to improve child health. Instead, it shifts even more responsibility for child health outcomes onto the parents. Most of the strategy is about “educating” parents about what Kennedy believes is proper child-rearing, including his esoteric and false ideas about nutrition. (The secretary, for instance, thinks eating a diet high in animal fat is good, contrary to the wide consensus of medical experts.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even on the issue of environmental pollution, which Kennedy claims to care about, the onus is on parents, not on government regulators. The report recommends that HHS “inform the public, especially parents and caregivers, about how environmental factors can affect children’s health outcomes.” In other words, if you live in a high-pollution area, it’s on you to move. If you can’t afford it, it’s your fault for being poor. The polluting companies, and the government that is supposed to regulate them, are blameless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the biggest government initiative proposed in the document is deregulating food safety standards, which would make it easier for shady operations to sell goods at farmers markets. A lot of MAHA types argue that food regulation should be left to individual consumers to investigate every purchase individually and determine if it feels safe to them. Casey Means, a “wellness” influencer President Donald Trump nominated to be surgeon general on Kennedy’s recommendation, has rejected pasteurization requirements. Instead, she has &lt;a href="https://www.caseymeans.com/learn/newsletter-38"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that women should “form a relationship with a local farmer, understand his integrity, look him in the eyes, pet his cow, and then decide” if the milk is safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, this recommendation is profoundly stupid. One cannot tell if a cow’s milk is safe by petting the animal. But what Means recommends would require a time commitment that is not feasible for most people, especially busy mothers. With the deregulation of food safety being pushed by the Trump administration, the process of “researching” your own food would reach far beyond just milk. Even if driving to the farm and buying everything directly were a way to verify food safety — and it’s not — it’s ridiculous to expect modern people to forgo the basic convenience of the grocery store. This would also mean having to cook way more from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommendations like these may not seem overtly sexist. But with the larger MAGA movement pushing traditional gender roles, there can be little doubt that women will be the ones expected to handle the new influx of responsibilities pushed on them by the MAHA culture. It’s women who would be expected to give up pouring a child a bowl of cereal in favor of making bread from scratch. It’s women who would be tasked with staying home with kids who have measles. And if those children were to die, women would be blamed for supposedly not feeding them enough homegrown organic foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movement’s &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/paleofuture.bsky.social/post/3lygp3go3js2s"&gt;preoccupation with shaming women&lt;/a&gt; is evident in the fertility section of the MAHA strategy document. A call to “address the root causes of infertility” sounds innocuous enough. In reality, this phrase is MAHA code for shaming women who use birth control. As I &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/08/08/trumps-drops-ivf-promise-preferring-to-blame-women-for-infertility/"&gt;reported last month&lt;/a&gt;, various MAHA groups have become fixated on the lie that the birth control pill is the cause of infertility. Means has &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gcyxb7asLwI&amp;amp;t=3s"&gt;made the podcast rounds&lt;/a&gt;, blaming birth control for infertility. Alex Clark, who was hired by Charlie Kirk to be Turning Point USA’s “wellness” influencer, has also &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/birth-control-side-effects-influencers-danger-rcna90492"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that women suffering infertility brought it on themselves by previous birth control use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all a lie — but the strategy fits into the larger moralism that fuels the MAHA movement and is centered around this notion that modern life has made women “impure” and children’s health problems are a direct result. Having sex for pleasure is the main source of this alleged “impurity,” of course, and it’s why both birth control and abortion are demonized. Vaccine opponents even &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-vaccines-do-not-contain-fetal-cells-thimerosal/?srsltid=AfmBOoqz40yGquo-vzjlemd0uHs3n_GMOQX644QoLkiNZVk_4aBz6HyT"&gt;falsely claim&lt;/a&gt; that vaccines contain the cells of aborted fetuses, an explicit reminder of their belief that children are being tainted by the wanton sexualities of modern women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, the New York Times &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/us/politics/vaccine-mandates-covid-measles.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on how the measles outbreak that killed at least two children in Texas is impacting vaccination opponents in the state. To the reporter’s apparent surprise, it turns out these people don’t appear to care if children die. They seem to view such tragedies as a price to pay to uphold a right-wing values system that is obsessed with ideas of purity and traditional gender roles. The anti-vaccine views are wrapped into larger sexist attitudes. They expect women to home school children. They create banks of breast milk from unvaccinated women and demand babysitters be unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that female bodies are made unclean by vaccines is all tied up in a larger sexist view that good women stay at home and avoid too much contact with the outside world. Republicans may have not liked the pandemic lockdowns, but when it comes to women, a version of that is being upheld as a permanent alternative to the fictional evils of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A team of researchers from Stanford University and the Arc Institute in Palo Alto, California say they’ve created viruses with AI-designed DNA that can target and &lt;/span&gt;kill specific bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And these aren’t just simulated possibilities — they’re real and already slaying germs in the lab.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The work, published in a &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.12.675911v1" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;new study awaiting peer-review&lt;/a&gt;, is a compelling testament to the usefulness of large language models in bioengineering applications, the authors say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This is the first time AI systems are able to write coherent genome-scale sequences,” senior author Brian Hie, a Stanford computational biologist, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03055-y" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03055-y" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “The next step is AI-generated life.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Coauthor Samuel King, however, cautioned that a “lot of experimental advances need to occur in order to design an entire living organism.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Viruses aren’t quite considered to be alive. Think of them like pesky little genomic robots that hijack our biology to replicate, since they don’t generate their own energy and can’t reproduce on their own. They aren’t made of cells, and are driven by a ruthless set of programmed instructions to multiply at all costs. Since their genomes are pretty simple, they’re easier to tinker with and less ambitious for a human or machine to recreate. Remember: a genome is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; the DNA in an organism, not just a few strands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the study, the researchers used an AI model called Evo to dream up the virus genomes. Unlike a general purpose large language model, Evo is specifically trained on millions of bacteriophage genomes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A bacteriophage is a virus that infects bacteria. To use as a jumping off point, the researchers chose a phage called phiX174 (or ΦX174), which infects strains of the wide family of bacteria known as &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. As the first DNA-based genome to be sequenced, phiX174 is an extensively studied and well understood virus, and only has around 5,400 base pairs and 11 genes, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;After probing the AI model, the team came up with 302 virus designs. The best way to test them, the researchers figured, was to print, or chemically assemble, all of them and unleash them on real strains of &lt;i&gt;E. Coli&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;As it turned out, some of them worked. Once inserted into the poor waiting germs, 16 of the AI-designed viruses successfully infected their hosts by inserting their DNA, hijacking the bacteria to start cranking out copies of themselves, and then burst through the cell’s body, killing it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Sixteen out of 302 isn’t the highest batting average, but it’s a remarkable achievement nonetheless. Overall, the researchers found that their bot-conceived creations could kill three different &lt;i&gt;E. Coli &lt;/i&gt;strains, outperforming natural phiX174.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“In many cases,” wrote Niko McCarty, a former bioengineer for Caltech and Imperial College London, &lt;a href="https://press.asimov.com/articles/ai-phages" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;for &lt;i&gt;Asimov Press&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “they were more infectious than wildtype phiX174 despite carrying major genome alterations that a human would be unlikely to rationally design.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;As promising as the results are, they also raise huge ethical concerns. If an AI model can come up with functioning phages, it could also be potentially abused to create bioweapons, experts warned, or even unintentionally create an out-of-control virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“One area where I urge extreme caution is any viral enhancement research, especially when it’s random so you don’t know what you are getting,” Craig Venter, founder of the J. Craig Venter Institute, who is known for his pioneering work in creating organisms with synthetic DNA, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/17/1123801/ai-virus-bacteriophage-life/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;told &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “If someone did this with smallpox or anthrax, I would have grave concerns.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And according to Venter, the AI usage isn’t all that radical — it’s “just a faster version of trial-and-error experiments.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But until now, AI models have only demonstrated that they could generate some DNA sequences like in proteins. And some of these new AI-written genomes are “so distinct from any known bacteriophage genome that they would technically be classified as their own species,” according to McCarty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In all, this is the first time the tech has produced entire genomes that actually work in the real world. And that’s pretty significant, good or bad.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It was quite a surprising result that was really exciting for us because it shows that this method might potentially be very useful for therapeutics,” King told &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In addition, four methylation classes in B-ALL were produced by subdivision of published categories (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig9"&gt;1d,e&lt;/a&gt;), while nine methylation classes (eight AML, one ALAL) have not been previously described to our knowledge (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig9"&gt;1c,f&lt;/a&gt;). Samples without prior class annotations or with incomplete genetic data were assigned a methylation class by label propagation (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig9"&gt;1g–j&lt;/a&gt;; see &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Sec10"&gt;Methods&lt;/a&gt;). Across methylation classes, we did not observe unexpected bias according to array version, tissue type or sex (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig1"&gt;1b&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig9"&gt;1b,k&lt;/a&gt;). T-ALL classes generally showed a more hypermethylated epigenome, while AML classes were more hypomethylated, in agreement with previous reports (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig1"&gt;1c&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 39" title="Hetzel, S. et al.

Overall, methylation-based classification showed high concordance with immunophenotypic evaluation, assigning an identical lineage in 2,189 out of 2,249 (97.3%) cases (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig1"&gt;1d&lt;/a&gt;). AML, B-ALL and T-ALL showed lineage concordance in 96.7%, 99.7% and 98.4% of cases, respectively, and we did not observe a difference in lineage concordance between adult and pediatric cases (98.0% and 97.1%, respectively; Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig10"&gt;2a&lt;/a&gt;). By contrast, MPAL were reclassified to a single lineage in ten out of 14 (71.4%) cases. Among lineage discordant cases, the majority (49 out of 60, 81.6%) localized to methylation classes characterized by molecular alterations with known lineage ambiguity, including BCL11B-activated ALAL (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 17), HOXA9-activated T-ALL (associated with &lt;i&gt;PICALM::MLLT10&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 23) and ZNF384-r and KMT2A-r B-ALL (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 4 and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 5, respectively; Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig1"&gt;1d&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig10"&gt;2b,c&lt;/a&gt;). In these cases, methylation classes mostly reflected the underlying molecular driver rather than the lineage defined by immunophenotype. Specifically, nearly all samples in our cohort with genetic alterations in &lt;i&gt;BCL11B&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PICALM::MLLT10&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ZNF384&lt;/i&gt;-r were assigned to the associated methylation class (eight out of eight BCL11B ALAL, 11 out of 11 &lt;i&gt;PICALM::MLLT10&lt;/i&gt; T-ALL and 23 out of 24 ZNF384-r B-ALL; Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig10"&gt;2d–f&lt;/a&gt;). Together, these findings support DNA methylation profiling as a valuable approach to assign acute leukemia lineages and identify patients with rare or cryptic alterations associated with lineage ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec4"&gt;DNA methylation resolves disease heterogeneity in AML&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We next examined disease heterogeneity within specific acute leukemia lineages in more detail. As noted above, we did not identify considerable additional heterogeneity in T-ALL and B-ALL in addition to that reported previously (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig9"&gt;1c&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 22" title="Nordlund, J. et al.

Consistent with this reasoning, eight out of 21 AML methylation classes were defined by specific genetic drivers, including seven classes (PML::RARA, RUNX1::RUNX1T1, CBFB::MYH11, FUS-r, ETV6::MNX1, HNRNPH1::ERG and GLIS-r) defined by specific gene fusions and one class defined by mutations in &lt;i&gt;CEBPA&lt;/i&gt; (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig2"&gt;2a&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig11"&gt;3a&lt;/a&gt;). These eight methylation classes captured nearly all cases in our retrospective cohort with the corresponding genetic alterations (407 out of 426, 95.5%) and showed expected patient age distributions, survival outcomes and differentiation patterns per French–American–British (FAB) categories (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig2"&gt;2b&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig11"&gt;3b–d&lt;/a&gt;). Among the few cases with these genetic alterations that localized outside their expected methylation class (one out of 155 &lt;i&gt;RUNX1::RUNX1T1&lt;/i&gt;, two out of 143 &lt;i&gt;CBFB::MYH11&lt;/i&gt;, 13 out of 64 &lt;i&gt;CEBPA&lt;/i&gt;-mut and three out of 19 &lt;i&gt;GLIS&lt;/i&gt;-r), competing genetic drivers were present in most cases. Specifically, all (13 out of 13) cases with &lt;i&gt;CEBPA&lt;/i&gt; mutations outside the CEBPA methylation class harbored co-occurring alterations in additional leukemia-associated genes (including &lt;i&gt;NPM1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 4), &lt;i&gt;IDH1/2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3), &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 1), genes associated with myelodysplasia-related changes (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 4), &lt;i&gt;NUP98&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 2) and &lt;i&gt;FLT3&lt;/i&gt; (n = 3); Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig12"&gt;4a,b&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#MOESM3"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;). Moreover, 11 out of 13 samples (84.6%) lacked canonical bZIP in-frame insertions and deletions (indels), and no sample had bi-allelic mutations (zero out of five samples with available information). Therefore, these cases would not be categorized as prognostically favorable &lt;i&gt;CEBPA-&lt;/i&gt;mutated AML by recent classification schemes&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2" title="Arber, D.

For example, we identified three methylation classes (IDH-enriched, chromatin/spliceosome-enriched and TP53/aneuploidy-enriched) associated with older age and myelodysplasia-related changes, which localized close to normal controls and encompassed multiple distinct but biologically related alterations. (Extended Data Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig11"&gt;3b,c&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig12"&gt;4e–h&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#MOESM3"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;). As another example, we identified nine AML methylation classes defined by expression of &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HOXB5&lt;/i&gt; (groups 1–4) or expression of &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; alone (groups 5–9; Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig2"&gt;2c&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig13"&gt;5a–c&lt;/a&gt;). HOXA/B-activated methylation classes were highly enriched for &lt;i&gt;NPM1&lt;/i&gt;-mut, while HOXA-activated classes were defined by &lt;i&gt;KMT2A&lt;/i&gt;-r, and each showed expected associations with monocytic differentiation (FAB M4/M5; Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig2"&gt;2d&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig11"&gt;3a&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 47" title="Umeda, M. et al.

However, &lt;i&gt;NPM1&lt;/i&gt;-mut and &lt;i&gt;KMT2A&lt;/i&gt;-r were found across several distinct HOX methylation classes, suggesting that epigenetic profiling can complement and refine disease heterogeneity revealed by orthogonal genetic and transcriptional studies. Of note, activating mutations in &lt;i&gt;FLT3&lt;/i&gt;, an indication for targeted therapy in AML, were also enriched in several HOXA/B-activated methylation classes but were not class-defining on their own (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig12"&gt;4b&lt;/a&gt;).

Of those samples, 60 were wild-type for &lt;i&gt;NPM1&lt;/i&gt; and had a karyotype that did not show evidence of HOX-activating translocations, while 12 had missing information (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig3"&gt;3b&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#MOESM3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;).

Interestingly, we found that methylation classes were not defined by specific &lt;i&gt;KMT2A&lt;/i&gt; fusion partners (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig3"&gt;3d&lt;/a&gt;). To better understand the similarities and differences between groups 5–9, we jointly analyzed available genetic, transcriptional and clinical data. We focused on the TARGET AML0531 and AML1031 trials, the two most homogenous AML datasets of adequate size available for analysis. Transcription data revealed class-specific expression patterns of &lt;i&gt;MECOM&lt;/i&gt; in group 5, &lt;i&gt;HMX3&lt;/i&gt; in groups 6–8 and &lt;i&gt;FOXC1&lt;/i&gt; in group 9 (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig13"&gt;5d–f&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#MOESM3"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" title="Elsherif, M. et al.

Groups 5–7 represented patients of all age groups, while patients in groups 8 and 9 were almost exclusively below the age of 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retrospective analysis of survival data showed differential outcomes between HOX groups 5–9 in the AML0531 and AML1031 cohorts (log-rank test, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 1.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;, C-index, 0.612; Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig3"&gt;3e&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig13"&gt;5g&lt;/a&gt;). Group 6 (KAT6A-r) and group 5 (MECOM-activated KMT2A-r) showed the poorest survival (median overall survival of 0.51 years and 2.01 years, respectively), while group 9 (FOXC1-activated KMT2A-r) displayed more favorable outcomes (median overall survival not reached). Finally, we asked whether stratification by methylation class could explain outcome heterogeneity for specific &lt;i&gt;KMT2A&lt;/i&gt; fusion partners. We specifically investigated &lt;i&gt;KMT2A::MLLT3&lt;/i&gt;, the most common &lt;i&gt;KMT2A&lt;/i&gt; rearrangement in AML, which shows intermediate survival among pediatric patients (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig13"&gt;5h&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 60" title="Meyer, C. et al.

When further stratified by methylation class, our analysis suggests that patients in group 5 (MECOM-activated KMT2A-r) are associated with worse survival than patients in HOXA-activated groups 7 and 8 (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03 and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.1, respectively; Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig3"&gt;3f&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, our results indicate that epigenetic classification, in concert with standard-of-care genetic approaches, could help identify patients with HOX-activated acute leukemia, including those driven by rare or unknown genetic alterations. In some cases, HOX-associated methylation classes may provide an additional layer of information that refines risk stratification based solely on genetics. However, implications for clinical outcomes and treatment, including how to best integrate methylation-based classification with standard-of-care approaches, must be studied in larger cohorts and is an important direction for future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec6"&gt;A neural network for epigenetic acute leukemia classification&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on our reference cohort, we next aimed to create a machine learning model to predict methylation classes for query cases profiled using different epigenomic profiling technologies, including low-coverage whole-genome nanopore sequencing.

These studies motivated our approach to develop MARLIN, a neural network-based classifier for acute leukemia (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig4"&gt;4a&lt;/a&gt;). Network architecture includes all 357,340 high-quality methylation array probes as an input layer, two fully connected hidden layers and an output layer providing confidence scores for each of the 38 acute leukemia methylation classes and four control classes (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig4"&gt;4b&lt;/a&gt;). To enable accurate predictions from shallow sequencing, several adaptations were made during model development, including random removal of 99% of input cytosine–phosphate–guanine (CpG) sites during each training epoch (see &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Sec10"&gt;Methods&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-4" data-title="Development of the MARLIN classifier."&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b id="Fig4" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text"&gt;Fig. 4: Development of the MARLIN classifier.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__figure-content"&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-4-desc"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;, Schematic of MARLIN training and performance estimation.

Reference methylation array beta values are binarized, 50 samples for each class are randomly selected and 10% artificial noise is added to the data. Fivefold cross-validation is performed to estimate model performance at different levels of sparsity in the test sets. &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;, Schematic depicting MARLIN neural network architecture. The network is composed of an input layer equal to the number of probes in the reference (357,340), two hidden layers with 256 and 128 nodes and a final layer for the multiclass classification represented by 42 nodes. A 99% dropout is applied to the input layer only during training at each epoch (left). MARLIN generates scores corresponding to methylation class probabilities. Scores sum up to 1 across classes (right). Methylation class colors are the same as in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig1"&gt;1a&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate our model, we performed fivefold cross-validation analysis of the training dataset (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig5"&gt;5a&lt;/a&gt;). Using all CpGs, MARLIN showed high precision in distinguishing acute leukemia lineages (2,324 out of 2,356 cases, median F1 score of 0.99 across lineages) and methylation classes (2,175 out of 2,356 cases, median F1 score of 0.91, range of 0.63–1.00; Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig14"&gt;6a,b&lt;/a&gt;). Of 181 misclassified cases, 31 (17.1%) had high prediction scores for control classes, suggesting low tumor-cell content. Misclassifications otherwise occurred between closely related methylation classes, such as HOXA-activated (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 26, 14.3%) and HOXA/B-activated AML (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 18, 9.9%). Therefore, we grouped closely related classes into methylation class families, reasoning that this would allow us to increase the predictive confidence for biologically similar classes (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#MOESM3"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Sec10"&gt;Methods&lt;/a&gt;).

In fivefold cross-validation, we found that classification performance remained high for methylation class, family and lineage (median F1 scores of 0.91, 0.95 and 0.99, respectively) at simulated sparsity levels up to 97% (corresponding to 10,720 CpGs; Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig14"&gt;6d–f&lt;/a&gt;). We found that a classification threshold of 0.8 offered a viable compromise between sensitivity and specificity across different levels of sparsity (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig14"&gt;6g&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We further validated the ability of MARLIN to use data from different DNA methylation profiling technologies with varying levels of sparsity.

In two cases of fusion-defined AML (AL_010 and AL_024), additional high-coverage nanopore sequencing with the PromethION platform confirmed underlying &lt;i&gt;RUNX1::RUNX1T1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PML::RARA&lt;/i&gt; fusions, consistent with clinical cytogenetic testing and the predicted methylation classes (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig6"&gt;6c,d&lt;/a&gt;). In one case (AL_014) harboring three non-canonical &lt;i&gt;CEBPA&lt;/i&gt; mutations (that is, not bZIP in-frame indels) and co-mutations in &lt;i&gt;NPM1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;DNMT3A&lt;/i&gt;, MARLIN assigned a HOXA/B-activated group 4 rather than CEBPA methylation class, in agreement with prior observations in our reference cohort (Extended Data Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig12"&gt;4a&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig15"&gt;7c&lt;/a&gt;). MARLIN also resulted in refined classifications in cases of AML with mutated &lt;i&gt;NPM1&lt;/i&gt;, which were classified as HOXA/B-activated methylation classes in a manner consistent with their observed co-mutation patterns, including HOXA/B-activated group 2 (AL_008, co-mutation in &lt;i&gt;TET2&lt;/i&gt;) and HOXA/B-activated group 3 (AL_017 and AL_018, co-mutations in &lt;i&gt;IDH2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;IDH1&lt;/i&gt;, respectively; Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig6"&gt;6b&lt;/a&gt;). In one case of B-ALL not otherwise specified (AL_002), MARLIN refined the molecular classification and led to the discovery of a cryptic genetic driver with prognostic importance. Classification showed a high score (1.00) for the B-ALL &lt;i&gt;DUX4&lt;/i&gt;-r methylation class. We confirmed the cryptic &lt;i&gt;DUX4&lt;/i&gt; translocation with high-coverage nanopore sequencing (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig6"&gt;6e&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one case (AL_005), methylation-based classification (0.96 for AML IDH-enriched) was discordant with the clinical diagnosis of Ph+ (p190) B-ALL. This sample was from a 68-year-old male who experienced a sustained remission following tyrosine kinase inhibitor and blinatumomab therapies and subsequent bone marrow transplantation. Further investigation did not identify hotspot mutations in &lt;i&gt;IDH1&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;IDH2&lt;/i&gt; that would explain the lineage discordance, although examination of copy-number profiles revealed losses of chromosomes 7q and 16q, which can be seen in myeloid-lineage neoplasms, and flow cytometry reported aberrant co-expression of myeloid antigens CD13 and CD33 on B-ALL cells (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig15"&gt;7a,d&lt;/a&gt;). Finally, in three out of 19 cases, MARLIN yielded a confidence score less than 0.8; however, all of these cases still showed dominant predictions at the level of methylation class (AL_011, 0.74 for AML HOXA-activated group 5; AL_001, 0.69 for B-ALL Ph/Ph-like) or methylation class family (AL_007, 0.84 for B-ALL Ph/PAX5) that were concordant with the pathology diagnosis (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig6"&gt;6b&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To extend our validation, we analyzed 15 additional retrospective cases, including ten AML, four B-ALL and one MPAL (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig16"&gt;8a–c&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#MOESM3"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;). These samples were profiled using multiplexed sequencing on the PromethION platform. Of cases that received a high-confidence MARLIN prediction (≥0.8), ten out of ten (100%) were concordant with results from conventional pathology evaluation, including three cases that received a more refined molecular classification (AL_028, B-ALL PAX5 group B; AL_033, AML IDH-enriched; and AL_027, AML TP53/aneuploidy-enriched). Among cases that did not receive a high-confidence prediction, three out of five had dominant classes that were in agreement with pathology results (AL_029, AL_036 and AL_039). The two remaining cases received dominant class predictions of bone marrow controls (AL_030) and mixed T cells and lineage-concordant acute leukemia classes (AL_034), possibly because of low tumor purity (blast counts 10% and 22%, respectively). None of the cases profiled in this validation set received a discordant prediction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we also tested MARLIN on samples from healthy donors and patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a precursor state to AML that was not included in our reference cohort. Of ten samples profiled from healthy donors (four bone marrow, six whole blood), all were predicted as control methylation classes (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig16"&gt;8d&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#MOESM3"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;). Among six MDS cases, two received high scores for the AML TP53/aneuploidy-enriched methylation class, while two were predicted as control classes and two received low scores for other myelodysplasia-related methylation classes (AML IDH-enriched, AML Chromatin/spliceosome-enriched; Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig16"&gt;8e&lt;/a&gt;, Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#MOESM3"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;). These results suggest shared epigenetic features between MDS and MDS-associated AML and highlight the limitations of applying MARLIN to cases that have not met criteria for acute leukemia by standard-of-care methods. In summary, our findings indicate that MARLIN, coupled with nanopore sequencing of clinical samples, can correctly classify acute leukemia subtypes, achieving concordant diagnoses in 25 out of 26 (96.2%) cases that achieved high-confidence prediction scores across our two validation cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec8"&gt;MARLIN for real-time acute leukemia classification&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having established our framework for retrospective samples, we evaluated whether classifications could be obtained in a rapid manner through real-time analysis of nanopore sequencing data&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" title="Euskirchen, P. et al.

As a proof of concept, we used MARLIN to simulate real-time methylation class predictions with sequencing data from our initial retrospective nanopore cohort. Comparing simulated real-time predictions to results obtained with the full dataset, we found that 14 out of 16 confidently predicted cases reached an identical classification (prediction score of ≥0.8) in less than 1 h of sequencing (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig17"&gt;9a,b&lt;/a&gt;). We next implemented MARLIN locally as an automated workflow on a GridION sequencer to generate methylation class predictions in real-time (see &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Sec10"&gt;Methods&lt;/a&gt;). To test our workflow, we re-sequenced sample AL_016 and obtained a concordant classification after just 50 min of sequencing (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig17"&gt;9c&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We next applied MARLIN for real-time, prospective analysis of research-consented samples from five patients presenting with suspected acute leukemia at our institution (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#MOESM3"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;). The first case (RTC_001) was a 61-year-old female with leukocytosis (63 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and 50% peripheral blasts (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig7"&gt;7a&lt;/a&gt;). After 56 min of sample processing and 40 min of nanopore sequencing, we obtained a high-confidence (≥0.8) MARLIN prediction for the AML TP53/aneuploidy-enriched class (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig7"&gt;7b&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#MOESM3"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;). In parallel, conventional diagnostic assays were performed that arrived at a diagnosis of AML with mutated &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt; after 4 days, in agreement with the MARLIN classification (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig7"&gt;7c–e&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig17"&gt;9d–f&lt;/a&gt;).

After 55 min of sample preparation and 40 min of sequencing, MARLIN generated a high-confidence prediction for the AML HOXA/B-activated group 2 (NPM1/TET2-enriched) methylation class (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig8"&gt;8b&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#MOESM3"&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;). Results of conventional diagnostic testing after 3 days showed AML with monocytic differentiation (M5), blasts with cup-shaped nuclei and &lt;i&gt;NPM1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TET2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FLT3-ITD&lt;/i&gt; mutations, in agreement with our MARLIN classification (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig8"&gt;8c–f&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig17"&gt;9g–i&lt;/a&gt;). Similar observations were made for prospective cases three to five, which received confident classifications for the HOXA/B-activated group 3 AML (after 590 min), the HOXA9-activated T-ALL (after 96 min) and the AML Chromatin/spliceosome-enriched methylation classes (after 135 min), compatible with subsequent pathology results and genetic analyses (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z#Fig18"&gt;10a–c&lt;/a&gt;). In conclusion, we provide proof of concept for rapid acute leukemia diagnosis in the clinic, highlighting the potential of MARLIN and nanopore sequencing to greatly accelerate diagnostic workflows for patients presenting with acute leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-8" data-title="Real-time classification of a second prospective case."&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b id="Fig8" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text"&gt;Fig. 8: Real-time classification of a second prospective case.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__figure-content"&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__figure-item"&gt;&lt;a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/articles/s41588-025-02321-z/figures/8" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41588-025-02321-z/MediaObjects/41588_2025_2321_Fig8_HTML.png?as=webp"&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby="Fig8" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41588-025-02321-z/MediaObjects/41588_2025_2321_Fig8_HTML.png" alt="figure 8" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-8-desc"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;, Diagnostic timeline for patient RTC_002. &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;, Line graph showing MARLIN prediction scores.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cats, dust mites, mold, trees; for people with allergies, even a brief whiff of the airborne allergens these organisms produce can lead to swollen eyes, itchy skin and impaired breathing.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;Such allergens can persist indoors for months after the original source is gone, and repeated exposure can exacerbate, and even lead to, asthma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you could just flip a switch and disable them? You can, according to new University of Colorado Boulder research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have found that we can use a passive, generally safe ultraviolet light treatment to quickly inactivate &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/airborne+allergens/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;airborne allergens&lt;/a&gt;," said study author Tess Eidem, a senior research associate in the Department of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We believe this could be another tool for helping people fight allergens in their home, schools or other places where allergens accumulate indoors."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were published in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsestair.5c00080" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;ACS ES&amp;amp;T Air&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why you can't kill an allergen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walk into a room with a cat and, if you sneeze, it's not actually the cat you are reacting to. It's likely airborne flecks of a protein called Fel d1 produced in their saliva. The protein spreads when they lick themselves and ends up in microscopic flakes of dead skin floating in the air, a.k.a. dander. When we inhale these particles, our immune system produces antibodies that bind to the protein's unique 3D structure, kicking off an allergic reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogs, mice, &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/dust+mites/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dust mites&lt;/a&gt;, mold and plants all emit their own unique proteins, with their own unique structure. Unlike bacteria and viruses, these allergens can't be killed because they were never alive.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"After those dust mites are long gone, the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/allergen/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;allergen&lt;/a&gt; is still there," said Eidem. "That's why, if you shake out a rug, you can have a reaction years later."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard methods of reducing allergens—like vacuuming, washing walls, using an air filter and regularly bathing pets—can work OK but are hard to maintain long-term studies show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eidem and co-authors Mark Hernandez, a professor of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering, and Kristin Rugh, a microbiologist in the lab, sought a simpler way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of eliminating the proteins that cause allergies, they sought to change their structure—much like unfolding an origami animal—so the immune system wouldn't recognize them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If your &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/immune+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; is used to a swan and you unfold the protein so it no longer looks like a swan, you won't mount an allergic response," explained Eidem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UV light, their study suggests, can do that.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;Let there be light&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://phys.org/news/2021-10-specific-uv-wavelength-low-cost-safe.html"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that UV light can kill airborne microorganisms, including the virus that causes COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's already used widely to disinfect equipment in hospitals, airports and elsewhere, but the bandwidth is typically so strong (a wavelength of 254 nanometers) that users must wear &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/protective+equipment/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;protective equipment&lt;/a&gt; to prevent damage to skin and eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eidem used 222-nanometer-wavelength lights, a less-intense alternative considered safe for occupied spaces because it doesn't penetrate deep into cells. (It does not come entirely without risks, including ozone production, she notes, so exposure should be limited.)&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team pumped microscopic aerosolized allergens from mites, pet dander, mold and pollen into an unoccupied and sealed &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/today/2023/02/23/unique-bioaerosol-lab-dedicated-students-made-covid-research-possible" target="_blank"&gt;350-cubic-foot chamber&lt;/a&gt;. Then they switched on four lunchbox-sized UV222 lamps on the ceiling and floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they sampled the air at 10-minute intervals and compared it to untreated, allergen-filled air via &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/laboratory+tests/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;laboratory tests&lt;/a&gt;, they saw significant differences. In the treated samples, immunorecognition was reduced, meaning the antibodies no longer recognized many of the proteins and stuck to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After just 30 minutes, airborne allergen levels effectively decreased by about 20% to 25% on average, the study showed. Efficacy depended on the type of allergen, how long the light was on and what the allergen was floating in (dust, dander, liquid droplets, etc.) In one condition tested, after 40 minutes of UV light exposure, the cat allergen Fel d 1 had decreased by 61% compared to untreated air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Those are pretty rapid reductions when you compare them to months and months of cleaning, ripping up carpet, and bathing your cat," said Eidem.&lt;/p&gt;

																																			&lt;h2&gt;A portable allergy buster?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UV222 lights are already commercially available, mostly for industrial antimicrobial uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Eidem envisions a day when companies could engineer portable versions for people to switch on when they visit a friend with a pet or clean out a dusty basement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UV222 systems could also potentially protect workers frequently exposed to allergens, such as those who work around &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/live+animals/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;live animals&lt;/a&gt; or in cannabis grow houses where, her own research shows, allergic reactions can be deadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-in-three adults and children in the United States have allergies, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Eidem hopes her research, and more to come, can provide them with some relief—or even save lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Asthma attacks kill about 10 people every day in the United States, and they are often triggered by airborne allergies," she said. "Trying to develop new ways to prevent that exposure is really important."&lt;/p&gt;

The research, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1028415X.2025.2558118" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Nutritional Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, found that lower creatine intake was associated with greater depression severity, more frequent suicidal thoughts, and higher anxiety symptoms. While the results are not definitive, they point toward a potential role for creatine-rich diets in supporting psychological well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatine is a compound made naturally by the human body, but it is also found in certain foods, especially animal-based proteins like meat, poultry, and fish. It plays a key role in maintaining energy levels in cells, including in the brain. The average adult needs about two grams of creatine per day, roughly half of which is typically obtained from diet. While creatine is most commonly known as a supplement used by athletes to improve muscle performance, research has been expanding into its effects on brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have suggested that creatine may support cognitive function and may even reduce the risk of depression, particularly in older adults. Some small clinical trials have explored creatine as a treatment for depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. However, no large-scale study had examined its effects across a general population that includes both adolescents and adults, or outside of a Western context. The new study aimed to fill that gap by focusing on individuals living in South Korea, where dietary patterns differ significantly from the United States and other Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study is part of a larger, ongoing research program aimed at understanding the potential role of food-derived creatine in public health nutrition,” explained study author Sergej M. Ostojic, a professor of nutrition at the University of Agder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over the past several years, we have explored various health risks associated with low dietary creatine intake, including its links to impaired cognitive function in older adults and an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Personally, I am particularly interested in investigating how dietary creatine intake relates to mental health outcomes, given my background as a physician trained in psychiatry. This intersection of nutrition and mental health represents an exciting and understudied area with significant implications for prevention and treatment strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used data from the 2022 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a government-led initiative that gathers health and nutrition information from a representative sample of the population. In this analysis, they included 5,257 participants aged 12 and older who had provided complete dietary intake information and underwent at least one mental health assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily creatine intake was calculated based on the types and amounts of food reported by each participant, focusing on known creatine-rich sources such as meat and dairy. The researchers excluded any creatine obtained through supplements. They then grouped participants into four levels—or quartiles—based on their creatine intake per kilogram of body weight. These ranged from the lowest intake group (3.71 milligrams or less per kilogram of body weight per day) to the highest group (more than 13.80 milligrams per kilogram).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health outcomes were assessed using several standard questionnaires. Depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and anxiety was measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7). Participants were also asked about their experience of suicidal thoughts, suicide planning, suicide attempts, and whether they had received mental health counseling in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers applied a variety of statistical models to examine the relationships between creatine intake and mental health outcomes. These models accounted for factors such as age, gender, household income, education level, physical activity, smoking, sleep, and overall nutritional intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mean creatine intake for the full sample was 10.3 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day, which is relatively low compared to levels reported in Western populations. The researchers found that people in the lowest quartile of dietary creatine intake consistently showed worse mental health outcomes across multiple measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study confirmed and reinforced the findings of previous epidemiological and interventional research on creatine, providing further evidence of its potential role in mental health,” Ostojic told PsyPost. “Importantly, we expanded the scope of investigation beyond prior studies, which were predominantly conducted in U.S. populations, by examining a non-U.S. cohort.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition, our analysis included participants across a broader age spectrum, encompassing not only adults and older individuals but also adolescents. This wider demographic perspective offers valuable insights into the relationship between dietary creatine intake and mental health outcomes across different life stages and cultural dietary patterns, thereby strengthening the generalizability and relevance of our findings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, depression scores among those in the lowest quartile of dietary creatine intake were higher than those in the higher intake groups. The prevalence of clinically significant depression was also highest in this group at 6.9 percent, compared to 3.3 to 4.3 percent in the other quartiles. Suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts within the past year were also more commonly reported by participants in the lowest intake group, and the prevalence of these outcomes tended to decrease across higher creatine intake levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anxiety symptoms showed a similar pattern, though the evidence was less consistent. While the highest creatine consumers had slightly lower anxiety scores, the relationship was statistically significant only when adjusting for age, gender, education, and income. Once additional factors such as exercise and other nutrients were taken into account, the association between creatine and anxiety became weaker and was no longer statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When looking at daily stress levels, the researchers found that higher creatine intake was associated with a greater likelihood of reporting mild or no stress, and a lower likelihood of reporting severe stress. This trend remained even after adjusting for basic demographic variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe that creatine obtained from dietary sources—found exclusively in animal-based foods—may offer modest protective effects against several mental health conditions, as observed in the Korean population studied, including depression and anxiety,” Ostojic explained. “However, creatine should not be viewed as a ‘magic bullet’ for mental health. Rather, it may serve as one important component of a balanced, nutrient-rich diet aimed at supporting brain function and psychological well-being.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Creatine likely plays a supportive role by enhancing brain energy metabolism, which is essential for optimal neuronal activity and resilience under stress. In addition, its potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties may help reduce oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, both of which are implicated in mood disorders. Through these mechanisms, creatine could contribute to maintaining neurotransmitter balance and overall mental vitality, complementing other lifestyle and therapeutic interventions for mental health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, like all research, includes some caveats. Because the study was cross-sectional, it only provides a snapshot in time and cannot prove that low creatine intake causes depression or other mental health problems. People who are already experiencing poor mental health may eat less or have less balanced diets, which could influence their creatine intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation involves how creatine intake was measured. The calculations relied on average creatine content in various food groups, without distinguishing between different types of meat or preparation methods. Additionally, important variables such as genetic risk, use of psychiatric medications, and environmental stressors were not fully captured in the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Future longitudinal studies are needed to clarify these relationships,” Ostojic said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the researchers see the findings as an important step toward understanding the broader role of diet in mental health. They suggest that creatine could be an overlooked nutrient with potential benefits for psychological well-being, especially in populations that consume low levels of meat or animal-based products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My research group is dedicated to advancing the understanding of creatine as a semi-essential nutrient with broad relevance for public health,” Ostojic explained. “Our aim is to rigorously investigate creatine’s role in supporting normal energy metabolism across the entire population, moving beyond its traditional view as merely a dietary supplement for athletes or muscle performance. We emphasize that creatine is not just important for skeletal muscle but also plays a critical role in brain function and neurodevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adequate creatine availability is essential for maintaining neuronal energy balance, supporting cognitive processes, and fostering healthy brain maturation, particularly during periods of rapid growth such as childhood and adolescence. By reframing creatine as a key nutrient rather than solely a sports supplement, our work seeks to highlight its potential for preventing deficiencies and promoting lifelong metabolic and neurological health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many populations may be at risk of inadequate creatine intake from food sources, including vegans, vegetarians, the elderly, and individuals following restrictive diets,” Ostojic continued. “These groups could benefit most from increasing their consumption of creatine-rich foods to support mental well-being. Ideally, they should first consider adjusting their dietary patterns to include more animal-based foods, such as fish, which is an excellent natural source of creatine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alternatively, they can turn to creatine-fortified foods or dietary supplements to correct deficiencies and ensure sufficient intake of this important nutrient, which plays a key role in maintaining brain function and overall neurological health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1028415X.2025.2558118" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dietary creatine intake and mental health among the Korean population&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Sergej M. Ostojic, Sonja Baltic, and Dragana Zanini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 10:03:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxOcVdWMV9MX2Q2aVh5NUJ1OExxRmQ0SWQydjNJd3dYX25VeVB5ZGxBeHNUSElIZ294YmlyMkM2aDQyQXZRTi11RlFEZkRfWW9KN1NyNms1TVNHbWJOWFM3cVl6amlnZGQtZWN2SWJvNnJybjhQNWQ4Zk5vbEdscWo4RlRwSkpMaWs5aERrdUJscHdJUG5oZkcwZA</guid></item><item><title>类风湿性关节炎使她被囚禁。这个神经刺激器让她自由了。- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/22/nx-s1-5544463/rheumatoid-arthritis-new-device-nerve-stimulator</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                Lynn Milam says that a nerve-stimulating implant has dramatically improved her rheumatoid arthritis, allowing her and her husband, Donald, to regain the life they once enjoyed together.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;For more than four years, Lynn Milam's life was bound by the pain that radiated from her swollen joints.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"My children could not hug me," she says. "I couldn't hold my husband's hand."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Milam also couldn't climb stairs or help raise her teenage son. She spent most days on the couch.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The reason was &lt;a href="https://rheumatology.org/patients/rheumatoid-arthritis" target="_blank"&gt;rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt;, which occurs when the immune system starts attacking the lining of joints.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Milam tried everything: physical therapy, acupuncture, steroids and even the latest &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsarthritis.org/arthritis-info/rheumatoid-arthritis/ra-treatment/" target="_blank"&gt;immune drugs&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing worked.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That changed in October of 2023, when a surgeon implanted an &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/search/?query=rheumatoid%20arthritis&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;sortType=bestMatch" target="_blank"&gt;experimental device&lt;/a&gt; in Milam's neck. For a minute each morning, it delivers pulses of electricity to her vagus nerve, which connects the brain with internal organs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-89656" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                This device, when attached to the vagus nerve, can dramatically reduce symptoms in patients with some of the most severe cases of rheumatoid arthritis.

                &lt;b class="hide-caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;hide caption&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"Three weeks in, my elbow pain was completely gone," she says. "Then my hands didn't hurt anymore, the swelling started going away."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Eventually, all symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis had vanished. Milam, 60, says she and her husband have regained the life they enjoyed before she got sick.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"It's like a rebirth," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And now, the device will be available to many other people like Milam.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In July, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://setpointmedical.com/setpoint-medical-receives-fda-approval-for-novel-neuroimmune-modulation-therapy-for-rheumatoid-arthritis/" target="_blank"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; the device, made by SetPoint Medical, for people with rheumatoid arthritis whose symptoms aren't adequately controlled by drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On Aug. 22, surgeons at Northwell Health in New York &lt;a href="https://www.northwell.edu/news/northwell-first-to-offer-setpoint-system-for-rheumatoid-arthritis-patients" target="_blank"&gt;implanted&lt;/a&gt; the first approved device in a patient.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-89668" class="bucketwrap image medium"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                Milam says the stimulator has restored her ability to climb stairs, cook and travel.

                &lt;b class="hide-caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;hide caption&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


            &lt;b class="toggle-caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;toggle caption&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The FDA approval could be a turning point for the treatment of not only rheumatoid arthritis, but other autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This treatment is using the body's own mechanism of managing inflammation," says &lt;a href="https://www.azarthritis.com/aara-physicians/tesser-john/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. John Tesser&lt;/a&gt;, a rheumatologist in Phoenix who oversaw the study that led to the device's approval.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By stimulating the vagus nerve, the device sends a signal to the hypothalamus, a brain area that regulates bodily functions and interacts with the immune system. That brain area responds by sending signals back down the vagus nerve to the spleen.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The signals instruct certain cells in the spleen to slow down production of proteins called cytokines, which regulate inflammation, including inflammation in the joints. Cytokines play an important role in fighting infection, but can also trigger damage to healthy tissues, including the lining of joints.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The device rarely produces the sort of dramatic recovery that Lynn Milam experienced. But the pivotal clinical trial found that patients who had not responded to even the most powerful drugs often saw meaningful improvement.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Thirty-five percent of the patients did achieve that in this very difficult-to-treat group," Tesser says. That was significantly more than in a comparison group whose stimulators had not yet been switched on.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The entire process is initiated by an implant "the size of a lima bean," says &lt;a href="https://rni.wvumedicine.org/about-rni/leadership/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Peter Konrad&lt;/a&gt;, chair of neurosurgery at the Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute at West Virginia University. "Everything's all built on a little chip and then it's contained in a little silicon jacket."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The outpatient surgery to implant the device is straightforward for any surgeon who has implanted vagus nerve stimulators often used to control epileptic seizures, Konrad says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"I've had dental surgery that was more of a process than this surgery was," Milam says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After the surgery, though, there was a hitch.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because the device sits so close to the vocal cords, Milam's voice was temporarily limited to a whisper. A second procedure fixed that but left her voice slightly lower than it had been.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Milam says she'll accept that for a treatment that did what drugs couldn't.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The stimulator has restored her ability to climb stairs, cook and travel, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Her husband, Donald Milam, says it's also allowing the couple to do things together again.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Walking the dogs, holding hands — just the simple things," he says. "And hugs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Habit, not conscious choice, drives most of our actions, according to new research from the University of Surrey, University of South Carolina and Central Queensland University.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The research, &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08870446.2025.2561149" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Psychology &amp;amp; Health&lt;/i&gt;, found that two-thirds of our daily behaviors are initiated "on autopilot", out of habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habits are actions that we are automatically prompted to do when we encounter everyday settings, due to associations that we have learned between those settings and our usual responses to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research also found that 46% of behaviors were both triggered by habit and aligned with conscious intentions, suggesting that people form habits that support their &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/personal+goals/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;personal goals&lt;/a&gt;, and often disrupt habits that conflict with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there have been previous attempts to estimate the prevalence of habits in our day-to-day lives, this study used a new method to capture habits in action. The international research team surveyed 105 participants from the UK and Australia, sending six random prompts to their phones each day for a week, asking them to describe what they were currently doing, and whether it was triggered out of habit or done intentionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found that 65% of daily behaviors were habitually initiated, meaning people were prompted to do them out of routine rather than making a conscious decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Benjamin Gardner, Professor of Psychology at the University of Surrey and co-author of the study, said, "Our research shows that while people may consciously want to do something, the actual initiation and performance of that behavior is often done without thinking, driven by non-conscious habits. This suggests that 'good' habits may be a powerful way to make our goals a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"For people who want to break their bad habits, simply telling them to 'try harder' isn't enough. To create lasting change, we must incorporate strategies to help people recognize and disrupt their unwanted habits, and ideally form positive new ones in their place."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings may have broader implications for public health and wellness interventions. The researchers recommend that initiatives designed to help people adopt new behaviors, like exercising or eating healthier, should focus on building new, positive habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, for someone trying to take up exercise, inconsistent exercising may not be enough. The most effective strategy would involve identifying an everyday situation in which exercise can realistically be done—for example, at a certain time of day, or following a regular event, like leaving work—and consistently doing some exercise in that situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, to break a bad habit like smoking, simply wanting to quit may not cut it. The most effective strategies would involve disrupting triggers (e.g. avoiding places where they used to smoke) and creating new routines (e.g. chewing gum after a meal instead of having a cigarette).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Amanda Rebar, Associate Professor at the University of South Carolina and lead author of the study said, "People like to think of themselves as rational decision makers, who think carefully about what to do before they do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"However, much of our repetitive behavior is undertaken with minimal forethought and is instead generated automatically, by habit."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Dr. Grace Vincent, Sleep Scientist and Associate Professor at Central Queensland University and co-author of the study, said the findings offer hope to people trying to develop healthier lifestyles. "Our study shows that two-thirds of what people do each day is sparked by habit, and most of the time those habits are also aligned with our intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This means that if we set out to create a positive habit, whether that's around better sleep hygiene, or nutrition, or general well-being improvements, we can rely on an internal 'autopilot' to take over and help us maintain those habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately, not all habits are created equal. Exercise was the exception in our findings, as it was often triggered by &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/habit/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;habit&lt;/a&gt;, but less likely to be achieved purely on autopilot, compared to other behaviors."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) met last week to review part of the agency’s vaccine schedule. The independent panel considered proposed changes to recommendations for the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine; hepatitis B vaccine; and COVID vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, hundreds of laws and regulations across virtually &lt;a href="https://www.astho.org/topic/resource/impact-of-acip-recommendations-on-state-law/"&gt;every state&lt;/a&gt; and several U.S. territories have incorporated the recommendations of the panel. But Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://thedispatch.com/article/rfk-vaccine-advisory-panel-new-members/"&gt;overhauled&lt;/a&gt; the panel in June and stocked it with like-minded vaccine skeptics, prompting medical associations and states to begin &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/nyregion/northeast-public-health-collaborative-trump.html"&gt;unwinding&lt;/a&gt; their reliance ACIP guidance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;    


&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Thursday-Friday meeting—the second since Kennedy took the unprecedented step of firing all 17 previous ACIP members and the first since he added five additional members just days earlier—further splintered the previous consensus about who should get what vaccines, and when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers, medical associations, and former public health officials had feared that the re-made committee would narrow or remove recommendations for some vaccines at the meeting last week, not on the basis of new scientific findings or data, but in furtherance of the secretary’s anti-vaccine agenda. Indeed, the recently fired CDC Director Susan Monarez testified before Congress last week that Kennedy had asked her to commit to rubber-stamping whatever the committee decided regardless of the scientific evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the meeting were a mixed bag. ACIP tabled a planned vote to recommend delaying the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine from birth to at least 1 month of age if the mother tests negative for the disease. But the committee rescinded its recommendation for the combination MMRV vaccine for children under age 4. The recommendation for a two-shot series of a separate MMR vaccine and chickenpox (varicella) vaccine for young children remained unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel also revoked the recommendation encouraging routine COVID vaccination and replaced it with language recommending that individuals 6 months and older consult with health care providers, a practice known as shared clinical decision-making (&lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-update-healthcare-professionals/newsletter/shared-clinical-decision-making-what-it-and-why-it-matters"&gt;SCDM&lt;/a&gt;), about COVID immunization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the difference? As the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/vaccine-recommendations/shared-clinical-decision-making.html#:~:text=The%20key%20distinction,decision%2Dmaking%20process."&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; on its site, a routine recommendation’s guidance is that “the default decision should be to vaccinate the patient based on age group or other indication, unless contraindicated. For shared clinical decision-making recommendations, there is no default.” A member of ACIP’s COVID work group &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-09-18-19/11-perlman-bernstein-miglis-covid-508.pdf"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; during the meeting that under SCDM, “vaccination is often interpreted as optional.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel split 6-6 on a separate vote to require a prescription to get a COVID vaccine; the committee’s chair, Martin Kulldorff, broke the tie by voting no. Some members &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/_9ChY9SpPlY?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=22106"&gt;appeared&lt;/a&gt; unaware of how a prescription requirement would impact vaccine access. Kulldorff also &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/_9ChY9SpPlY?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=23189"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; during the meeting that the committee doesn’t have the authority to establish a prescription requirement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shift in recommendations stops short of removing the vaccine from the schedule entirely, and HHS has said in &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/acip-recommends-covid19-vaccination-individual-decision-making.html#:~:text=Individual%20decision%2Dmaking%20is,federal%20Health%20Insurance%20Marketplace."&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; that insurers would continue to cover vaccination. But in the immediate aftermath of the meeting, it is &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/19/kennedys-vaccine-advisers-vote-to-remove-blanket-recommendation-that-older-americans-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-00573309#:~:text=The%20practical%20implications,Hard%20to%20say.%E2%80%9D"&gt;unclear&lt;/a&gt; exactly how the new guidance will affect vaccine access. Multiple committee members themselves &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/_9ChY9SpPlY?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=21249"&gt;voiced confusion&lt;/a&gt; on what their votes actually meant for healthy people and for vulnerable populations trying to get vaccinated. How the panel’s changes affect access to vaccines will vary by location and how state laws integrate ACIP recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A further complicating factor is that the Food and Drug Administration’s approvals for the latest COVID vaccines, issued in August, are narrower than the new ACIP guidance, limiting approved eligibility to people over 65 or those with risky underlying conditions. The FDA’s limits have already made it harder for many people to get a vaccine without an “off-label” prescription from a doctor. The diverging and unclear guidance had already resulted in &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/11/states-rfk-vaccine-access-cost-00556969"&gt;widespread confusion&lt;/a&gt; among state governments and pharmacies trying to preserve access and led to even people within the eligible groups being unable to get the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health experts &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/health/cdc-vaccines-mmrv-hepatitis-b.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CTabling%20the%20vote%20is%20appropriate%20and%20a%20relief%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Dr.%20Noele%20P.%20Nelson%2C%20a%20senior%20author%20on%20the%20current%20guidelines%20for%20the%20vaccine%20and%20a%20former%20leader%20of%20the%20C.D.C.%E2%80%99s%20hepatitis%20vaccines%20work%20group."&gt;expressed&lt;/a&gt; relief that infant access to the hepatitis B immunization was unchanged and that the recommendation for the MMR and varicella vaccines was not rolled back even if the option of the MMRV combo shot is now set to be removed from the schedule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s kind of like low intensity, what they did in some ways. … [O]nly 15 percent of kids took the combo,” Demetre Daskalakis, the former director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in an interview with the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s more the principle, that they—with no data, with no reason to do it—have just removed a vaccine from the pediatric schedule.”   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the two-day meeting in Atlanta highlighted how successful Kennedy has been in supplanting scientific decision-making and evidence-based evaluation with rote vaccine skepticism. Many of the panel members’ statements and presentations suggest ACIP will continue on a trajectory away from consensus and data-driven vaccine analysis and toward a vaccine-skeptical agenda marked by increased confusion and polarization.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff, an epidemiologist who has served as a paid expert witness in litigation against vaccine manufacturers, opened the meeting by laying down a gauntlet to the committee’s critics. “When there are different scientific views, only trust scientists who are willing to engage with and publicly debate the scientists with other views,” he said. “With such debates, you can weigh and determine the scientific reasoning by each side, but without it, you cannot properly judge their arguments.” He cited an &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/01/opinion/cdc-leaders-kennedy.html"&gt;op-ed&lt;/a&gt; authored by nine former CDC directors criticizing Kennedy and ACIP, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/-6uBNXsYRHQ?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=2678"&gt;challenging&lt;/a&gt; them to a public debate: “If they want to be trusted, they should accept.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broad vaccine policy or public health goals are topics appropriate for an open debate setting. But evaluating highly technical and scientifically complex studies and safety data is not an exercise well-suited to the debating stage, but rather, a structured, collaborative discussion where different perspectives and questions can be explored on a foundation of validated and accepted evidence—something the ACIP and its working groups were previously known for and had formalized through its evidence-to-recommendation &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/media/pdfs/2024/09/ACIP-Evidence-to-Recommendations-Framework-cdc.pdf"&gt;framework&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Kennedy remade ACIP in June, the panel abandoned that process, including much of the public transparency that came with it. The details of the proposed changes the committee would be voting on, for example, were not announced publicly before the meeting last week began—in fact, CDC staff preparing materials for the meeting apparently &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/-6uBNXsYRHQ?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=23600"&gt;didn’t know&lt;/a&gt; the specifics of some proposals until the night before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several committee liaisons representing outside medical groups during the meeting asked why ACIP is considering new recommendations for these vaccines in the first place. Prior to Kennedy’s installment at HHS, ACIP would schedule votes on changes to recommendations when new circumstances (e.g., a public health emergency or a new vaccine) or new data and studies arose that prompted reconsideration. The process for developing a potential new recommendation or change to an existing one would often take the better part of a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The absence of that process was clear throughout the meeting but particularly when it came to  the proposal to push the hepatitis B vaccine birth dose for infants back to 1 month of age. Members seeming to favor the change did not offer new safety evidence justifying the shift nor did they make clear why 1 month was selected. “Why would we pick 1 month, why [not] 2 months?” asked Cody Meissner, a vaccine expert and pediatrician who’s also the only current ACIP member who has served on the panel before. “There is no evidence that it’s safer at a later time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s no evidence of harm from administering the neonatal vaccine that I’ve heard presented or that I’m aware of,” he added.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Is there really a reason that the committee can provide for making a change?” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/-6uBNXsYRHQ?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=20172"&gt;pressed&lt;/a&gt; Flor Muñoz, a pediatrician and ACIP liaison representing the Infectious Diseases Society of America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the meeting, committee member Robert Malone addressed the query. “I think the question in my mind is a little disingenuous,” he said. “The signal that is prompting this is not one of safety, it’s one of trust. It’s one of parents being uncomfortable with this medical procedure being performed at birth.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malone added that “hopefully, [parents] are comforted by the data that have been provided, but I suspect that many concerns will linger.” He also noted that he had received no communication from anyone at CDC as to why ACIP was reviewing the hepatitis B recommendation now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the comments also highlighted what was on display throughout the meeting: the elevation of vaccine skepticism for skepticism’s sake, even in the face of contradictory evidence. While CDC staff presented a systematic review of data on the hepatitis B vaccine, noting strong evidence indicating its safety, Malone insisted, “The absence of data that statistically proves lack of safety does not mean that the product is safe.” Retsef Levi, a professor of operations management at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, advanced a similar line.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infectious disease experts and former public health officials panned the members’ comments as removed from scientific reality. “You can’t prove absolute safety—that’s proving a negative,” Jake Scott, an infectious disease physician and clinical associate professor at Stanford University, &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1969063501290483928"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; on X in response to Malone’s comments. “We don’t have ‘absence of data.’ We have mountains of evidence. You’re demanding logical impossibilities while ignoring decades of proof.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Frieden, the CDC director during the Obama administration, &lt;a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-173993005"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt;, “There were statements that ‘concerns’ and ‘trust’ are more important than data—including by members who themselves, or whose organizations, have been primary disseminators of disinformation about vaccines.” Kennedy’s new picks seemed to be doing exactly what he has long accused the public health establishment of doing: substituting personal priors and ideology for sound science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee’s discussion of COVID vaccine information also frustrated observers, as when Levi raised concerns about mRNA used in the shots lingering in the body after vaccination. Drew Weissman, the director of vaccine research at the University of Pennsylvania’s medical school and a recipient of the 2023 Nobel Prize for work that helped lead to the development of the COVID vaccines, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/20/drew-weissman-nobel-prize-mrna-covid-vaccines-rebuts-retsef-levi-claims/#:~:text=What%20these%20people,just%20not%20true."&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the claims rely on cherry-picked research and bad information. “What these people do, is that they search, they find one paper or two papers that make an outlandish claim based on bad data that hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of other papers refute, they don’t mention everything that refutes it,” he told &lt;em&gt;Stat &lt;/em&gt;in an interview after the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some panel members veered into anecdotes and speculation about vaccine safety effects while committee liaisons and even other panel members emphasized the lack of data to support their colleagues’ assertions. “We’re going beyond data and turning into a discussion of speculation and a discussion of possible clinical outcomes for which we have no data,” Joseph Hibbeln, a neuroscientist who previously worked at the National Institutes of Health, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/-6uBNXsYRHQ?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=18842"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; during the discussion of the hepatitis B vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And during both days, confusion among the committee members was apparent, with some uncertain of what exactly they were voting on, how the voting procedures worked, or even what effects their decisions would have on vaccine policy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the panel voted to preserve access to the MMRV combo shot under the Vaccines for Children Program, which subsidizes vaccines for uninsured or underinsured families, even though the move conflicted with its previous vote to drop the recommendation for the combo shot. Committee members opened the second day of the meeting explaining that they were confused and had made the vote in error. As Kulldorff, the committee chair, prepared to reverse the vote, he praised the “enormous depth and knowledge” the panel possessed on vaccines and science but noted that nearly all of the members “are rookies” on the panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are many technical issues that we might not grasp as of yet,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;        
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Dispatch</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 09:26:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE5fNGJsSHlQQVpMVnFFa3o1eDRqMG9acHBYNF80VE9yLXBfTWRZdW0yRTJZTTVncHBmSXc2aVZUU2VYVHFpSy1YU2JFR1EtZHE0dk0wWmp0MWtZejZUYTlKbW1PbmdReHVjSFN5aGh5TmpkUjNVc1A5ZTBOVQ</guid></item><item><title>专家说，在饮食中加入这种成分可以帮助您过上更长寿、更健康的生活-《独立报》</title><link>https://www.independent.co.uk/health-and-fitness/polyphenols-benefits-and-anti-ageing-effects-b2831125.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 eWHDRo sc-jbiisr-1 sc-1wfc891-0 fooWDH" id="main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="big-letter"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;ietary advice often hinges on eating less. In the rare instance we are told to eat more of something, the subject nowadays is invariably &lt;a href="/topic/protein"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="/topic/fibre"&gt;fibre&lt;/a&gt;. But there is another naturally occurring dietary compound – present in berries, green tea, coffee and even dark chocolate – which recent research suggests can have geroprotective effects. In layman’s terms: it may help protect against, or slow down, the biological processes involved in &lt;a href="/topic/ageing"&gt;ageing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Polyphenols are a large family of plant compounds,” explains Dr Karan Rajan, a medical doctor and author of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?tsid=3658&amp;amp;platform=independentcouk_web&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FThis-Book-Save-Your-Life%2Fdp%2F1529136326%3Fascsubtag%3DIN%7C2831125%7C1529136326%7Cindependentcouk_web"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Book May Save Your Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This includes flavonoids like EGCG [epigallocatechin gallate] in green tea, phenolic acids such as chlorogenic acid in coffee, and many others. They act as antioxidants with anti-inflammatory properties.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A review article, published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568163725000790"&gt;Ageing Research Reviews&lt;/a&gt; journal in 2025, suggested that “polyphenols may exert geroprotective effects by modulating the hallmarks of ageing” after observing a high consumption of polyphenol-rich foods in “blue zones” – five regions across the world where people have been observed to live significantly longer, healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does this mean you, too, could increase your lifespan by including a few more berries and cups of green tea in your weekly routine? As always, the answer is more nuanced than that. Here, a team of nutritional and medical experts unpick the extent of polyphenol’s health-boosting properties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the research say about polyphenols? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original blue zones are Sardinia in Italy, Okinawa in Japan, Ikaria in Greece, Nicoya in Costa Rica and Loma Linda in California. With longevity a hot topic in the 21st century, these regions have been subject to many headlines and books exploring the correlates between the lifestyles and lifespans of their populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/704080v3"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; by demographer Dr Saul Justin Newman questioned the concept of blue zones due to bad data, such as the absence of birth certificates in the highlighted regions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Only 18 per cent of ‘exhaustively’ validated supercentenarians [those aged significantly above 100 – usually 110] have a birth certificate, falling to zero per cent in the USA, and supercentenarian birthdates are concentrated on days divisible by five: a pattern indicative of widespread fraud and error,” it reports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2025 review article on polyphenols uses long-lived individuals living in these blue zones, who remain free from chronic diseases, as a “valuable model to investigate the complex interplay of biological, genetic and environmental factors that contribute to exceptional longevity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It recognises that, while centenarians are inclined towards polyphenol-rich plant-based diets, longevity is not just determined through diet but also a blend of lifestyle and socio-cultural factors. It also lists a series of limitations, such as a lack of data around the exact polyphenol intake of those living in the blue zones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it does identify “associations between higher polyphenol consumption and the lower incidence of age-related diseases in these populations”, adding that “a significant body of evidence suggests that polyphenols… may exhibit geroprotective activity by influencing underlying biological mechanisms of ageing and promoting optimal longevity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/japanese-walking-method-10000-steps-a-day-b2828117.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/heart-health-attack-cardio-exercise-b2785415.html"&gt;A cardiac nurse says these five daily behaviours can reduce your risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="7" class="sc-awdjp1-0 foHptA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/05/9/39/na-visky-3hRRT4qztzs-unsplash.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/05/9/39/na-visky-3hRRT4qztzs-unsplash.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/05/9/39/na-visky-3hRRT4qztzs-unsplash.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Green tea contains polyphenols in the form of flavonoids like EGCG" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-5180"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Green tea contains polyphenols in the form of flavonoids like EGCG&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Unsplash/@navisky)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, while the concept of blue zones has been called into question, the study concludes that evidence suggests polyphenols can still have a positive impact on the ageing process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our experts generally agree, but also point to other factors at play in deciding the length of someone’s life, and the health with which it is lived. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Populations in so-called ‘blue zones’ tend to eat diets naturally higher in polyphenols by up to 30 per cent, compared to the average diet,” says Dr Richard Allison, nutritionist at &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.herbalife.com/en-gb"&gt;Herbalife&lt;/a&gt;. “While it’s not the only factor – exercise, community and overall lifestyle play a role too – research suggests polyphenols may help explain some of their healthy ageing advantages.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a dietary perspective, a high intake of plant-based foods has been noted in these areas, which would provide a significant supply of polyphenols, as well as fibre and other key nutrients,” adds Kerry Beeson, a nutritional therapist with &lt;a rel="nofollow" data-affiliate="true" target="_blank" href="http://redirect.viglink.com?u=https%3A%2F%2Fprepkitchen.co.uk%2F&amp;amp;articleId=b2831125&amp;amp;key=5b1a6400a3c0d931ed2037885e1a27a3"&gt;Prep Kitchen&lt;/a&gt; who holds a degree in nutritional medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, blue zones are not the only regions with high plant food consumption, which suggests that polyphenols alone may not be the sole explanation. &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/gut-health-recipe-three-ingredients-muscles-nhs-surgeon-b2802823.html"&gt;Gut health&lt;/a&gt; has also been investigated as an important factor in longevity, for example. On that note, there may be an important synergy there, as polyphenols can act as prebiotics, working with dietary fibre and &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/gut-health-fermented-foods-kimchi-b2765194.html"&gt;fermented foods&lt;/a&gt; to support a diverse microbiome that in turn positively influences immunity, inflammation, and ultimately, healthy ageing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally, Dr Rajan points to links between diets high in polyphenols, such as the &lt;a href="/news/health/mediterranean-diet-gum-disease-weight-loss-b2826640.html"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; and blue zone diet, and cardiometabolic and anti-inflammatory benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, most evidence is observational, so we can’t isolate polyphenols as the sole driver of longevity,” he says. “Other factors such as genetics, sleep, activity levels, lower smoking and processed food intake all play big roles.

in coffee, ferulic acid in whole grains and gallic acid in tea, grapes and berries. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proanthocyanidins: found in fruits like grapes and apples, as well as cocoa and dark chocolate. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lignans: found in wholefoods such as flaxseeds and sesame seeds. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stilbenes: the most well-known polyphenol in this category is resveratrol in red grapes and wine. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Special cases: some polyphenols don’t fall into the main categories, such as curcumin, a unique curcuminoid found only in turmeric. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/best-healthy-habits-every-day-b2806102.html"&gt;Do these five things daily for 90 days to see a ‘profound difference’ in your health, fitness and energy levels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="7" class="sc-awdjp1-0 gPaeol"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/11/09/09125147-7a27edc5-f07e-4135-9adf-83b9c340d2b2.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/11/09/09125147-7a27edc5-f07e-4135-9adf-83b9c340d2b2.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/11/09/09125147-7a27edc5-f07e-4135-9adf-83b9c340d2b2.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Red wine contains polyphenols, although Dr Karan Rajan adds that ‘alcohol obviously has downsides for gut health and it is more generally linked to increased risk of cancers, so grapes are better’" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-5182"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Red wine contains polyphenols, although Dr Karan Rajan adds that ‘alcohol obviously has downsides for gut health and it is more generally linked to increased risk of cancers, so grapes are better’&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt;

They can help improve cardiometabolic function, support endothelial function (related to the lining of the blood vessels) and they have anti-inflammatory effects. Polyphenols may also aid lipid modulation and directly impact gut microbiome health, he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the gut, they exhibit prebiotic properties to feed “good bacteria”, and offer antimicrobial effects against pathogenic microorganisms (those capable of causing disease), Beeson explains, citing a 2019 review published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6770155/"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt; journal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She continues: “Polyphenols act as antioxidants, reducing oxidative stress and helping protect cells from damage. They have anti-inflammatory effects and &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6627994/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests they may support cardiovascular health, improve blood sugar control, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5925142/"&gt;boost immune function&lt;/a&gt; and lower the risk of developing chronic diseases like cancer and &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12391731/"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the potential perks don’t end there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They help lower blood pressure, improve cholesterol levels and protect arteries,” adds Dr Allison. &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;Some polyphenols cross into the brain to protect neurons, where they may protect memory and potentially slow age-related cognitive decline. They can improve how your body handles blood sugar, supporting energy balance and diabetes prevention, and polyphenols may slow some of the cellular processes linked with ageing, helping you stay healthier for longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/best-stretches-flexibility-daily-routine-b2806736.html"&gt;Five stretches you should be doing every day according to a flexibility expert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="7" class="sc-awdjp1-0 fnzsRm"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/04/10/27/iStock-1832639811.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/04/10/27/iStock-1832639811.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/04/10/27/iStock-1832639811.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Polyphenols can improve how your body handles blood sugar and support energy balance, says nutritionist Dr Richard Allison" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-5183"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Polyphenols can improve how your body handles blood sugar and support energy balance, says nutritionist Dr Richard Allison&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Which foods contain polyphenols?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’ll get polyphenols from a wide variety of plant-based foods,” says Dr Allison.

Of course, these benefits are also linked to regular dietary patterns consumed over long periods of time, rather than occasional intake of polyphenols.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Alison suggests aiming for a slightly higher total of 1,000mg per day, which he says is “usually sufficient to see visible benefits including general anti-inflammatory health and cardiovascular health”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is roughly the equivalent of a cup of berries, two to three cups of green tea or coffee and a small piece of dark chocolate plus, supplemented by regular intake of fruits, vegetables, nuts and olive oil throughout the day, he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’ll usually start noticing benefits like better energy, digestion, and recovery within a few weeks of consistent intake.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Rajan, on the other hand, suggests people should focus less on a specific amount or concentration of polyphenols, and more on overall dietary patterns to see improvements to their health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A Mediterranean-style diet is naturally rich in polyphenols,” he says. “Small daily choices, like opting for black coffee, snacking on a couple of squares of dark chocolate, eating some mixed berries and having olive oil with meals, will add up over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/longevity-ageing-exercise-personal-trainer-b2779460.html"&gt;I’m a trainer specialising in longevity – these are the five changes that have the biggest impact on my clients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="7" class="sc-awdjp1-0 cizAnP"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/07/06/20/iStock-155556909.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/07/06/20/iStock-155556909.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/07/06/20/iStock-155556909.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The benefits of small dietary changes, such as opting for black coffee, will add up over time, according to Dr Karan Rajan" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-5185"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;The benefits of small dietary changes, such as opting for black coffee, will add up over time, according to Dr Karan Rajan&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to enjoy a healthier diet rich in polyphenols&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Rajan says that, based on existing evidence, it is likely that polyphenols have geroprotective qualities. This is largely thanks to their positive impact on heart and blood vessel health, anti-inflammatory properties and benefits for the gut microbiome, according to Beeson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to incorporate more polyphenols into your weekly diet, consistency is key, Dr Allison advises. Below, our three experts share their top tips for doing so, as well as providing a few suggestions for improving the general quality of your diet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 dDVXDN jHvNZk"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Focus on dietary patterns, not supplements. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Combine polyphenol-rich foods such as coffee, berries, olive oil, nuts and cocoa with fibre – fibre is crucial as it feeds gut bacteria, which then transform polyphenols into beneficial compounds. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rotate and diversify plant foods and fibres for the best effect. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evidence for polyphenol supplements is weak compared to whole foods, so it’s always best to get polyphenols from natural food sources. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tips from Dr Richard Allison, nutritionist at &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.herbalife.com/en-gb"&gt;Herbalife&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 dDVXDN jHvNZk"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start your morning with green tea or coffee. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add a handful of berries to your breakfast or snacks. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swap butter for olive oil when cooking. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Snack on nuts and a square of dark chocolate. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add turmeric to meals such as soups, curries or even smoothies, along with a pinch of black pepper to boost absorption. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tips from Kerry Beeson BSc (nutritional medicine), nutritional therapist at &lt;a rel="nofollow" data-affiliate="true" target="_blank" href="http://redirect.viglink.com?u=https%3A%2F%2Fprepkitchen.co.uk%2F&amp;amp;articleId=b2831125&amp;amp;key=5b1a6400a3c0d931ed2037885e1a27a3"&gt;Prep Kitchen:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 dDVXDN jHvNZk"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Replace crisps and standard chocolate bars as snacks with a handful of nuts, some berries and a couple of squares of dark chocolate (70% cocoa and above). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The recommended daily intake of five portions of fruit and vegetables isn’t enough. Aim for at least seven, and try to eat different colours to vary the types of polyphenols you consume – the brighter the better. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make your own polyphenol-rich salad dressing with ingredients like extra virgin olive oil, pomegranate nectar and lemon juice. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swap syrups and sugar for honey and maple syrup – these are further sources of polyphenols. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have a cup or two of good quality tea or coffee each day – matcha green or white tea are the highest in polyphenols. Note that adding milk to your coffee lowers the absorption of polyphenols into your body, and it’s best taken warm, so an espresso shot is ideal. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Include fibre-rich plant-based protein sources such as beans, lentils and chickpeas in your diet, as well as wholegrains like oats, brown rice and wholemeal bread. These are a staple in blue zone diets and rich in polyphenols. They also contain fibre to support gut health. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add herbs and spices liberally when cooking. Fresh is best but dried versions are still useful sources. Also, consider using functional foods such as moringa and maca in smoothies and on cereal. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Incorporate fermented foods such as kefir, sauerkraut or kimchi in your diet regularly. These not only contain beneficial compounds themselves but also support gut bacteria that help metabolise polyphenols efficiently. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/gut-health-fermented-foods-kimchi-b2765194.html"&gt;I spoke to the man who wrote the book on fermentation – here is his golden rule for gut health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 09:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQT3pfOG1HdDZ3Q1pIMldtaVRIV3RDOVFzRGtIeDdyeGl0TWVQU1Izbi1VbmFmZ3hHU3JnZzZjU1lKUkNaQUNOTm5jTjBuRDF1RkxPdkNlWXRGX2I4OTVYR1BPSHUzcGFaN280VEUzd0RkNl9XOERrNWRXdXNtY2N5ZHdpQjdOMXF3UEFoNFJLT1VRTEVycmVrWFYxS2x3d3VWX2Q4R2xFMTNCamM</guid></item><item><title>美容和健康大师喜欢它。关于海苔的说法是下沉还是游泳？ - NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2025/09/22/nx-s1-5539099/sea-moss-supplements-health-nutrition-beauty</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

It's sea moss, the latest social media superfood.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sea moss is actually a generic term used to describe different red seaweed plants that grow in the North Atlantic, particularly off the Irish coast, as well as in warmer waters such as in parts of the Carribean, says &lt;a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/vanessa-king" target="_blank"&gt;Vanessa King&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietician and spokesperson for the American Academy of Dietetics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;King says you've probably eaten a sea moss product without knowing it. It's long been harvested for its carrageenan, which is used in the food industry as a thickening agent and emulsifier in products like ice cream and puddings, even nut milks.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;These days, you'll also find sea moss sold as pills, powders, gummies, dried flakes and often, as an edible gel made from sea moss that has been soaked in water.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;TikTok content creators and celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Hailey Bieber have embraced sea moss as part of their wellness and beauty routines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;All the buzz has translated into a global sea moss market that's projected to be worth nearly $3 billion by 2030, according to&lt;a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/sea-moss-market-report" target="_blank"&gt; an analysis by Grand View Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But does the evidence actually back up the hype?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The Claim&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On TikTok, you'll find content creators praising sea moss for &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@georgianingg/video/7330875726045957394" target="_blank"&gt;clearing their acne and giving them radiant skin&lt;/a&gt;, improving digestion, boosting energy and &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@maggieroseadvocate/video/7427520214532640042?lang=en&amp;amp;q=sea%20moss%20health%20benefits%20&amp;amp;t=1758236770552" target="_blank"&gt;helping with weight management and better sleep&lt;/a&gt;. In the Caribbean, sea moss is sometimes sold in a drink that's said to be a &lt;a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/foods/jamaican-irish-moss-drink#:~:text=Jamaica,behemoth%20known%20as%20Peanut%20Punch." target="_blank"&gt;male libido booster&lt;/a&gt;, King says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And in both Ireland and the Caribbean, you can find recipes dating back to the 1800s that treat sea moss as a form of food as medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The evidence&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Despite a long tradition of using sea moss for its alleged beauty and&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/15/nx-s1-5399181/from-fitness-fads-to-mental-health-trends-how-wellness-became-an-american-epidemic" target="_blank"&gt; wellness boosting &lt;/a&gt;properties, "we still don't have much research to support the health claims that our celebrities are endorsing," King says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Most of the claims are based on &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/Does-Eating-Sea-Moss-Provide-Health-Benefits.aspx#:~:text=Sea%20moss%20provides%20soluble%20fibers,systemic%20lipid%20and%20glucose%20metabolism." target="_blank"&gt;cell or animal studies&lt;/a&gt;, which don't always translate to humans. "Even the human trials that we have are small and of short duration," &lt;a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=15727" target="_blank"&gt;says Dr. Melinda Ring&lt;/a&gt;, the executive director of the Osher Center for Integrative Health at Northwestern University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's not to say sea moss has no health benefits. Ring says sea moss in its whole form is a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/09/19/1196977677/easy-ways-to-add-more-fiber-to-your-diet" target="_blank"&gt;good source of fiber&lt;/a&gt;, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals like zinc, which do support gut health and the immune system. But you can also get these nutrients from lots of other foods, not just sea moss.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So can it be potentially beneficial? Yes." Ring says. "Can it be more beneficial than other sources? Probably not. It's just one of many things that we can use to support our health."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She says there is emerging evidence that the prebiotic fibers in sea moss can support a healthy gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The risks&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Ring says consuming too much sea moss also poses potential risks. "One is that sea moss can accumulate heavy metals like arsenic, lead and mercury, particularly if it's been sourced from contaminated water. So that's a big concern," Ring says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A study &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666154325002017" target="_blank"&gt;published in June &lt;/a&gt;found that excessive or prolonged consumption of contaminated seaweed can lead to a buildup of heavy metals in the body, posing serious health risks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another concern: Sea moss is rich in iodine. We need some iodine for good thyroid health, but too much can potentially trigger thyroid dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ring says people with thyroid disorders or who are pregnant or breastfeeding should avoid sea moss. So should people on blood thinners, because sea moss contains vitamin K, which can interfere with these medications.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;If you want to try it&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One study found that powdered sea moss — the kind you might find in capsules — &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924796308002972" target="_blank"&gt;contained cadmium and lead at levels that exceeded&lt;/a&gt; limits set by California. That's why Ring says, if you do try sea moss, stick to it as a whole food or in gel form instead of supplements. Plus, you'll get more fiber this way, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;King notes that the Food and Drug Administration does not regulate supplements with the same rigor as pharmaceuticals. She notes that studies have found that supplements in general can contain way more of an ingredient than they say, so if you do choose to try a supplement, look for one tested by a third party to "make sure you're buying what you think you're buying."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you want to dip your toes into the sea moss trend, skip the supplements and try cooking with it instead, King suggests.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Or feel free to ignore the whole trend altogether, says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/diana-guevara-mph-rd/" target="_blank"&gt;Diana Guevara&lt;/a&gt;, a culinary registered dietician with the U.T. Health Houston School of Public Health. While sea moss can be healthy, she says it's no magic elixir.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You know, we want things to be easy and quick," Guevara says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But when it comes to good health she says, "it really is just that whole lifestyle of including more fruits, more vegetables, more whole grains and really just looking for that balance" in your diet."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It may not be trendiest advice, but it is backed by science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

There's a lot of hype on social media these days about how much protein you need and whether or not there's such thing as having too much in your diet. But is there really a magic number? And what does it mean for your meal prep?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt; “Protein is an important nutrient for your immune system, building structures like muscles, bones, and tendons, and also for keeping you full and satisfied throughout the day,” says dietitian Lindsay Malone, RD.

However, this is considered the bare minimum amount, and most people—especially avid exercisers and athletes—likely need more on a daily basis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Although it'd be nice to have a magic number, there is not an exact protein count that is “optimal” for all adult women, according to dietitian Kelly Jones, RD. But higher amounts of protein—closer to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26960445/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26960445/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="0.81 grams per pound" data-node-id="7.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;0.81 grams per pound&lt;/a&gt; of body weight—may be better to support long-term health outcomes, she says. Women who are breastfeeding in the early postpartum period tend to also require more than the RDA's recommended baseline, since protein can help support recovery and milk production, Jones adds. The same may be true for women who are going through perimenopause or &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a65280597/do-you-need-to-eat-more-protein-during-menopause/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a65280597/do-you-need-to-eat-more-protein-during-menopause/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="menopause" data-node-id="7.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;You may have heard that 1 gram of protein per pound is the optimal range for everyday consumption, but experts recommend talking to your provider first before implementing this rule. "One gram of protein may be recommended to athletes with goals to increase muscle mass—especially during times of a small calorie deficit—which may occur during certain heavy periods of training," Jones says. The "1 gram per pound" metric may also be recommended to help prevent muscle loss for athletes who are injured and are unable to exercise regularly, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But even for athletes with high energy and protein needs, it isn't recommended to consume more than 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight, Jones says. So, if you don't exercise a lot and are moderately active, it may be safer to stay slightly under that amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-calculate-your-protein-needs" data-node-id="11" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;How To Calculate Your Protein Needs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Your exact protein needs are ever-changing and correspond to your current weight, age, and health status, says dietitian Jenna Werner, RD, the founder of Happy Strong Healthy. If you're a true math nerd, you can calculate your minimum protein needs by multiplying your body weight in pounds by 0.36 or using this &lt;a href="https://www.nal.usda.gov/human-nutrition-and-food-safety/dri-calculator" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nal.usda.gov/human-nutrition-and-food-safety/dri-calculator" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="protein calculator" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;protein calculator&lt;/a&gt;. Keep in mind, though, that this is the &lt;em data-node-id="12.3"&gt;bare minimum &lt;/em&gt;recommendation—so if you're an athlete, work out a lot, or simply want to boost your intake, you may be better off multiplying your body weight by 0.81 grams.  &lt;em data-node-id="12.5"&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“Generally speaking, a great golden rule is to include a source of protein at every meal and snack you’re eating, and you should be in a good range,” says Brigitte Zeitlin, RD. For context, one hard-boiled egg is roughly six grams of protein, one chicken breast contains 28 grams of protein per three-ounce serving, an ounce of pistachios will fuel you up with six grams of protein, and ⅓ cup of hummus is equivalent to four grams of protein. These are just a handful of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/g28857774/healthy-high-protein-snacks/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/g28857774/healthy-high-protein-snacks/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="high-protein snacks" data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;high-protein snacks&lt;/a&gt; that can help you reach your quota. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Your diet should be unique to you, and the formula definitely isn't the end-all be-all. So, always check in with your physician about your individual needs—especially if you change your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a45014344/high-protein-meals-for-athletes/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a45014344/high-protein-meals-for-athletes/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="workout routine" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;workout routine&lt;/a&gt;, become pregnant, or experience other major health shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="best-sources-of-protein" data-node-id="16" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;Best Sources Of Protein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="body-text css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Once you’ve calculated your individual needs, dietitians recommend incorporating more &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/g44493323/high-protein-soup/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/g44493323/high-protein-soup/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="protein-packed foods" data-node-id="17.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;protein-packed foods&lt;/a&gt; into your daily meals. To get into a steady routine, start with breakfast, Zeitlin says. “Protein in the morning will actually keep you feeling more satiated and energized through your day,” she says. You can kick off your day with a spinach and cheese omelette, cottage cheese topped with almonds and blackberries, protein waffle mix, or even a scoop of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g44630683/best-protein-powders-for-women/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g44630683/best-protein-powders-for-women/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="protein powder" data-node-id="17.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;protein powder&lt;/a&gt; blended into a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/g36732247/breakfast-smoothies-for-weight-loss/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/g36732247/breakfast-smoothies-for-weight-loss/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="breakfast smoothie" data-node-id="17.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;breakfast smoothie&lt;/a&gt;.

Plant proteins are more nutrient-dense and lower your risk of chronic illnesses, Zeitlin says. Dairy items, meats, and even plant-based burgers and nuggets have high amounts of saturated fats, which are, by comparison, a greater risk factor for your health. For a balanced diet, enjoy two to six eggs a week, fish two to three times per week, keep red meat to one to two times per month, and fill in the rest with plant-based proteins and white meat chicken, Zeitlin recommends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="signs-of-too-much-protein" data-node-id="25" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;Signs Of Too Much Protein &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;A lack of protein in your diet can cause mood swings, low energy, focus problems, and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19992956/unexplained-weight-gain/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19992956/unexplained-weight-gain/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="weight gain" data-node-id="26.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;weight gain&lt;/a&gt;, but consuming &lt;em data-node-id="26.3"&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much protein can cause some unpleasant symptoms, especially when it comes to gastrointestinal issues, Zeitlin says. “Too much protein can contribute to constipation through slower digestion and delayed gastric emptying,” Malone adds. Excessive protein intake can also lead to long-term issues like an increased risk of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/g42407413/weird-heart-disease-risk-factors/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/g42407413/weird-heart-disease-risk-factors/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="heart disease" data-node-id="26.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, according to Zeitlin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Experts are divided on how much protein is "too much" numbers-wise—some say you definitely shouldn't exceed one gram of protein per pound, and others might recommend it. If you're concerned that you're overdoing it, always consult your physician first to find your ideal protein range. In the meantime, here are a few telltale signs and symptoms to watch out for that might indicate you’ve had too much protein, according to dietitian Kate Regan, RDN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But when will you start to notice the signs? “Some symptoms like indigestion may show up within the same day and others may take longer to surface," Regan says. Conditions like kidney stones and heart disease will likely take significantly longer time to develop over time, but to be safe, if you have concerning symptoms for more than 24 hours, call your doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“If you and your healthcare team have determined that you are consuming too much protein in your diet, you can gradually decrease protein intake while increasing your intake of the nutrients that protein has displaced such as carbohydrates, healthy fats, and fiber,” Regan says.

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This in-between state is a result of inflammation disrupting how RNA is spliced during the protein-making process, the researchers found, providing scientists with new treatment pathways to explore for the deadly disease. The researchers published their findings in the journal Nature Communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liver has a remarkable ability to regenerate itself after damage or partial removal. However, it loses that ability in patients with alcohol-associated liver disease -- the leading cause of liver-related mortality worldwide, resulting in roughly 3 million deaths annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We knew that the liver stops functioning and stops regenerating in patients with alcohol-related hepatitis and cirrhosis, even when a patient has discontinued consuming alcohol, but we didn't know why," said U. of I. biochemistry professor Auinash Kalsotra, who co-led the study with Duke University School of Medicine professor Anna Mae Diehl. "The only real life-saving treatment option once a patient reaches the liver failure stage in those diseases is transplantation. But if we understood why these livers were failing, maybe we could intervene."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the Kalsotra and Diehl labs havestudied the molecular and cellular underpinnings of liver regeneration. Over the last five years, they found that in order to regenerate, liver cells reprogram their gene expression to revert to fetal-like progenitor cells, multiply and then reverse the process back to become mature functioning cells again. Armed with this knowledge, the group turned to the question of how those mechanisms were disrupted in alcohol-associated liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared samples of healthy livers and samples of livers with alcohol-associated hepatitis or cirrhosis obtained from Johns Hopkins University Hospital through an initiative supported by the National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing the researchers noticed in diseased livers was that, although damaged cells had begun the process of reverting to the regenerative state, they did not complete the process and instead remained in transitional limbo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They are neither functional adult cells nor proliferative progenitor cells. Since they are not functioning, more pressure builds on the remaining cells. So they try to regenerate, and they're all ending up in this unproductive quasi-progenitor state, and that's what is causing liver failure," said U. of I. graduate students Ullas Chembazhi and Sushant Bangru, the co-first authors of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To figure out why the cells were getting stuck in this state, the team investigated which proteins were being made by the liver cells and, in turn, the RNA molecules carrying the instructions for those proteins from the DNA to the cell's protein-building machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most studies focus only on the total amounts of RNA or protein in a cell, Kalsotra's team used deep RNA sequencing technology and computational analyses to zoom in on the splicing of RNA fragments, a key step in stitching together different parts of genetic instructions to make proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In comparing the samples, we saw RNA was getting misspliced broadly in alcohol-related liver disease, across thousands of genes, and it was affecting major functions of proteins," said Kalsotra, who also is affiliated with the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology at Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found a possible driver of the RNA missplicing: Alcohol-damaged liver cells had a deficiency of the protein ESRP2, which binds to RNA to splice it properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Proteins function at a very specific place in the cell, and that is directed by sequences within the protein that take the protein to that particular spot. We found that, in many cases, the sequence that dictates where the protein localizes within a cell was misspliced. That's why it was important that we did the multiple analyses we did," said Kalsotra, also a member of the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Chicago. "There was the same amount of RNA and protein, but the protein was not at the right place to function. Due to missplicing, key proteins that are required for productive liver regeneration were getting stuck in the cytoplasm, when they needed to be in the nucleus."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To verify that ESRP2 deficiency was a likely culprit, the researchers studied mice without the gene that produces ESRP2. They displayed similar liver damage and regeneration failure to that seen in patients with advanced alcohol-related hepatitis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why was ESRP2 missing from liver cells from patients with alcohol-related hepatitis? Upon investigation, the researchers found that liver support cells and immune cells, drawn to the liver tissue damaged by alcohol processing, released high amounts of inflammatory and growth factors. Those factors suppress ESRP2 production and activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To verify this finding, the researchers treated liver cell cultures with a molecule that inhibits the receptor for one of the inflammation-promoting factors. ESRP2 levels recovered and splicing activity was corrected, pointing to the pathway as a possible treatment target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm hopeful these findings will become a launching pad for future clinical studies. We can use these misspliced RNAs as diagnostic markers or develop treatments that can curb the inflammation. And if we can correct the splicing defects, then maybe we can improve recovery and restore damaged livers," Kalsotra said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team also included U. of I. biochemistry graduate students Diptatanu Das and Subhashis Natua; U. of I. undergraduate students Katelyn Toohill, Ishita Purwar, and Anuprova Bhowmik; Brandon Peiffer and Zhaoli Sun from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine; Aurelia Leona and Yogesh Goyal from Northwestern University and Rajesh Dutta from Duke University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s not always what happens. And the reason is often financial: Federal regulators can fine hospitals hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars if too many of their patients get &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality/value-based-programs/hospital-acquired-conditions" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;hospital-acquired infections&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some hospital leaders, realizing that if they don’t look for infections, they won’t find them, are discouraging testing, clinicians told STAT. Without testing, patients may not get the best treatment. Executives have also pressured staffers in some cases not to report infections to the government, they said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s more, regulators have known about the problem for a decade, but neither Medicare nor Congress has taken action to fix it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is like health care’s dirty little secret,” said Carol McLay, president of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology. “Everybody knows it’s done. Nobody talks about it.”&lt;/p&gt;

While best estimates conclude that vaccines have saved more than 150 million lives in the past 50 years, the potential for their impact for future decades is increasingly threatened by another type of contagion: misinformation. Both misinformation and disinformation travel faster and further than truth. And their potential consequences include reversals of hard-won gains in vaccine coverage and disease control established over these decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="2015955141" paraeid="{8c1e7d5b-a6fa-4bf5-a810-ad44860b45ed}{149}"&gt;Vaccines have long been one of the most powerful tools in public health. They are arguably the most cost-effective public health intervention available. They save more than five lives every minute, protect against severe disease and disability, reduce the burden on health systems, protect families from sinking into extreme poverty, and contribute to economic growth. Thanks to global vaccination efforts, over 18 million people who would have been paralysed by polio can walk today, over 90 million children who would have died from measles are alive, and more than a million deaths now and in the years to come from cervical cancer have already been averted. Tens of millions more who would have suffered severe disease, some with lifelong disabilities, from meningitis, pneumonia, whooping cough, congenital rubella, rotavirus diarrhea, diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, and more, have never suffered those fates. And yet, we are risking the erosion of decades of progress—not because we lack safe and effective vaccines, nor because of a lack of innovation or commitment to vaccines, but because of misinformation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="571332825" paraeid="{8c1e7d5b-a6fa-4bf5-a810-ad44860b45ed}{229}"&gt;The consequences of vaccine misinformation are not hypothetical—they are real and tragic. There have been several recent cases of healthy children who died after contracting the highly contagious measles virus, or from complications of measles that can emerge years after recovery from a measles infection. Childhood vaccination rates in some countries that had previously had very high rates are dropping to levels not seen in many years. These national figures hide the fact that coverage in some communities is substantially below even the national average and far below the 95% threshold needed to maintain herd immunity. This drop in coverage, particularly for the measles vaccine, is driving a significant rise in measles cases and deaths, including in wealthy countries like the US, Canada, the UK and other European countries.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1670077176" paraeid="{8bc2abf9-3360-4140-b96c-75c9cd51e4ee}{40}"&gt;In 2024, 14.5 million infants worldwide missed out on getting even a single dose of vaccine in the essential immunization programme, according to the&lt;a href="/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/immunization-analysis-and-insights/global-monitoring/immunization-coverage/who-unicef-estimates-of-national-immunization-coverage" target="_blank"&gt; latest WHO-UNICEF estimates&lt;/a&gt;. These are “zero-dose” children—many living in fragile settings where access to care is limited and misinformation contributes an added threat.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1266049462" paraeid="{8bc2abf9-3360-4140-b96c-75c9cd51e4ee}{62}"&gt;The tactics of anti-vaccine narratives are disturbingly familiar: they often promote conspiracies that portray governments, scientists, or pharmaceutical companies as corrupt; rely on spokespeople who claim to have expertise, who discredit legitimate science; cite cherry-picked studies that ignore the overwhelming majority of scientific evidence and consensus; misrepresent safety data especially from passive surveillance systems; set impossible targets that vaccines be 100% effective and have no risks no matter how rare; and use misrepresentations or flawed analogies designed to provoke emotional reactions rather than informed understanding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="875718345" paraeid="{8bc2abf9-3360-4140-b96c-75c9cd51e4ee}{96}"&gt;While fact-checking and scientific evidence matter, research shows that once people are exposed to falsehoods, they often continue to rely on them—even after being shown the facts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="761598995" paraeid="{8bc2abf9-3360-4140-b96c-75c9cd51e4ee}{108}"&gt;This is an issue of influence, not of ignorance. Misinformation is increasingly driven from the top, with prominent influencers pushing thoroughly debunked myths, such as the disproven and false claim that the MMR vaccine causes autism. Pseudoscience, false logic, and selective "evidence" are weaponized in ways that sow confusion and doubt among well-meaning parents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1504988770" paraeid="{8bc2abf9-3360-4140-b96c-75c9cd51e4ee}{122}"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAGE: Strengthening science  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="612096383" paraeid="{8bc2abf9-3360-4140-b96c-75c9cd51e4ee}{132}"&gt;At WHO, the &lt;a href="/groups/strategic-advisory-group-of-experts-on-immunization" target="_blank"&gt;Strategic Advisory Group of Experts&lt;/a&gt; (SAGE) plays a pivotal role in ensuring that vaccination policies are grounded in the best available evidence. SAGE uses the Evidence to Recommendations (ETR) approach, which transparently specifies how evidence on efficacy, safety, cost-effectiveness, burden of disease, programmatic feasibility, acceptability, and other elements contributed to policy recommendations. In its upcoming September meeting, SAGE will provide guidance on immunization in emergencies and fragile settings, new vaccine introductions, addressing zero-dose children and equity gaps, and monitoring adverse events while reinforcing vaccine safety systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="823657453" paraeid="{8bc2abf9-3360-4140-b96c-75c9cd51e4ee}{156}"&gt;These recommendations are essential inputs for national governments navigating complex decisions amid rising skepticism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="22769318" paraeid="{8bc2abf9-3360-4140-b96c-75c9cd51e4ee}{166}"&gt;In an era where public discourse is fragmented and science is increasingly politicized, bodies like SAGE are guardians of scientific integrity. Their role is more vital than ever—not only to guide policy but to reinforce public confidence in the institutions whose job it is to protect and promote health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1139770062" paraeid="{8bc2abf9-3360-4140-b96c-75c9cd51e4ee}{184}"&gt;How do we respond to the emerging challenges of today? Any action must be rooted in listening to public concerns, and family concerns.  It must actively counter disinformation at its source, which includes collaborating with social scientists to understand the complex dynamics that fuel hesitancy and other causes of low uptake. Transparency, especially in moments of uncertainty, is more essential than ever. We must support all programme stakeholders to share accurate information about vaccination: health professionals, local advocates and champions, and other partners such as teachers, journalists, and youth leaders.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1090042125" paraeid="{8bc2abf9-3360-4140-b96c-75c9cd51e4ee}{236}"&gt;Our collective responsibility is clear: to protect evidence-based decisions as fiercely as we protect lives.

One, for example, is sometimes given to those who have already been infected by dengue before, to protect against future infection. Another is not particularly effective in some younger children, but recommended for older ones.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, one promising solution could dramatically reduce the spread of infections and the number of people experiencing a severe form of the disease: the Wolbachia method.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wolbachia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; is a tiny bacterium that naturally occurs in around half of all insect species, including fruit flies, bees, beetles, moths, dragonflies, butterflies, and some mosquitoes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-block__pull-quote--right span-cols-14 grid grid-cols-12-full-width"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="right"&gt;“Far North Queensland is now essentially a dengue-free area for the first time in well over 100 years”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The mosquito most commonly spreading dengue fever — &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; — &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;doesn’t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; naturally contain Wolbachia. But scientists discovered that when these mosquitoes are bred to carry it, they are much less likely to transmit viruses from person to person. This doesn’t just apply to dengue fever but also to other diseases such as yellow fever, Zika, and chikungunya. This new method promises to finally give humanity an effective tool against several tropical neglected diseases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this article, I’ll focus on how Wolbachia can be used against dengue fever. I'll examine how this innovative new method works, how effective it is in reducing transmission, and how it can be rolled out across the tropics to protect as many people as possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 class="h1-semibold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="how-the-wolbachia-method-works"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How the Wolbachia method works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#how-the-wolbachia-method-works"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;To understand how Wolbachia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;could stop the spread of disease, we must first understand how mosquitoes transmit them. Mosquitoes do not carry these tropical diseases naturally. Instead, female mosquitoes can pick up the virus when they bite someone already infected with dengue fever, yellow fever, or Zika. When they then bite their next victim, they can pass it on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The spread is from human to human, but mosquitoes act as the messenger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Wolbachia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;works because it stops the viral infection from developing in the mosquito. It boosts its immune system, and since mosquitoes need resources to survive, it reduces the available resources (such as cholesterol) that viruses need to grow. Wolbachia makes it much harder for viruses to thrive, and if they’re not present in the mosquito, they can’t be passed on to the next human.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But how do scientists &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.worldmosquitoprogram.org/en/work/wolbachia-method/how-it-works" class="span-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;develop a whole population&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of Wolbachia-positive mosquitoes?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;First, they extract Wolbachia bacteria from insects that naturally carry them. Around half of insects do, so we’re never in short supply. Then, under a microscope, they inject these bacteria into &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; embryos. This is an incredibly delicate process that requires very fine needles and lots of expertise. Even then, many of the embryos don’t survive. Those that do, though, are raised into adult mosquitoes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The second step is to develop a colony of Wolbachia-positive mosquitoes in the lab. This is done by taking the females with Wolbachia and having them mate with male mosquitoes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wolbachia is passed on not only to males but also to mosquito offspring that the females produce.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once a big enough population of Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes has been established, they’re released into the wild, where they mix with natural populations. This part of the process can require large teams of volunteers. In their lifetimes, mosquitoes usually don’t fly more than 150 meters from where they hatch, so you need many spaced releases to cover an area that’s even just a few tens of square kilometers. Over several generations — typically within three to six months — more and more mosquitoes within the local environment become “Wolbachia-positive” until almost all of the mosquitoes carry the bacteria. That means they do not carry or transmit viruses like dengue fever to humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the chart below, I summarized this process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="body-3-medium-italic article-block__aside article-block__aside--right col-start-11 span-cols-3 span-md-cols-10 col-md-start-3 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I’ll come on to later, these wild releases require many mosquitoes. There are now “factories” for this; one in Medellín, Colombia, produces 30 million Wolbachia-positive mosquitoes weekly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;figure class="article-block__image article-block__image--narrow col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 col-sm-start-2 span-sm-cols-12"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This method tends to be self-sustaining, so once a successful “release” of mosquitoes has occurred, it doesn’t need to be repeated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The method does not involve genetic modification of mosquito species; it simply relies on a natural bacterium that’s extremely common among insects and many other mosquito species. Humans are exposed to these bacteria daily through the food they eat and the insects that bite them. There have been no reported health risks associated with exposure to it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 class="h1-semibold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="wolbachia-programs-reduce-the-number-of-dengue-infections-by-more-than-three-quarters"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wolbachia programs reduce the number of dengue infections by more than three-quarters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#wolbachia-programs-reduce-the-number-of-dengue-infections-by-more-than-three-quarters"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many things should work in theory; the question is whether they also work in practice. How about the Wolbachia method?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.worldmosquitoprogram.org/sites/default/files/2023-02/RCT%202021-WMP%20Indo-factsheet.pdf" class="span-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;most famous trials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; was conducted by the World Mosquito Program in Yogyakarta, a city in Indonesia that is badly affected by dengue fever and other neglected tropical diseases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-2" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Working with the local community — a population of around 310,000 people — the study site was split into 24 areas, each measuring around one square kilometer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="body-3-medium-italic article-block__aside article-block__aside--right col-start-11 span-cols-3 span-md-cols-10 col-md-start-3 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This was the method's first randomized control trial (RCT). RCTs are often considered the “gold standard” for testing the efficacy of particular interventions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="article-block__pull-quote--left-center col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="left-center"&gt;Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes reduced dengue fever infections by 77% and hospitalizations by 86% in Indonesian trials&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Twelve of those areas were randomly selected to have Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes released. The other 12 did not get the Wolbachia treatment (and were therefore the “control”). By comparing dengue fever infections in the areas that did and didn’t receive Wolbachia, researchers could learn how effective it was in stopping the spread. Note that this involved releases of the mosquitoes every few weeks over nine months, so it wasn’t a single “one-time” release.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The results are staggering. Wolbachia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;reduced dengue fever's incidence (the number of new infections) by 77%, and the number of dengue hospitalizations was 86% lower in the areas with Wolbachia treatment. The figure below summarizes these results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article-block__image article-block__image--wide col-start-4 span-cols-8 col-md-start-2 span-md-cols-12"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We can also see this effect when comparing dengue fever infection rates over time. In the chart below, we can see dengue fever cases in areas that received the Wolbachia treatment as the solid red line and those that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;didn’t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; get the treatment as the blue line. In the period before the Wolbachia release in 2016, all of these areas experienced large outbreaks at similar times. But after the deployment of Wolbachia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;(the shaded zone at the end), the areas with the treatment had significantly lower levels than those without. That suggests that it was effective in reducing the spread of the virus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But as you can see in the chart, even in areas with the Wolbachia treatment, the number of dengue fever infections didn’t drop to zero. That’s why combining it with other control methods, such as effective vaccines, sprays, and bednets, might still be needed to ensure everyone is protected. These other interventions would be required at a much lower scale than in a scenario without any Wolbachia treatment, and the results would be far better than what could be achieved with sprays or nets alone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article-block__image article-block__image--wide col-start-4 span-cols-8 col-md-start-2 span-md-cols-12"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Indonesia is not the only country where we have evidence that this method works.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first Wolbachia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;releases by the World Mosquito Program were in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.worldmosquitoprogram.org/en/global-progress/australia" class="span-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Northern Queensland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Australia, back in 2011. Over the last 14 years, monitoring has shown that Wolbachia-positive mosquitoes continue to self-sustain. There are no signs of local dengue transmission in the areas with the highest rollout. As Dr Richard Gair, a physician in the local area, put it:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="article-block__blockquote col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Far North Queensland is now essentially a dengue-free area for the first time in well over 100 years.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Programs in Brazil and Colombia reduced new dengue infections by more than two-thirds, and in some cases, more than 90% in the areas where they were released. In Brazil, the same method also led to a substantial decline in the incidence of the Zika virus and chikungunya.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-3" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 class="h1-semibold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="how-can-wolbachia-programs-be-scaled-across-the-tropics"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How can Wolbachia programs be scaled across the tropics?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#how-can-wolbachia-programs-be-scaled-across-the-tropics"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;These results seem too good to be true. The Wolbachia method has been shown to dramatically reduce the spread of not just dengue fever but also other neglected diseases. Wolbachia is self-sustaining, unlike other management tools such as vaccines, mosquito sprays, or bednets, which must be readministered or delivered periodically. Once Wolbachia-positive mosquito populations have been established, they remain so for long periods. There are no obvious biodiversity concerns, and this method does not involve genetic modification (which often receives public and political pushback and involves additional regulatory hurdles).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What’s stopping them from being scaled across much of the tropics, where tens of millions of people are affected by these diseases every year?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first potential barrier is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;public and political acceptance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;. In each trial program, researchers invested heavily in community engagement through local media and key stakeholders to explain to the local population what was involved, how it worked, and the impacts. People could share their concerns and have their questions answered. This was particularly successful in building community trust, and support for the trials was high. In Yogyakarta, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.worldmosquitoprogram.org/sites/default/files/2023-08/AUG2023%20WMP%20Indo%20factsheet.pdf" class="span-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;public acceptance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; was at 88%, and in other parts of Indonesia where interventions took place, this was over 90%. In Colombia, Australia, and Brazil, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.worldmosquitoprogram.org/en/learn/fact-sheets" class="span-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;levels of support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; were similarly high.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;These trials were clearly carefully planned and small enough to develop public trust. This might be harder if they were to be rolled out across much larger areas. However, the difficulty in building confidence in these initial trials is that these Wolbachia programs were extremely new and experimental to some extent. As Wolbachia became more common and the benefits were more widely known, the amount of engagement needed to help locals understand the costs and benefits would fall. I expect this will not be a blocker, and will be more welcome to many than alternative health measures such as vaccines or chemical sprays.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The challenge of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;funding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; these programs is a bigger barrier. Most initial programs have been financed through institutional grants or philanthropic donations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-4" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; These financial commitments are viable at the trial stage, but generous donations will not be sufficient to scale these programs across the tropics. Other forms of finance — most likely government funding in each country — will be needed for this next stage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Wolbachia method requires a substantial &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;upfront&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; cost to breed or buy mosquitoes and develop labor-intensive release programs. But the “running” costs are very low once they've been deployed. Only a few studies are looking at the cost-effectiveness of Wolbachia, but early evidence suggests a payback of $1.35 to $3.40 for every dollar spent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-5" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; A study looking at the cost-effectiveness of Wolbachia programs in a densely-populated city in Indonesia estimated that it cost around $1500 to prevent one disability-adjusted life year (DALY), a measure of disease burden. By global health standards, that is relatively cheap, especially in middle-income countries where many incredibly cheap life-saving interventions, such as childhood vaccinations, are already widely used. So these programs — particularly in areas with a lot of dengue fever — should pay themselves back and be a good investment for most governments, but that doesn’t mean securing the capital costs is easy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-block__pull-quote--right-center col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="right-center"&gt;Scaling Wolbachia programs means producing billions of mosquitoes weekly — Medellín already makes 30 million every week&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The most obvious barriers to me are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;logistical challenges &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;needed to apply this method at scale. Extracting the bacteria from other insects and microinjecting them into tiny mosquito embryos is incredibly labour-intensive and requires rare skills and dexterity. However, a mass breeding program must be developed in much larger volumes. This means that applying this method in large, densely populated regions is a much bigger task than in many of the trials we looked at above. Colombia &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;has&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; invested in giant mosquito-breeding programs, and the size is quite astounding: its Medellín factory produces more than &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/mosquito-factory" class="span-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;30 million mosquitoes every week&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. If we expand Wolbachia across high-impact tropical areas, we’d need to scale this to billions of mosquitoes weekly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the future, countries would either have to develop their own mosquito-breeding factories or import mosquito eggs internationally, which also introduces challenges around preservation, risks of infection, and biosafety concerns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The last logistical hurdle is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;distribution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;. In the trials, mosquitoes were released every 50 meters. They therefore relied on a large number of program staff and community volunteers. Scaling this across large cities efficiently and sustainably is a challenge. There is an opportunity for emerging technologies, such as drones, to make this process less labor-intensive and more optimized, but these solutions are still &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.worldmosquitoprogram.org/en/learn/scientific-publications/field-deployment-wolbachia-infected-aedes-aegypti-using-uncrewed" class="span-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;at the trial stage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Wolbachia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;method is an extremely promising solution that could protect hundreds of millions of people from some of the world’s most neglected diseases, which currently have no cure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-block__callout col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;h4 class="callout-heading"&gt;Acknowledgments&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thanks to Max Roser, Edouard Mathieu, and Simon van Teutem for their feedback and comments on this article and its visualizations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-block__recirc--center col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2 recirc recirc--center"&gt;&lt;span class="recirc__heading body-3-bold"&gt;Continue reading on Our World in Data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section id="article-citation" class="grid grid-cols-12-full-width col-start-1 col-end-limit"&gt;&lt;div class="col-start-4 span-cols-8 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 col-sm-start-2 span-sm-cols-12"&gt;&lt;h3 class="align-center"&gt;Cite this work&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our articles and data visualizations rely on work from many different people and organizations.

If the body isn't allowed to rest properly, the repercussions spread far beyond fatigue or crankiness. Chronic lack of sleep, specifically sleeping less than seven hours a night, is now being linked with life-and-death diseases such as cancer and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sleep and the body's repair system&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;During deep sleep, your body does cell repair, hormone balancing, and immune protection. When this is disrupted, cells may accumulate damage, inflammation rises, and the immune system can no longer recognize and destroy diseased cells. This compromised repair mechanism is only one of the reasons scientists have associated brief sleep with increased cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such study published in the Cardiology reviews in the National Institutes of Health says that sleep deprivation is a growing public health concer, and reduction in sleep is now strongly linked to hypertension, coronary heart disease and diabetes mellitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Fix Your Sleep Naturally!

This study focused on U-shaped relationship between sleep duration and mortality, meaning too little or too much both can increase the risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study concluded that people who slept less than 6-7 hours can significantly be under the radar of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart diseases&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diabetes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cancer and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Early mortality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The cancer connection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have found that too little sleep alters melatonin production. Melatonin is not just a sleep hormone but also a strong antioxidant that suppresses tumor growth. Its deficiency can accelerate mutations in cells and compromise the body's natural protection against cancerous alterations. Epidemiological studies have been able to recognize higher rates of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers among individuals who typically sleep less than seven hours. Shift workers, thanks to the constant disruption of their sleep cycles, are particularly vulnerable, but another association between cancer growth and sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One study &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.34951#xd_co_f=MWU1ODA2OTQtZDNiZi00OTQwLThmMzktNWFkODI2Mzk2ZTc1~" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, analysed data from over 14,800 people aged 45+ and followed them for a median of 6.9 years.

This stresses arteries, increases inflammation, and accelerates plaque build-up. Ultimately, all these result in an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. Poor sleep also interferes with glucose metabolism and raises stress hormones like cortisol, which trigger a cascade of effects that compromise the heart and vascular system.

Lack of sleep doubles the inflammatory chemicals in the body, giving fertile ground for disease progression. If the colon, arteries, and immune system are put under constant pressure by the inflammatory axis, chances of genetic injury, blockage of arteries, and organ failure increase tenfold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Building better sleep habits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that sleep health is in your hands. Sleeping seven to nine hours per night of good quality sleep is one of the most effective forms of prevention. Making minor changes such as being in bed at the same time, not drinking caffeine after noon, being in a dark and cold sleeping environment, and reducing screen time before bedtime can significantly improve the quality of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is not lost time, it is the first line of defense of your body against disease. By skipping it, you unknowingly expose yourself to cancer and heart disease that otherwise could have been prevented.

But the uncomfortable truth about &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/increase-health-benefits-of-walking-b2774984.html" title="Four science-backed ways to make your daily walk even better for your health"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; is that, to prompt positive physical changes, you usually have to do more of it, or at least progress it in some way – &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/fitness-myths-weight-loss-calorie-deficit-b2823264.html" title="From exercising for fat loss to building muscle in a calorie deficit – doctor of sport science corrects three fitness myths"&gt;running further&lt;/a&gt; or lifting &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/weightlifting-muscle-hypertrophy-dumbbell-b2819419.html" title="I have a PhD in strength training – stop using the wrong weights for your workouts with this simple test"&gt;heavier weights&lt;/a&gt; for more sets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This requires time, which is something most people are in short supply of. But there are ways to achieve more in your workouts while taking a smaller chunk of your day – particularly when it comes to &lt;a href="/topic/strength-training"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People assume that when you’re working out you need to spend hours and hours in the gym to get benefits,” says &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://wolfcoaching.com/about"&gt;Dr Milo Wolf&lt;/a&gt;, a fitness coach and founder of training app &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://myoadapt.com/"&gt;MyoAdapt&lt;/a&gt;, who holds a PhD in sport science specialising in strength training. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In reality, you don’t need to spend that much time in the gym to start seeing results. If you employ certain strategies, you can get away with as little as 30-60 minutes in the gym each week and still see really solid progress, even if you’ve been lifting for several years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, he explains the theory behind six of these strategies, and shares a two workouts per week plan you can follow with just a few dumbbells to develop strength, boost bone density, build muscle, improve mobility and experience the plethora of other benefits strength training has to offer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Technique one: Maximise the efficacy of each set &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strength training is a victim of diminishing returns, so performing more sets of an exercise in a bid to build more muscle will not necessarily be the smartest move for efficiency or overall results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Let’s say you do five to 10 sets per week on each muscle group – you’re going to get a solid amount of your potential muscle growth and results from the gym,” Wolf says. “But when you go from five to 10 sets per week for each muscle group to 20, 30 or more, that’s where the benefits really start to taper off. You’re getting less bang for your buck.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, he recommends focusing on a few heavy sets per week on each muscle group, and trying to make them as effective as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To make these sets as effective as possible, you want to take those sets close to failure [where your muscles have tired to the point you cannot perform another rep with good form],” says Wolf. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good signifier of reaching this stage is that your movements should involuntarily slow down during the last few reps of a set as a result of muscular fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How close to failure you should go is still a topic of ongoing research,” Wolf adds. “From my reading of the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38970765/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, if you only do a few sets per week on each muscle group, you probably want to take them at least to failure, and potentially even past failure.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can be done through techniques such as drop sets, which he explains in one of the sections below. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Across dozens of studies, we see that the closer you go to failure overall, the more muscle growth you see,” Wolf adds. “Because training to failure doesn’t take any additional time, it is one of the strategies you can employ to grow muscle more efficiently.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/weightlifting-muscle-hypertrophy-dumbbell-b2819419.html"&gt;I have a PhD in strength training – stop using the wrong weights for your workouts with this simple test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="8" class="sc-awdjp1-0 hIWccK"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/01/9/18/Strength-training-offers-long-lasting-benefits-which-can-protect-your-health-and-functionality-for-y.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/01/9/18/Strength-training-offers-long-lasting-benefits-which-can-protect-your-health-and-functionality-for-y.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/01/9/18/Strength-training-offers-long-lasting-benefits-which-can-protect-your-health-and-functionality-for-y.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Taking each set close to failure has been linked with greater muscle growth." class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-210888"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Taking each set close to failure has been linked with greater muscle growth.&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Technique two: Antagonistic supersets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The two techniques we have the most research on for saving time and still getting the same amount of muscle growth are drop sets and &lt;a rel="nofollow" data-affiliate="true" target="_blank" href="http://redirect.viglink.com?u=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs42978-020-00092-z&amp;amp;articleId=b2827434&amp;amp;key=5b1a6400a3c0d931ed2037885e1a27a3"&gt;antagonistic supersets&lt;/a&gt;,” says Wolf. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has co-authored a paper on this topic, with the take-home message being that they can deliver similar levels of muscle growth in approximately half the time of a traditional strength training set-up – ie performing a set, resting for 60-plus seconds, then performing another set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what is an antagonistic superset, and how can it streamline your strength training efforts? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most muscles exist in antagonistic pairs. This simply means the muscles in this pairing contract and relax to deliver opposing functions – for example, the biceps contract to flex the elbow and bend your arm, then the biceps muscles relax and the triceps contract to extend it again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An antagonistic superset involves working these muscles back to back with no rest in between. After you have completed both exercises, you take a break before repeating the sequence, thus cutting out half of the usual rest intervals you would have during your strength training session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Effectively, while one muscle is resting, the other one is training,” explains Wolf. “Because a biceps curl targets the biceps on the front of your arm, then a triceps extension targets the triceps on the back of your arm, performing the opposite joint function, they are not going to overlap.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further examples of antagonistic supersets could be a chest exercise like the press-up and a back exercise like the bent-over row, or a quadriceps-dominant exercise like the &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/how-to-squat-correctly-b2606171.html"&gt;squat&lt;/a&gt; and a hamstring-dominant exercise like the Romanian &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/how-to-deadlift-correctly-b2603126.html"&gt;deadlift&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You don’t need to pick two exercises that target antagonistic or opposite muscles either,” adds Wolf. “You can also superset any two exercises that don’t have any meaningful overlap. Something like a calf raise and a lateral raise [for the shoulders], for example.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/best-healthy-habits-every-day-b2806102.html"&gt;Do these five things daily for 90 days to see a ‘profound difference’ in your health, fitness and energy levels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="8" class="sc-awdjp1-0 WYhPC"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/17/11/39/Regular-strength-training-offers-impressive-bang-for-your-buck-particularly-for-beginners-says-exper.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/17/11/39/Regular-strength-training-offers-impressive-bang-for-your-buck-particularly-for-beginners-says-exper.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/17/11/39/Regular-strength-training-offers-impressive-bang-for-your-buck-particularly-for-beginners-says-exper.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Performing supersets – two exercises performed back to back with no rest in between – can cut down the number of rest intervals needed in your workout, reducing the overall time it takes." class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-210889"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Performing supersets – two exercises performed back to back with no rest in between – can cut down the number of rest intervals needed in your workout, reducing the overall time it takes.&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Technique three: Drop sets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have around six to 10 studies now comparing drop sets with traditional strength training,” Wolf says. “In these studies, we see that drop set training leads to the same muscle growth [as traditional strength training] in 30-70 per cent less time, depending on the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://journal.iusca.org/index.php/Journal/article/view/135"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;. So if you were previously working out for an hour-and-a-half, you could be looking at spending more like half an hour in the gym instead and still seeing the same results – which is great.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, as with the antagonistic supersets above, it’s important to understand what a drop set is, and how you can use them to build muscle more efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With drop set training, you start with a heavy set to failure, then immediately after finishing this, you drop the weight you’re lifting by roughly 20 per cent and complete another set to failure with this new, lighter weight,” Wolf explains. “Straight after this second set, drop the weight by about 20 per cent again and complete another set to failure. Continue this until you have completed your target number of sets.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first set will usually have a target number of repetitions to aim for – usually between eight and 12 – then for the subsequent sets, your goal is to perform as many reps as you can with good technique. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Different people might get different numbers of reps on the drop sets because of their physiology,” Wolf explains. “Some people might be able to hit 10 reps on that second set, while others may only manage six. To prescribe a set number of reps is probably doing a disservice to how unique each person is.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://journal.iusca.org/index.php/Journal/article/view/135"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that, for every one normal set you would usually do, you should typically do 1.6 drop sets to see similar results, he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, this means if you would usually do three sets of 10 on an exercise, you could swap this for a drop set with five subsequent lighter sets in quick succession – a taxing but far more time-savvy procedure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/gut-health-nutrition-diet-b2789919.html"&gt;Eat these two foods weekly to improve gut health and reduce tummy troubles, nutrition expert says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="8" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dzgyhB"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/03/16/07/Dr-Milo-Wolf-says-many-people-particularly-beginners-underestimate-their-abilities-in-the-gym-and-co.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/03/16/07/Dr-Milo-Wolf-says-many-people-particularly-beginners-underestimate-their-abilities-in-the-gym-and-co.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/03/16/07/Dr-Milo-Wolf-says-many-people-particularly-beginners-underestimate-their-abilities-in-the-gym-and-co.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Dr Milo Wolf says drop sets – performing a set of an exercise to failure, then reducing the weight you are lifting and performing another max-effort set – is another way to train more efficiently." class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-210890"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Dr Milo Wolf says drop sets – performing a set of an exercise to failure, then reducing the weight you are lifting and performing another max-effort set – is another way to train more efficiently.&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Technique four: Exercise selection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might seem obvious, but it is a point that is often overlooked. Choosing exercises that require less prep work will save you time in the gym. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, rather than biding your time for a turn on the bench press, could you hit your chest with a few hard sets of press-ups? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dumbbell exercises are going to be more efficient than the barbell alternatives,” Wolf says. “With a barbell, you need to warm up, load the plates, then unload them and put them away afterwards. While that might not seem like much, that’s a few minutes you could spend doing an extra one or two sets of a dumbbell exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The same applies for stack-loaded machines and bodyweight movements, as long as the resistance is sufficient to get a solid stimulus [ie you can take each set close to failure].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/longevity-ageing-exercise-personal-trainer-b2779460.html"&gt;I’m a trainer specialising in longevity – these are the five changes that have the biggest impact on my clients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="8" class="sc-awdjp1-0 cdhirR"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/08/20/10/newFile-4.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/08/20/10/newFile-4.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/08/20/10/newFile-4.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Replacing a barbell exercise with a dumbbell exercise targetting the same muscles can save you from having to load and unload the bar, granting you a few extra minutes to squeeze in some valuable additional sets of other exercises." class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-210891"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Replacing a barbell exercise with a dumbbell exercise targetting the same muscles can save you from having to load and unload the bar, granting you a few extra minutes to squeeze in some valuable additional sets of other exercises.&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Technique five: Do a no-frills warm-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people spend a lot of time on their warm-up, which is an honourable endeavour – no one wants to pick up an injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But recent &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://sportrxiv.org/index.php/server/preprint/view/559"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; trumpets the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/75109"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://sportrxiv.org/index.php/server/preprint/view/559"&gt;mental merits&lt;/a&gt; of a shorter warm-up. This is particularly true in a controlled environment like a gym, where injury risk is relatively very low when compared to the dynamism and unpredictability of field sports such as football. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you want to save time, warming up should be kept to the bare bones,” says Wolf. “Warm-ups can be important, especially for sports, but for lifting, there are a few points to take note of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Firstly, the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1360859224004017#bib3"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; we have suggests just one fairly heavy set [between 70-90 per cent of your one-rep max] of one to three reps, before your first actual training set, tends to be all you need to elicit a boost in performance. It’s heavy, but it’s a very feasible set, and it should make your first training set feel a lot more manageable. If you’re already walking or cycling to the gym, that one fairly heavy set might be enough to cover your warm-up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolf also points out that any time spent warming up is time not spent on your actual workout. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you go to the gym for 60 minutes and spend 20 minutes warming up, that is 40 minutes where you are not working hard,” he says. “If your warm-up takes five minutes, you have 55 minutes of actual working out, and so you’re likely to see more health benefits, muscle growth and overall progress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, when training with sub-maximal loads and a primary goal of building muscle, Wolf likes to keep his warm-ups to just a few minutes. He has found a set of six to 10 reps of the exercise he is going to be doing, at 40 per cent of his one-rep max, followed by a set of one to three reps at 70-80 per cent of his one-rep max, works well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/fitness-tips-weight-loss-b2810890.html"&gt;If you struggle to stay fit, try adding these nine simple science-backed behaviours into your week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="8" class="sc-awdjp1-0 ezwNXu"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/04/24/10/woman-exercising-in-gym.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/04/24/10/woman-exercising-in-gym.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/04/24/10/woman-exercising-in-gym.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="For strength training sessions, Wolf says warm-ups can usually be kept to five minutes." class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-210892"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;For strength training sessions, Wolf says warm-ups can usually be kept to five minutes.&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Technique six: Workout frequency&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important factor in finding an effective workout routine is identifying one that suits your schedule – the workouts you do are always going to deliver greater results than the workouts you miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for those trying to maximise their training efficiency, Wolf says two to three weekly full-body workouts hits the sweet spot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://sportrxiv.org/index.php/server/preprint/view/460"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, we generally see that training a muscle twice a week is a bit better than training it once a week,” he explains. “So, doing one hour-long workout might be slightly worse than doing two 20-30-minute workouts. For this reason, I would suggest adopting a full-body routine where every major muscle group gets hit at least twice per week, and I would focus heavily on compound movements – exercises that target multiple muscles at once.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each workout, Wolf recommends including exercises covering four movement patterns which, between them, “cover most bases”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are the hip hinge for the lower body, so things like deadlifts, Romanian deadlifts and even hip thrusts,” he says. “The other important movement pattern for the lower body is some sort of squat or lunge pattern, so we’re talking about a high bar squat, Bulgarian split squat or dumbbell step-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Then there’s a horizontal press, training your chest, triceps, front deltoids and even your lateral deltoids with things like the dumbbell chest press, dips and deficit press-ups. And the final movement pattern to include is going to be a horizontal pull. The reason a horizontal pull is so important is because it gets a good amount of stimulus to the latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, mid trapezius and lower trapezius [the muscles across your back].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So if I was constructing two or three full-body workouts per week and I wanted maximum bang for your buck in terms of bone health, overall resilience, better functionality in day-to-day life and muscle growth, I would just focus on getting those four movement patterns in and doing two or three sets of each per workout.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/fitness-myths-weight-loss-calorie-deficit-b2823264.html"&gt;From exercising for fat loss to building muscle in a calorie deficit – doctor of sport science corrects three fitness myths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="8" class="sc-awdjp1-0 djHxeM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/03/07/11/iStock-700614430.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/03/07/11/iStock-700614430.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/03/07/11/iStock-700614430.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Two to three weekly full-body workotus, twinned with walking 8,000 to 12,000 steps per day, will offer ‘the vast majority of benefits from exercise’, according to Wolf" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-210893"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Two to three weekly full-body workotus, twinned with walking 8,000 to 12,000 steps per day, will offer ‘the vast majority of benefits from exercise’, according to Wolf&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dr Milo Wolf’s two-day workout plan for busy people &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wypyku-0 sc-wn0aau-0 lnUWhb kfwxdp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two workouts below should take roughly 20 minutes each, and they are to be performed on different days of the week. When arranging them in your week, leave at least one full day between the two workouts. Beyond this, you can be flexible as to how and when you incorporate them into your routine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each workout comprises four exercises, to be performed as two supersets – paired movements are signified by the labels A and B. In practice, this means you will start the first workout by performing five to eight repetitions of the flat dumbbell press, immediately followed by five to eight repetitions of the incline dumbbell row. After this, you rest for 45 seconds then repeat this sequence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you have completed this sequence three times, you move on to the second set of exercises. All movements have been demonstrated in the video above. You can also find a video of a beginner workout which follows the same base principles underneath the tables below. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Day one&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-lq6hxg-0 kcbSyT"&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1A.

So, in contrast to things like getting your steps in or activities like running and cycling, where you generally see more health benefits the more you do, it seems like you can get most, if not all, the health benefits of lifting weights from around two hours per week.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, the term health encompasses myriad metrics including a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer and all-cause mortality. In Wolf’s words: “Strength training lowers your risk of basically every conceivable disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most forms of activity do a similarly effective job, provided you do them consistently, at improving your health,” he continues. “But there are going to be slight additional benefits to lifting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, lifting weights has a relatively low injury rate when compared to high-impact activities like running and field sports such as football and tennis. It is performed in a controlled environment with a large emphasis on control and technique. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/fat-loss-advice-ben-carpenter-personal-trainer-b2751663.html"&gt;A personal trainer set out to learn everything he could about fat loss – this was his most important finding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="8" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dzgyhB"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/04/10/17/iStock-2155616069.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/04/10/17/iStock-2155616069.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/04/10/17/iStock-2155616069.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Strength training has benefits to offer people of all ages, says Dr Milo Wolf" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-210894"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Strength training has benefits to offer people of all ages, says Dr Milo Wolf&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has perks to offer people of all ages, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Especially as you get older, the body remembers,” says Wolf. “Even if you lifted, say, for a few years in your twenties or thirties, you will be better off for it in your sixties and seventies compared to someone who never lifted weights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s going to improve things like bone mineral density, which, as you age, helps reduce your risk of fractures and osteoporosis. Sarcopenia – the age-related loss of muscle mass and strength – is another big one [strength training helps to combat].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, Wolf describes lifting weights as the “single most powerful thing you can do for gaining muscle” – even beyond diet. And a strong body tends to be a robust body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is the first line of intervention for improving sarcopenia, bone density, muscle, and generally improving nearly all of your health markers, while reducing the risk of virtually every disease,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe you can get the vast majority of health benefits from exercise by simply lifting a few times a week and aiming for a daily step count of 8,000 to 12,000. That can be a really simple approach for not overthinking exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because as much as many people focus on things like VO2 max and mitochondrial health, this is fixating on correlates of health rather than actual all-cause mortality risk. So I think focusing on behaviours that make you healthier, rather than the metrics that are associated with good health, is probably a good thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/balance-exercise-plan-pilates-b2815218.html"&gt;The important thing your exercise plan is probably missing – particularly if you’re older&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNWDBiRjRzcHRXMWpDVlpvcXFhbTJZVkZBQU9kdnV3UVVHTnU5WkphZzJlVHk1cmp6aTdsRkxFdUdSd0xTWVYxdlVEUzZkSjg1aWJ0YTBGMlNES3JVd0k1bWMyRFJUU29PZW9nNklWaTFUVFhWQTFFQjltZTBuNGo2ZlR2dG9jVGtIS21CTzlFSV9McnA4Y29HSFZoeXF3U0QxWFR4Zk9RSDZJZw</guid></item><item><title>“我的女孩不能走路或说话” ：在威尔士的罕见疾病集群中寻找答案- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0qqvyrdkwo</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 jRDKjj"&gt;'My girl can't walk or talk': Searching for answers in Wales' rare disease cluster&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Rachel Cowley found out that her daughter Jessica has DRPLA in May this year&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Rachel Cowley's daughter Jessica was like any other 10-year-old until she started having seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Now aged 20, Jessica is unable to walk or talk, and Ms Cowley fears she will die in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I hope when the time comes it is quick," said Ms Cowley.

also known as the ATN1 gene, was crucial in understanding the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;If the gene expands in a large way "over multiple generations" a person will "probably have a more aggressive disease than [their] parent", explained Dr Wardle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;He said the current generation of DRPLA patients had, in this way, experienced "more severe disease".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"That's why it feels as if we've suddenly got more patients," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"When I first found patients with this disease in south Wales, they were in their 50s or 60s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Now we've got a cluster of patients in their 20s or 30s and that's why we're seeing that difference."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0

class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Dr Wardle said it was "very difficult" to diagnose DRPLA because it was "astonishingly rare" compared to similar conditions like epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Unless you've got a family history, people aren't even going to consider it," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;He said raising awareness about DRPLA was a "really good thing" as it would make people think about it earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Getting good access to neurological services and genetic testing is really important to push this forward," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But Dr Wardle said there were "moral and ethical issues" with testing people under the age of 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;He said people needed to be mature enough to "understand the consequences" of being tested for the "life-changing" condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"You can't do that if you're six or 12-years-old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I know of one patient who has been devastated by being screened for this disease," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;Clinical

treatment available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I think we'd change our approach because we want to identify those patients early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"But that would be on the basis of early access to treatment, which we don't have at the moment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The families affected in Wales said that clinical trials in the US for a potential treatment were providing "hope".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But Dr Wardle said these trials could "potentially" cause more harm to families by "raising expectations".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"There's a pipeline where you've got to prove safety and then prove efficacy, and you've got to do that right," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-86c96223-1 evkFpM"&gt;&lt;img
