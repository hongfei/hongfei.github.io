Published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jsxmed/qdae143" target="_blank"&gt;The Journal of Sexual Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the study offers new insights into sexual sensation and satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was designed to fill several gaps in the current scientific understanding of sexual sensation. Past research has often excluded people with vulvas, overlooked internal genital structures, or failed to quantify how important specific areas are to sexual pleasure. Additionally, there has been almost no systematic study of areas that individuals dislike having touched during sex—referred to in this research as aversive sensation zones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address these gaps, the research team created a detailed anatomical survey, approved by the Cedars-Sinai Institutional Review Board, that asked respondents to indicate which specific areas of the breasts, vulva, and vagina they found pleasurable or aversive during partnered sex. A total of 499 women completed the survey, but only the 441 who reported having had partnered sexual experience were included in the final analysis. Participants were between 18 and 83 years old, with an average age of 49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using anatomically precise illustrations of both external and internal genital structures, respondents selected specific zones they found pleasurable during sex and rated how important each zone was to their overall sexual pleasure on a 10-point scale. For aversive zones, they indicated which body parts they disliked being touched and selected from a list of potential reasons, such as pain, oversensitivity, shame, or past negative experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most frequently selected erogenous areas were in the vulva, with 82% of respondents identifying at least one pleasurable zone in that region. The vaginal introitus, periurethral area, and glans clitoris were the top three choices. (The vaginal introitus is the external opening of the vagina, the periurethral area is the region immediately surrounding the urethral opening, and the glans clitoris is the visible, sensitive tip of the clitoris.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The glans clitoris received the highest average importance rating of all areas in the study, with a score of 9 out of 10. This supports existing evidence that the clitoris plays a central role in sexual pleasure for many women, but the prominence of the vaginal introitus was an unexpected result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breast tissue and nipples were also commonly cited as sources of pleasure. About 58% of participants identified breast tissue as an erogenous zone, while 43% selected the nipples. However, the nipples were also the most frequently selected aversive zone among the breast subareas. Reasons given for nipple aversion included oversensitivity and pain. Notably, younger women were more likely to report pleasure in breast zones, suggesting some age-related variation in sensitivity or preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responses regarding the vagina highlighted the superficial anterior wall—often associated with the “G-spot”—as the most pleasurable area inside the vaginal canal. Nearly half of respondents selected this area, giving it a high average importance rating. Fewer people selected the cervix or deep vaginal walls, and these areas were more frequently flagged as aversive, primarily due to pain or discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anus was the most frequently selected aversive zone in the entire study, with 34% of participants reporting that they disliked its stimulation during sex. While 12% did identify it as pleasurable, the overwhelming majority of negative responses reflected not only physical discomfort but also emotional responses such as shame or embarrassment. This pattern persisted across different age groups, suggesting that cultural stigma around anal contact remains prevalent despite its growing visibility in media and sex education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although most results were consistent across demographic subgroups, age emerged as a meaningful variable. Younger respondents were more likely to identify a wider range of areas—across the breasts, vulva, and vagina—as pleasurable. This could reflect both generational differences in sexual norms and physiological differences related to hormonal changes. Many respondents were likely in perimenopause or menopause, a life stage known to impact genital sensation and libido.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings offer potential applications beyond academic research. Erogenous maps could help clinicians, therapists, and surgeons understand individual variability in sexual sensation, especially for people undergoing medical treatments or procedures that affect the genital area. For example, individuals recovering from cancer treatment, gender-affirming surgeries, or pelvic floor trauma may benefit from personalized sensation maps to monitor changes or tailor interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These maps also challenge conventional ideas about which body parts are considered “universally” pleasurable. For instance, while the glans clitoris is often highlighted in discussions about female sexual pleasure, this study suggests that other regions—like the vaginal introitus or the superficial anterior vaginal wall—are equally or even more significant for some women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aversive zone data provide insights into the emotional and psychological dimensions of sexual experience. Pain and oversensitivity were the most common reasons for aversion across all areas. But when it came to the anus, feelings of disgust and shame were disproportionately high. These emotional responses underscore the need for more open, nonjudgmental conversations about sexuality, as well as individualized sexual health education that respects diverse experiences and preferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its strengths—including a relatively large sample size and anatomically detailed illustrations—this study has limitations. Its retrospective and anonymous nature limited the amount of background information collected about participants. Only 62% of respondents had engaged in sexual activity within the year prior to the survey, which means that some data relied on recollections of older experiences. The survey also excluded transgender and gender-diverse individuals, so its findings cannot be generalized to all people with vulvas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could build on this study by including more diverse populations and tracking changes in sensation over time. For example, it would be useful to examine how erogenous and aversive zones shift after hormonal changes, medical treatments, or use of specific sexual health interventions such as pelvic floor therapy or vibratory stimulation. Studies could also investigate neuroplasticity—the brain’s ability to reorganize sensory maps—and how this might affect sexual function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study,  “&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jsm/article-abstract/22/1/7/7905380?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;Anatomic maps of erogenous and aversive sensation zones of the breasts, vulva, and vagina: A questionnaire-based study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jenna Stelmar, Michael Zaliznyak, Sandeep Sandhu, Dylan Isaacson, Erin Duralde, Shannon M.

Researchers found that dream recall is most strongly influenced by a person’s attitude toward dreams, their tendency to mind-wander, and specific sleep characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who value dreams more, daydream frequently, and experience longer sleep with less deep sleep are more likely to remember their dreams. These findings underscore the complex relationship between sleep, memory, and our waking thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attitude Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Valuing dreams is linked to more frequent recall, though not necessarily better content memory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind Wandering Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Frequent daydreamers tend to recall dreams more often, suggesting a shared mental process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep Pattern Influence:&lt;/strong&gt; Longer sleep duration with less deep sleep boosts dream recall; winter months see lower recall rates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;BIAL Foundation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Although almost everyone dreams, the ability to recall these experiences varies significantly between individuals. Research has sought to better understand this phenomenon by analysing the factors influencing dream recall. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results indicate that three main factors determine whether a person will remember their dream upon waking: attitude towards dreams, tendency to mind wandering, and sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dreams can be defined as subjective conscious experiences generated by our brain during sleep when we are significantly (although not totally) disconnected from the external environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These dream experiences draw on previously acquired memories and beliefs and therefore have relevant aspects of continuity with the thoughts, concerns, and salient experiences of our waking self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While scientific evidence suggests that most people dream during sleep and do so for a large part of the night, dream recall already seems to show large interindividual variability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although several studies have indicated female gender, younger age, a positive attitude towards dreaming, frequent daydreaming, and fantasy proneness as factors associated with a higher dream recall frequency, other investigations produced partially inconsistent or even contradictory results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the support of the BIAL Foundation, Giulio Bernardi (IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca, Italy) coordinated a study that sought to better understand this phenomenon by analysing the factors that influence dream recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, the team used a multimodal database that collected, between 2020 and 2024, dream reports, personal characteristics, and cognitive, psychometric, and neurophysiological measures in 217 healthy adults (18-70 years old, 116 females, 101 males).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article The individual determinants of morning dream recall, published in February in the journal &lt;em&gt;Communications Psychology,&lt;/em&gt; revealed the results of the research, pointing to three main factors that determine whether a person wakes up with the memory of the dream experience: the attitude towards dreams, the tendency to mind wandering, and sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding attitude towards dreams, the results indicate that people who attribute greater significance to dreaming are more likely to report the experience of dreaming upon waking, but this heightened interest does not necessarily enhance their ability to remember the content of their experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of note, although frequent dream recall may foster an interest in the meaning or significance of dreams, the direction of causality remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tendency to mind wandering emerges in this study as a robust positive predictor of dream recall. The association between mind wandering, so-called ‘daydreaming’, and observed dream recall may indicate a greater propensity to spontaneously generate dream-like experiences, regardless of external stimuli and vigilance states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed that dream recall seems to be influenced by sleep patterns, i.e., individuals who typically have long sleep episodes, coupled with a low proportion of deep sleep, show a greater probability of dream recall compared to those experiencing shorter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon also shows seasonal fluctuations, with dream recall typically being lower during Winter than during Spring and Autumn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these factors, individual differences in the ability to recall dream content depend on vulnerability to interference and age. Ageing can be associated with changes in sleep patterns – particularly a decrease in long and light sleep periods – which can affect dream recall processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research reinforces the idea that dreams are shaped by inter- and intra-individual factors, which opens up new perspectives for understanding their connection with memory and the human mind”, says Giulio Bernardi, emphasising that “the study of dreams is essential as it is known that they play an essential role in learning, in the memory consolidation and even in our mental and physical health”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this dream recall and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fundacaobial.com/com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Giulio Bernardi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fundacaobial.com/com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;BIAL Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Giulio Bernardi – BIAL Foundation&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-025-00191-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The individual determinants of morning dream recall&lt;/a&gt;” by Giulio Bernardi et al. &lt;em&gt;Communications Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The individual determinants of morning dream recall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that (almost) everyone dreams during their sleep and may actually do so for a large part of the night.

              &lt;p&gt;A common bacteria in our gut might be stirring up more trouble than we knew. A study out this week has found evidence that a mutagenic toxin produced by some strains of &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; can trigger early onset colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of California, San Diego led the research, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09025-8"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in Nature. They found a link between exposure to the toxin, called colibactin, and colorectal cancers more likely to happen in young adults. The findings could help explain why the rate of early onset colorectal cancer has mysteriously risen in recent years, though more research is needed to confirm a causative connection, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer, with roughly 150,000 Americans diagnosed with it every year. It’s also the second most leading cause of death by cancer, killing around 50,000 Americans annually.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As with many types of cancer, the incidence and death rate of colorectal cancer has been steadily declining over time. However, this decline isn’t equally distributed, since the incidence of colorectal cancer has been increasing in young and middle-aged adults. According to the American Cancer Society, rates of colorectal cancer among people younger than 50 have &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html"&gt;increased&lt;/a&gt; by 2.4% per year between 2012 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists aren’t sure why these cancers have become more common in younger Americans, though some research has pointed the finger at &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/colorectal-cancer-in-young-people#:~:text=Sedentary%20lifestyle%2C%20overweight%20and%20obesity%2C%20smoking%2C%20heavy%20alcohol%20use%2C%20low%2Dfiber%2C%20high%2Dfat%20diets%20or%20diets%20high%20in%20processed%20meats%2C%20and%20other%20environmental%20factors%20have%20all%20been%20associated%20with%20the%20disease"&gt;processed foods, higher obesity rates, and other lifestyle factors&lt;/a&gt;. But this new study appears to add another suspect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study researchers weren’t specifically looking to unravel this mystery; they were more interested in understanding why some parts of the world have higher reported rates of colorectal cancer than others. To do so, they analyzed the genetic signature of colorectal cancers taken from nearly 1,000 people across the world. These samples included people with both late and early onset cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Colibactin is already known to cause mutations in our cells that could raise the risk of cancer, and past studies have linked it to colorectal cancer. But the researchers were surprised to find that colibactin-related mutations were about three times more commonly found in the early onset cancers they studied compared to the late onset cancers. They also found molecular evidence that these colibactin-related mutations tend to show up early in a tumor’s development, suggesting they play a vital role in fueling these cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Coupled with other research showing that colibactin-related mutations often appear in the first ten years of life, the authors argue that this toxin could be a major instigator of early onset colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These mutation patterns are a kind of historical record in the genome, and they point to early-life exposure to colibactin as a driving force behind early-onset disease,” said senior study author Ludmil Alexandrov, a researchers specializing in cancer genomics at UC San Diego, in a &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/childhood-exposure-to-bacterial-toxin-may-be-triggering-colorectal-cancer-epidemic-among-the-young"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers note that colibactin may still only be one big piece of a larger puzzle. They note that colibactin-related mutations were rarely found in more rural parts of the world. So it’s possible that other environmental factors like diet or antibiotic use are encouraging the growth of colibactin-producing &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; bacteria in the gut in places like the U.S. Outside of colibactin, there might be other exposures that could explain higher cancer rates in different countries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the team’s findings do provide fertile ground for future research, and could possibly even lead to interventions that could slow or reverse the rise in early onset colorectal cancer. The researchers are already hoping to study whether probiotics might be able to eliminate these more harmful &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;stains, and they’re trying to develop early detection tests that can screen for colibactin-related mutations.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;All of this work, however, is contingent on further funding. And the researchers are quick to note that the U.S. government under President Donald Trump has &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/24/trump-100-days-nih-new-grants-cut/"&gt;aggressively limited funding&lt;/a&gt; from the National Institutes of Health in recent months—the same sort of funding that might go to important cancer research like theirs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If NIH funding cuts impact our ability to do this work, that will be, in my opinion, a substantial hit to cancer research not just in the U.S., but globally,” said Alexandrov. “Our funding has allowed us to collaborate with cancer researchers around the world, collecting and analyzing large datasets from patient samples in multiple countries. That kind of scale is what makes discoveries like this possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

In a diverse group of participants aged 19 to 86, they found an inverted U-shaped pattern: LC signal peaked in late middle age, then declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a strong LC signal after age 60 was tied to better cognitive performance, while sharper peaks were observed in women and Black participants—groups disproportionately affected by Alzheimer’s. These findings highlight the LC’s role in healthy aging and underscore the need for diverse research samples in brain health studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blue Spot Trajectory:&lt;/strong&gt; LC signal intensity peaks in late middle age, then declines with age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher LC signal after age 60 correlates with better cognition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demographic Variation:&lt;/strong&gt; Black participants and women showed higher LC neuromelanin peaks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Cornell University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a demographically diverse sample of healthy people, Cornell researchers found dramatic changes over the human lifespan in the brain’s “blue spot” – a tiny region involved in cognition and believed to be the first affected by neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using specialized MRI scans to measure the intensity of neuromelanin, a pigment that gives the locus coeruleus (LC) its blue color, the research team observed an inverted U-shaped curve that peaked in later middle age before dropping off sharply, a finding that helps characterize healthy aging patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a stronger blue signal after age 60 was associated with better cognitive performance, according to the study involving 134 participants aged 19 to 86. Because of the participants’ diversity, including about 40% who were non-white, the researchers also discovered higher peaks among Black participants and women, groups known to be more susceptible to Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By examining the health of the locus coeruleus and its relation to cognitive aging processes, these data may reveal when an individual is on a healthy aging trajectory and advance our understanding of why certain groups may have higher incidence of Alzheimer’s disease later in life,” said Adam Anderson, professor in the Department of Psychology and the College of Human Ecology (CHE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results showed underlying similarities in LC risk markers across the lifespan, but areas of specific concern for distinct demographic groups, especially for some that have been underrepresented in medical research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were reported in “Age-related Differences in Locus Coeruleus Intensity Across a Demographically Diverse Sample,” published March 17 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Neurobiology of Aging&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cornell team included Anderson and Eve De Rosa, the Mibs Martin Follett Associate Professor in Human Ecology (CHE) and dean of faculty, who co-lead the Affect and Cognition Lab (ACLAB); Khena Swallow, associate professor in the Department of Psychology and the College of Arts and Sciences; and ACLAB members Elizabeth Riley, a research associate and the paper’s first author; Nicholas Cicero ’20; and Senegal Mabry, a doctoral student in the field of neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Located deep in the brainstem, the locus coeruleus is the primary source of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter crucial for attention, memory, stress responses and even sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is thought to be the brain region most vulnerable to Alzheimer’s pathology, potentially affected years or decades before symptoms show. Thus, a better understanding of normal and abnormal LC aging trajectories is considered crucial to earlier detection of such diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain scans performed at the Cornell MRI Facility showed a consistent general pattern in healthy individuals’ LC signal intensity, regardless of education, income, and history of early trauma. Increased neuromelanin levels in midlife were associated with better cognition and decreases after age 60 with poorer cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ongoing research is exploring ways to help sustain healthy levels, potentially through practices such as deep breathing or stimulation of the vagus nerve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why the two subgroups showed more dramatic peaks in LC neuromelanin intensity is unclear, but the researchers said they are consistent with a theory of compensation: Overtaxing one’s brain and stressful living, which involves the LC, could be beneficial in the short term but deplete function later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the locus coeruleus is required for alertness, focus and memory,” Anderson said, “heightened neuromelanin can also be a sign of overactivity and is implicated in depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, all of which are risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s racial and socioeconomic diversity – key to the findings’ overall generalizability and specific insights about subgroups – was achieved through a collaboration with the Community Recruitment Research Accelerator, a project of SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project seeks to increase diverse community participation in brain health research, partnering with a community recruitment liaison to reduce barriers to participation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study illustrates the importance of diverse samples in studying brain health,” Anderson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Diverse samples are necessary to generalize study results to the larger population, and a critical form of scientific validity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was supported by the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this cognitive aging and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2842494c1d1b1c684b475a464d4444064d4c5d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;James Dean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.cornell.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cornell University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;James Dean – Cornell University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2025.03.005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Age-related differences in locus coeruleus intensity across a demographically diverse sample&lt;/a&gt;” by Adam Anderson et al. &lt;em&gt;Neurobiology of Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age-related differences in locus coeruleus intensity across a demographically diverse sample&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the trajectory of &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; locus coeruleus (LC) signal intensity across the adult lifespan and among various demographic groups, particularly during middle age, may be crucial for early detection of neurodegenerative diseases, which begin in the LC decades before symptom onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though pathological changes in the LC are thought to begin in middle age, its characteristics across the adult lifespan, and its consistency and variation across demographic groups, remain not well understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using T1-weighted turbo spin echo magnetic resonance (MRI) scans to characterize the LC, we measured LC signal intensity in 134 participants aged 19–86 years, with an effort to recruit a more racially diverse sample (41 % non-White).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LC signal intensity was lowest in early adulthood, peaked around age 60, and then decreased again in the oldest adults, particularly in the caudal portion of the LC, which exhibited the greatest overall signal intensity; education, income, and history of early trauma did not alter this general pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rostral LC signal intensity was further heightened in women and Black participants. In higher-performing older adults, increased rostral LC signal intensity was positively associated with higher fluid cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The potential accumulation of LC signal intensity across the adult lifespan and its possible dissipation in later life as well as its modification by demographic factors, may be associated with differential susceptibility to neurocognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 15:29:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZEFVX3lxTE1WMVM5aFoxeUFEODJoMjBObm9FYTJfVXo1YVQ1ZmFQQU9EVTFUMTAwcUt0c29CQ3VDVlVrdlhBaGlPT3V6RGkxZURVQUZJNmxNYnIyWEdSVDJUVFd0eGNfQTUtR0c</guid></item><item><title>减少异亮氨酸是延长33%寿命的关键- Earth.com | Reducing isoleucine is the key to a 33% longer life - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxOTGVQREtBd3ZvUXo1QkZ3S09xNW1WUlc3LVZBaVVIRlZfaTd5WmJsYXdRWGVLRFRMOGE1cmx4TWVVY3VIVG8tTVpGaGlXT3huMmx6UWxNNjBPN1pTb1ZpNXp5c2g2b2x4c1Y3SmVIalNrMW5hMlNOaXVtMDViNDA4dW1GNTI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Middle-aged mice lived 33% longer when they cut back on one particular dietary building block. This finding has grabbed attention because it suggests a simple strategy that may support &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/leg-balance-is-a-key-indicator-of-healthy-aging/"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work comes from research teams who tracked how limiting the isoleucine in rodent meals boosted their longevity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach was led by metabolism researcher &lt;a href="https://www.medicine.wisc.edu/directory/lamming_dudley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dudley Lamming&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Wisconsin, US, and colleagues who also observed improved blood sugar control and leaner physiques among the animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-isoleucine-s-role-in-healthy-aging"&gt;Isoleucine’s role in healthy aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Different components of your diet have value and impact beyond their function as a calorie, and we’ve been digging in on one component that many people may be eating too much of,” explained Lamming, who was involved in these mouse experiments, in 2023. Isoleucine is an essential part of our diet, yet some people consume too much of it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too much of this amino acid has been linked to unhealthy weight gain. The mix of amino acids in a person’s diet is now seen as an important factor in metabolic health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher intake of the branched-chain amino acid isoleucine has been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11185563/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to increased body mass index in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-isoleucine-restriction-extends-lifespan"&gt;Isoleucine restriction extends lifespan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male mice on reduced-isoleucine chow experienced lifespan increases of about a third. They also handled glucose better and stayed slimmer even while allowed to eat more total calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restricting isoleucine did not require complicated food measurements. It simply involved changing the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-model-esm3-creates-new-protein-that-simulates-500-million-years-of-biological-evolution/"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; proportions in their daily ration so that isoleucine was the limiting factor. The mice were allowed to eat freely, which makes the results even more surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-male-female-variation-in-isoleucine-restriction"&gt;Male-female variation in isoleucine restriction&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, male mice showed a 33% boost in lifespan, while females only gained about 7%. This big gap raises questions about how sex hormones, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-metabolism-has-evolved-to-become-energetically-unique/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, and body composition may influence how the body responds to amino acid changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have seen similar patterns before with other nutrient-based interventions. Hormonal differences can affect fat storage, muscle metabolism, and how energy is used, which may explain why the same diet creates different results depending on sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-health-gains-from-limiting-isoleucine-intake"&gt;Health gains from limiting isoleucine intake&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s interesting and encouraging to think a dietary change could still make such a big difference,” said Lamming. Such results spark optimism for ways to support &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/experts-say-this-is-the-best-fruit-to-eat-for-a-healthier-liver/"&gt;healthier&lt;/a&gt; aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists believe that trimming isoleucine intake helps the body regulate insulin activity, which in turn aids energy balance and metabolic stability. The 2021 study in mice supports the idea that altered amino acid levels can reprogram liver function and fat storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-risks-and-rewards-of-isoleucine-reduction"&gt;Risks and rewards of isoleucine reduction&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts note that isoleucine is one of three branched-chain amino acids needed for survival, so eliminating it is not an option. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hemp-seeds-could-be-a-game-changer-as-an-alternative-protein-source/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Higher-protein foods&lt;/a&gt; like eggs, dairy, soy, and meats typically provide ample amounts of it, which can be troublesome for those at risk of excessive intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle adjustments must be approached carefully, because going too low in protein can also cause problems. “We can’t just switch everyone to a low-isoleucine diet,” Lamming said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-incorporating-isoleucine-limited-foods-into-daily-meals"&gt;Incorporating isoleucine-limited foods into daily meals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who eat mostly &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/meat-protein-boosts-survival-but-plants-boost-longevity/"&gt;animal-based foods&lt;/a&gt; may be getting more isoleucine than they realize. Meats, dairy, and eggs are especially rich in branched-chain amino acids, including isoleucine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swapping some of these foods for plant-based proteins – like beans, lentils, or tofu – could be a practical way to bring levels down without under-eating protein altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t about extreme dieting. It’s more about tweaking food choices to reduce excess. Since isoleucine is just one of many amino acids, small shifts in dietary sources might be enough to improve long-term health without sacrificing nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-next-steps-in-isoleucine-focused-research-and-treatment"&gt;Next steps in isoleucine-focused research and treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe more targeted changes, including drugs that block how the body processes isoleucine, may one day be explored. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some observers hope physicians and dietitians might soon personalize amino acid profiles for specific health needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A short-term trial &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27346343/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;indicated&lt;/a&gt; that low-protein diets can reduce weight and improve metabolic markers even without cutting overall calories. Such findings hint that translating the rodent results to human benefits is not far-fetched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-prospects-for-isoleucine-and-healthy-aging"&gt;Future prospects for isoleucine and healthy aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many see this approach as a clue about the intricate links between diet and aging. These rodent models give reason to think that certain dietary tweaks could support longevity in people too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators emphasize that fine-tuning is key. They plan to keep studying how these food-based strategies could be adapted into safe recommendations for adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any future guidance will need to balance nutrient needs, metabolic responses, and practical eating habits across different age groups and lifestyles.

A new medication called donanemab appears to slow memory loss, giving patients the gift of more time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UW Medicine's &lt;a href="https://depts.washington.edu/mbwc/" target="_blank" title="https://depts.washington.edu/mbwc/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Memory &amp;amp; Brain Wellness Center&lt;/a&gt; at Harborview Medical Center recently started treating patients with the drug. Bob Pringle is one of the first patients in Seattle to receive donanemab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They already tell me it won’t cure it. It won’t stop it," Pringle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While not a cure, donanemab does have promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know that I will progress with memory loss, and I’ve accepted that," Pringle said. "I’m just hoping that this process is going to slow that down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He already has issues with his memory. Pringle enjoyed a 30-year career with the Seattle Fire Department. While photos show him going from recruit to captain of the arson investigation team, he says he can't remember much about it. He hopes denanemab helps him hang onto the remaining memories of his family - his wife, two children, and grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pringle will receive 18 infusions once a month for the next year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2807533" target="_blank" title="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2807533" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Donanemab is designed &lt;/a&gt;to teach his immune system to remove proteins from his brain that lead to dementia. It could extend his quality of life by months, buying time while science works towards a cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the first time, we have a disease-modifying treatment that can interfere with the biology of Alzheimer's disease and lead to a better outcome in the patient’s eyes," said Dr. Thomas Grabowski, medical director of the Memory and Brain Wellness Center. "There’s a sense of hopefulness that this medicine has brought with it. And that’s gratifying to be part of that. We’ve worked many years to get to this point, and to be able to honestly say we have the first effective treatment for this disease is really a good feeling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donanemab works similarly to lecanemab, &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/local-study-prevent-alzheimers-disease-help-family-medicine-health-seattle-washington-science-lecanemab-medication-beard-university-of-washington-ahead-study-brain#" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/local/local-study-prevent-alzheimers-disease-help-family-medicine-health-seattle-washington-science-lecanemab-medication-beard-university-of-washington-ahead-study-brain#" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;another promising Alzheimer's drug.&lt;/a&gt; Patients on lecanemab need infusions every two weeks, while donanemab is administered once a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between his infusions, Bob and his wife Tina have plans to go on a cruise, making new memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We still travel," Tina said. "And he’s able to. I have to take more of the responsibility, of course, but I’m happy to do so. So as long as he can keep enjoying life, that’s the goal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a big goal - wrapped in a small pouch of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That’s hope in that little tiny bag," Tina said.

A new study reveals that only children experience greater emotional and financial stress when caring for aging parents, and support from friends or extended family doesn’t offer the same relief it does for those with siblings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of shared family history and emotional backup can make caregiving more isolating for only children. Researchers emphasize the importance of early, honest conversations between parents and their adult children to set expectations and ease the emotional burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Burden:&lt;/strong&gt; Only children face more emotional and financial strain when caregiving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Gap:&lt;/strong&gt; Help from friends doesn’t provide the same relief as sibling support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing Trend:&lt;/strong&gt; The number of single-child families in the U.S. has doubled in recent decades.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Missouri-Columbia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caring for an aging parent is one of life’s most meaningful — and challenging — experiences. For adults who grew up as only children, that task often comes without support. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No siblings to share the stress, split costs or take turns during long nights — just one person carrying the entire load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it’s a growing issue. Single-child families are becoming more common in the United States, increasing from about 10% to 20% in recent decades. This means more aging parents will be relying on just one adult child for care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109129"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc.jpg" alt="This shows an adult daughter and dad." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/only-child-caregiver-neuroscienc-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;One is that only children often have especially close bonds with their parents and may rely on them for emotional support. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, research from the University of Missouri confirms what many adult only children have long felt: Caregiving is hard — and it’s even harder when you’re doing it alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, Hana Skoblow and Megan Gilligan from Mizzou’s College of Education and Human Development analyzed national data from 1,773 adults caring for aging parents. Of those, 12% were only children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that caregiving stress looks different depending on whether someone has siblings, and adult only children were more likely to face emotional and financial strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their study also showed that while support from friends or extended family often improves mental health for caregivers with siblings, it doesn’t have the same effect for only children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Families with multiple kids can lean on each other for help,” Skoblow, a postdoctoral fellow and lead author, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But only children don’t necessarily have that built-in support system. Even when they receive help from friends or extended family, it doesn’t seem to provide the same relief.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the exact reason isn’t clear, Skoblow and Gilligan offer a few possible explanations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One is that only children often have especially close bonds with their parents and may rely on them for emotional support. When a parent begins to need care, that emotional safety net can vanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that only children may struggle to share their challenges, especially when the person they normally confided in is now the one they’re caring for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The lack of siblings means there’s no one else who shares the family history or truly understands the emotional dynamics,” Skoblow said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That can make the experience feel even more isolating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Skoblow acknowledges sibling tension is not unusual when caring for a parent, particularly when one sibling feels like they’re doing more than their fair share, the current study was limited to comparing only children to those with siblings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start the conversation early&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Skoblow and Gilligan stress the importance of starting conversations about caregiving sooner than later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adult children and their parents may each have ideas about what caregiving should look like,” Gilligan, an associate professor in human development and family science, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If they don’t talk about it ahead of time, those expectations might not line up, and that can make a hard situation even harder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being open about what everyone wants, and what they can realistically offer, can make the experience smoother and strengthen the relationship in the process, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The parents’ perspective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers want to flip the script by asking parents how they feel about being cared for by their only child. It’s part of Skoblow and Gilligan’s future research to understand more about how different family structures, care distributions and emotional responses are related to the experiences of both adult children and their parents — regardless of family structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Do they feel guilty? Do they try not to ask for help? Are they worried about being a burden?” Gilligan said. “We want to better understand both sides of the relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3f4c4b5e51515a7f52564c4c504a4d56115a5b4a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Stann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://missouri.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Missouri-Columbia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Eric Stann – University of Missouri-Columbia&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnaf006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stressors and Resources Among Adult Child Caregivers in the Presence or Absence of Siblings&lt;/a&gt;” by Hana Skoblow et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Gerontologist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stressors and Resources Among Adult Child Caregivers in the Presence or Absence of Siblings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background and Objectives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent attention has focused on understanding later-life caregiving networks, emphasizing how multiple adult children within the same family navigate parental care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, families with one child are increasingly common, and we know little about how adult only children experience caregiving and whether their experiences differ from those with siblings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, this study assessed differences in caregiving experiences between adult child caregivers with and without siblings and whether associations between caregiving experiences and mental health (i.e., psychological well-being and distress) vary by sibling presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research Design and Methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used cross-sectional data from 1,773 adult child caregivers (12% without siblings; &lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 56.75 [9.23]) in the National Health and Aging Trends Study and National Study of Caregiving. We conducted &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; tests and a series of multivariate regressions with interactions to test hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adult only child caregivers reported more financial difficulty with care than respondents with siblings. The negative association between emotional difficulty of care and psychological well-being was stronger among adult children without siblings. Informal support was positively associated with psychological well-being only for adult children with siblings, although this may be accounted for by race and ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion and Implications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings suggest that adult only children may be at elevated risks of the financial difficulties and the emotional consequences of parental care provision. Further, informal support may be less protective for adult only children’s well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the increasing prevalence of single-child families, more research is needed to better understand and support adult only children caring for parents.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 14:21:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE5QZUlBcExNODZtblo1U0JVMXpRRGFGcFNMaWhmcVdvbUJVV001U19pWlo1MjNGdXFYUWF5WmV2cU9TNjJuSTE1NFhNekp2Rzd5bDk4YnE4Q2plekZxV3hSNktmaTFLQzhvSlVGMU1UWXpsSWN1U1E</guid></item><item><title>神经重新布线可能是精神病恢复的关键-神经科学新闻 | Neural Rewiring May Hold the Key to Psychosis Recovery - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE1GclhtTFpTenBKc3NTTE1KeVVPejBoMERGR3gzMUMtVS1IaS1kNF85LUNrc3BaTEtJQ0RSaWkwdWdOSkcySVE3VmRMbEw4YWtRWkp6LWotcXNFT0V2UV96bVlLOVJNalhWcXpSbXNGMFBrS1MxUV91WXN3cGJuQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study has uncovered the brain connectivity patterns that differentiate patients who recover from psychosis from those who do not. Using whole-brain computational models, researchers found that patients in remission show increased neural connectivity, while those with persistent symptoms show reduced connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both groups exhibited lower overall neural stability than healthy individuals, but only recovering patients adapted their connectivity in a way that supports recovery. This refined understanding may allow clinicians to predict the course of psychosis and tailor treatments accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connectivity Patterns:&lt;/strong&gt; Psychosis remission is associated with increased brain connectivity, while persistence is linked to decreased connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive Modeling:&lt;/strong&gt; Computational models can now help predict individual patient outcomes based on brain scans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precision Medicine:&lt;/strong&gt; Digital brain twins could test the effects of treatments before application, personalizing care.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UPF Barcelona&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A study led by Pompeu Fabra University reveals which brain mechanisms allow psychosis to remit. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this pioneering research could have important clinical implications for exploring new intervention strategies in patients with psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was carried out in collaboration with one of the main psychiatry groups at Lausanne University Hospital (Switzerland).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109125"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-neural-networks-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Thus, the differences between the neural connectivity patterns of people whose psychosis has remitted and subjects with persistent symptoms were explored. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study examines differences in the neural connectivity patterns of patients who have recovered from psychosis and subjects who have not. Identifying these differences using computational models has enabled determining which patterns of neural connectivity facilitate the remission of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the research have recently been published in an article in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its principal author is Ludovica Mana, a doctor and neuroscientist of the Computational Neuroscience group at the UPF Center for Brain and Cognition (CBC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main co-investigators are Gustavo Deco and Manel-Vila Vidal, director and researcher with the same research group, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study focuses on psychosis, the serious mental disorder that causes abnormal, disconnected ideas and perceptions of reality, the main symptoms of which are delusions or hallucinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Spain, psychosis affects 1.2% of the population, according to&lt;a href="https://www.sanidad.gob.es/estadEstudios/estadisticas/estadisticas/estMinisterio/SIAP/Salud_mental_datos.pdf"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;data from the Spanish Ministry of Health (2020). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around the world, it is estimated that between 1.5 and 3.5% of the population may be diagnosed with psychosis during their lifetime (Calabrese and Al Khalili, 2023).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team analysed the MRI brain scans of 88 patients at Lausanne Hospital in the early stages of psychosis and 128 healthy individuals (control group). Thus, the differences between the neural connectivity patterns of people whose psychosis has remitted and subjects with persistent symptoms were explored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Neural connectivity increases when psychosis remits and decreases when the opposite is true&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of this comparative analysis, significant differences have been found in the activity of the brain network of the two patient groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, they present opposite connectivity patterns: the neural connectivity of patients with persistent symptoms of psychosis decreases, while it increases among people with remitting psychotic episodes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using whole-brain computational models, the study found that both groups have lower overall stability of neuronal connections than healthy patients. The changes undergone by neuronal connections could be due to the brain’s need to adapt to a situation of poor conductivity, caused by psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, among recovering patients, changes in the pattern of neural connectivity contribute more widely and effectively to the remission of the disease. This would explain the empirical and clinical differences of the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Refined computational methods enable predicting a patient’s natural evolution after their first psychotic episodes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gustavo Deco (UPF) points out that this study “allows us to predict a patient’s natural evolution after their first psychotic episodes”, thanks to the “refinement” of the computational models of the whole brain that allow us mechanistically to analyse its functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, “these whole-brain models are the best and only example of a genuine implementation of precision medicine from digital brain twins”, he states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, these models were limited to explaining the mechanisms underlying different brain states, that of psychosis, for instance, which was very useful in the first phase. But, now in the second phase, they allow reproducing the individualized brain mechanisms of specific patients, in the line of so-called precision medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, they are not only capable of explaining the state of the brain at a specific time, but also of beginning to predict its temporal evolution or even its evolution based on the effect of different pharmacological or electromagnetic treatments that can be tested first using computational models”, Deco explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ludovica Mana (UPF) adds: “This study highlights the need to challenge ourselves and change our outlook: first, going beyond broad diagnostic categories to better understand the diversity of patient experiences, and second, recognizing that computational methods, when carefully combined with clinical knowledge, can really help us further our understanding of mental disorders”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of this study could have important clinical implications for exploring new intervention strategies in patients with psychosis, hence the need to continue advancing in this line of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychosis research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bad3c8dfd4df94cadfd3c8d5facfcadc94dfdecf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Irene Peiró&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://upf.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UPF Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Irene Peiró – UPF Barcelona&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44220-025-00394-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subgroup-specific brain connectivity alterations in early stages of psychosis&lt;/a&gt;” by Ludovica Mana et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subgroup-specific brain connectivity alterations in early stages of psychosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functional brain scans have shown that connectivity alterations are strongly associated with the first episode of psychosis, yet it is not well understood whether these alterations vary with the clinical status of patients at the time of scanning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cross-sectional study aimed to identify brain connectivity properties that differentiate remitting and non-remitting early psychosis (EP) patients from healthy controls and to explore the mechanisms underlying these differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To this end, we analyzed resting-state fMRI and DSI data from 88 EP patients categorized by their remission ability after the first episode of psychosis. We focused on differences between stage III remitting–relapsing (EP3R) and stage III non-remitting (EP3NR) patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opposing functional connectivity (FC) alterations were observed: EP3NR patients exhibited lower FC compared with controls, while EP3R patients showed higher FC, possibly reflecting compensatory mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole-brain network modeling revealed lower local stability affecting the ability to regulate the flow of stimuli across the network in stage III patients, particularly in EP3R, which may indicate an adaptation to impaired network conductivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight subgroup-specific brain alterations and underscore the importance of considering this source of heterogeneity in psychosis research.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 13:55:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE1GclhtTFpTenBKc3NTTE1KeVVPejBoMERGR3gzMUMtVS1IaS1kNF85LUNrc3BaTEtJQ0RSaWkwdWdOSkcySVE3VmRMbEw4YWtRWkp6LWotcXNFT0V2UV96bVlLOVJNalhWcXpSbXNGMFBrS1MxUV91WXN3cGJuQQ</guid></item><item><title>由于其独特的饮食习惯，新国家可能成为蓝区-每日邮报 | New country emerges as possible Blue Zone thanks to its unique diet - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxNeHlteW9WVFJDb0Ixa1h2RnBXckUzdThucEFCSldUNk9WaGJ2aEVJQmlLZ2hBSTBxR3VNMzNMLWNucjJnYmNIVHlab0lXU3pPVEl2NEtFMV9SV2lzQ2ZBSGpxbUVqdllIcnROWGY0VGpMT2pyT09Sbnk5eUVLVlU4bXdmOUpRbjZsbUZrX2Fnd1RJYmhKNTRTbFBVQ3hrWTMwdEdwV241eUtxeElyV2t5elcySGVWUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Mediterranean diet has long been hailed as the healthiest way to eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Emphasizing lean fish, leafy green vegetables and healthy fats like avocado and olive oil, the diet has roots dating back to ancient &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/greece/index.html" id="mol-1bd85750-213d-11f0-96ca-f5628efc8e80" class=""&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; and Rome, which are now dubbed Blue Zones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blue Zones are places lauded as longevity hotspots with low rates of chronic disease and significant amounts of people living well into their 90s and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though the Mediterranean diet has &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/wellness-us/article-12938849/weight-loss-2024-calorie-counting.html"&gt;earned the title of healthiest fare year after year&lt;/a&gt;, the cuisine a nation in Africa could soon take its place.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/the-netherlands/index.html" id="mol-cbafa750-2142-11f0-96ca-f5628efc8e80" class=""&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; researchers earlier this month found people in Tanzania, which sits on the southeastern edge of Africa bordering Kenya, are far healthier than western nations due to a focus on unprocessed, traditional foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Tanzanian Kilimanjaro diet, named after the volcano Mount Kilimanjaro, focuses on foods like okra, plantains and beans, and drinks like mbege, made with fermented banana and the grain millet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found men who followed the Kilimanjaro diet had significantly lower levels of inflammation and stronger immune systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts behind the study believe it's the diet's lack of processed food that keeps inflammation at bay, lowering the risk of chronic diseases and possibly extending lifespan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tanzania's traditional diet focuses on unprocessed, natural foods like vegetables, legumes and grains.

This included eating corn, okra, plantains, kidney beans and avocados. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another 22 on the western diet also were asked to drink one serving of mbege every day for a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Five men who maintained their normal diets were used as controls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found people who switched from the Kilimanjaro to the western diet had higher levels of inflammatory proteins in their blood. Their immune cells were also less effective in warding off pathogens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors said the western diet showed 'systemic inflammation and metabolic dysregulation.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'Blue Zones' are places lauded as longevity hotspots with low rates of chronic diseases and significant amounts of people living well into their 90s and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dietitians recommend snacking on fruit to take advantage of the Kilimanjaro diet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who switched to the Kilimanjaro eating plan, however, saw the opposite effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The changes to inflammation levels were still detectable via blood samples for four weeks after the study ended, suggesting the Tanzanian diet had long-lasting benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Inflammation is at the root of many chronic conditions, which makes this study highly relevant for Western countries as well,' Dr. de Mast said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, while this diet seems to have similar effects as the one that came out of the Mediterranean, Tanzania itself is not considered a Blue Zone. &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-9807859/US-life-expectancy-falls-WWII-77-3-amid-COVID-19-pandemic-CDC-report-finds.html" class=""&gt;The average life expectancy is 67 - in the US, it is 77.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Greece and Italy - two countries that adhere to the Mediterranean diet - have an average life expectancy of 82 and 84 years old, respectively. They are each home to one of the world's five Blue Zones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the latest data, Tanzania had a cancer rate of 140 cases per 100,000 people in 2022, significantly lower than 445 per 100,000 in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tanzania records about 44,000 cancer cases per year compared to roughly 2 million in the US, though Tanzania has a significantly smaller population - there are roughly 66 million people in Tanzania compared to 330 million in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both countries have roughly equal diabetes rates, with one in 10 adults being diagnosed with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sapna Peruvemba, a dietitian at Health by Sapna, told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://vegnews.com/tanzania-kilimanjaro-style-diet"&gt;VegNews&lt;/a&gt; those who want to follow the Tanzanian diet should focus on building meals around vegetables, fruits and legumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The diet plan also includes fermented foods like sauerkraut and kimchi, which have probiotics that have been shown to promote the production of disease-fighting antibodies and anti-inflammatory compounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As Peruvemba says, 'Don’t underestimate the power of returning to the basics.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 13:49:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxNeHlteW9WVFJDb0Ixa1h2RnBXckUzdThucEFCSldUNk9WaGJ2aEVJQmlLZ2hBSTBxR3VNMzNMLWNucjJnYmNIVHlab0lXU3pPVEl2NEtFMV9SV2lzQ2ZBSGpxbUVqdllIcnROWGY0VGpMT2pyT09Sbnk5eUVLVlU4bXdmOUpRbjZsbUZrX2Fnd1RJYmhKNTRTbFBVQ3hrWTMwdEdwV241eUtxeElyV2t5elcySGVWUQ</guid></item><item><title>30多岁时的这3个坏习惯会影响以后的心理健康-神经科学新闻 | These 3 Bad Habits in Your 30s Impact Later Mental Health - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE5yOFA4Rm9yRjhZTFd5T0o1RHhXT3FuMzk1NExhYW9HOFJ1aWJYVUg3alhBRVlhU1FXSUh2YkFuR0NSTTU5ZUF1QVgybmdvcnN4YW8yMFZ6el84V1hmSkFrSmcybEdfOTQ3R1dCeFlQT0tCbXVU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A decades-long study in Finland reveals that smoking, heavy drinking, and physical inactivity in early adulthood are strongly linked to declining physical and mental health by age 36. Participants with all three habits showed elevated depression symptoms, higher metabolic risk, and lower self-rated health and wellbeing scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These effects were even more pronounced in those who maintained unhealthy habits over the long term. The researchers stress the importance of adopting healthy behaviors early in life to avoid compounded health risks later on, though even midlife changes can offer benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Unhealthy habits already harm physical and mental health by age 36.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cumulative Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Long-term engagement in smoking, drinking, and inactivity worsens health outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavior-Specific Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Smoking primarily affects mental health, inactivity impacts physical health, and drinking negatively affects both.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Taylor and Francis Group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad habits such as smoking, heavy drinking and lack of exercise must be tackled as early as possible to boost the odds of a happy and healthy old age.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is the message of a new peer-reviewed study, published in the &lt;em&gt;Annals of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; (Elevate), that found smoking and other vices are associated with declines in health in people as young as 36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact is even greater when these bad habits are indulged in over the long-term, state experts whose study tracked the mental and physical health of hundreds of people for more than 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has followed people from middle-age, typically for around 20 years.  Studies to-date have shown that smoking and other aspects of a healthy lifestyle are adapted before the age of 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in this new study a research team from Finland wanted to track people from a younger age – and to unpick, at the same time, the effect of unhealthy habits on mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a long-running longitudinal study, in which hundreds of children who were born in the Finnish city of Jyväskylä in 1959 were followed from childhood until their early 60s, the team analyzed participants’ mental and physical health via data that was collected from surveys and medicals when they were 27 years old (326 participants) and again at age 36, 42, 50 and 61 (206 participants).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health was assessed via surveys on symptoms of depression and on psychological wellbeing. Physical health was assessed by creating a metabolic risk score based on blood pressure, waist size and levels of blood sugar, cholesterol and other blood fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-health was assessed by asking the participants to rate the state of their health over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three risky behaviours were also assessed at each point in time: smoking, heavy drinking (defined as consuming at least 7,000g/875 units of alcohol a year for women and 10,000g/1,250 units a year for men) and physical inactivity (exercising less than once a week).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the results showed that if an individual had all three unhealthy habits – they smoked, drank heavily and were inactive – at a given point in time, their mental and physical health were poorer than if they didn’t have any of these risky behaviours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depressive symptoms rose by 0.1 points, metabolic risk score rose by 0.53 points, psychological wellbeing fell by 0.1 point and self-rated health fell by 0.45 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depressive symptoms and psychological wellbeing was measured on a scale of 1-4; self-rated health was measured on a scale of 1-5; and metabolic risk was scored from 0-5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having all three unhealthy behaviours long-term was even more strongly associated with poor health.  Depressive symptoms rose by 0.38 points, metabolic risk score rose by 1.49 points, psychological wellbeing fell by 0.14 points and self-rated health fell by 0.45 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of exercise was particularly linked to poor physical health, smoking was mainly linked to poor mental health and heavy alcohol consumption was associated with declines in both mental and physical health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the effects were apparent by the time the participants were in their mid-30s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Non-communicable diseases such as heart disease and cancer cause almost three-quarters of deaths worldwide,” says lead author Dr Tiia Kekäläinen, a health scientist who has a particular interest in aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But by following a healthy lifestyle, an individual can cut their risk of developing these illnesses and reduce their odds of an early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings highlight the importance of tackling risky health behaviours, such as smoking, heavy drinking and physical inactivity, as early as possible to prevent the damage they do to from building up over the years, culminating in poor mental and physical health later in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, it is never too late to change to healthier habits. Adopting healthier habits in midlife also has benefits for older age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors note that the study was observational and so couldn’t establish that the risky behaviours were fuelling ill health, rather than vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say that the relationship is likely two-way.  For example, someone who is stressed may drink heavily to help them cope.  This could then cause problems with family and friends that lead to poorer mental well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They add that the results are likely to apply to people born in Finland and other Western countries in late 1950s and in the 1960s.  However, they may not be as relevant to younger generations, owing to cultural and societal changes, and partly different risky behaviors occurring nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s limitations include rating each of the three habits as being equally damaging to health, instead of weighting them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors also acknowledge that they only looked at three types of behaviour and say that other factors, such as diet, should be included in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1162787c7e7f3f667462627e7f5165707f75773f727e3f647a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Simon Wesson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://tandf.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Taylor and Francis Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Simon Wesson – Taylor and Francis Group&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2025.2479233" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cumulative associations between health behaviours, mental well-being, and health over 30 years&lt;/a&gt;” by Tiia Kekäläinen et al. &lt;em&gt;Annals of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cumulative associations between health behaviours, mental well-being, and health over 30 years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e326"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the number of risky health behaviours and the duration of exposure to these behaviours over time may increase the risk of later adverse outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study examined cumulative associations of risky health behaviours with both positive and negative aspects of mental well-being and health. It has a uniquely long follow-up period of over 30 years, from early adulthood to the beginning of late adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e329"&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data were from the Jyväskylä Longitudinal Study of Personality and Social Development. The participants represent the Finnish age cohort born in 1959. This study utilized data collected at ages 27 (1986), 36 (1995), 42 (2001), 50 (2009), and 61 (2020–2021) (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 206–326).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk scores indicating the current number of risky behaviours of smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity and their temporal accumulation over time were calculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The associations of risk scores with mental well-being (depressive symptoms, psychological well-being) and health (self-rated health, number of metabolic risk factors) from age 36 onwards were analyzed with linear multilevel models adjusted for gender and education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e336"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;More current risky behaviours were associated with more depressive symptoms (&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; = 0.10, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.032), lower psychological well-being (&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; = -0.10, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.010), lower self-rated health (&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; = -0.45, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and more metabolic risk factors (&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; = 0.53, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.013).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The associations of temporal risk scores with the outcomes were even stronger (depressive symptoms: &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; = 0.38, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; psychological well-being: &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; = -0.15, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.046; self-rated health: &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; = -0.82, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; metabolic risk factors: &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; = 1.49, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among individual behaviours, the temporal risk score of alcohol consumption was negatively associated with most outcomes, while smoking was associated with poorer mental well-being and physical inactivity with poorer health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e390"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current and temporal accumulation of multiple risky health behaviours were associated with poorer mental well-being and health. Preventing these behaviours early in adulthood and midlife is crucial to avoid their accumulation and subsequent health risks.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 13:25:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5yOFA4Rm9yRjhZTFd5T0o1RHhXT3FuMzk1NExhYW9HOFJ1aWJYVUg3alhBRVlhU1FXSUh2YkFuR0NSTTU5ZUF1QVgybmdvcnN4YW8yMFZ6el84V1hmSkFrSmcybEdfOTQ3R1dCeFlQT0tCbXVU</guid></item><item><title>首批西雅图患者接受新的早期阿尔茨海默氏症药物-《西雅图时报》 | First Seattle patients receive new early Alzheimer’s drug - The Seattle Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPeFotZzExQ1htaVF6OV9KRkJlWlMwTWFlX0pnTlVQUGJLU2UtSFVLamZ3cEt5UUFxdEk1ckxKdnpWTmRLbFE3c1hLNzliWmFTeURmUW5jaVlzdDMxZllLNkFUd1BkSVBmaXc0ZWJCdG5lZXRTVkhOOFNhS2FpTDhKSlI2b0lLTjFBTXU0ZjlJV0ZYU1RBdUFqcmh1MURHWVNtb0VnSFdQbWVhUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPeFotZzExQ1htaVF6OV9KRkJlWlMwTWFlX0pnTlVQUGJLU2UtSFVLamZ3cEt5UUFxdEk1ckxKdnpWTmRLbFE3c1hLNzliWmFTeURmUW5jaVlzdDMxZllLNkFUd1BkSVBmaXc0ZWJCdG5lZXRTVkhOOFNhS2FpTDhKSlI2b0lLTjFBTXU0ZjlJV0ZYU1RBdUFqcmh1MURHWVNtb0VnSFdQbWVhUQ?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;First Seattle patients receive new early Alzheimer’s drug&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggJBVV95cUxPUEE4RlNWMVVBRk5TTXRqeWZzTHBPX3dhUzN2TUVjakJnUGlka05uMUcxQ2I5YXdnZTFETDJvc1dzbmx5eVVncXd3aEtoc3cwZVJQbGJGNTR3M3BkSUotSFRodWs0MW0yXzRzeXBBMUJ1ZmNiR2VySGZ5b0lyOGszcUZqVW5aVnY3ejNYOHJPQjh6MmtwdDdyOGRaUnltZjBNbTRSdTJrUnZoTTIzX0RmWTI2R3VkRUUwaVZ5cWswMFRvbkpWb05sUWFJVG1Mc1BSNFV5VlZCNHlKaWdiZmg3M3NYeGhVSUsxVFVVblJfSVQxbHlVVWk1c0lTM3FRSFl4Mnc?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;New drug gives hope and time to Alzheimer's patients&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;KOMO&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNbDhib3liRzVlVFZ0eW1TWkw0UlFSWWJrMVg3cUF2Sm8xUjVEcnBkamFnejc5X3ZweGsyLXFqUlhBNEtZS0NHY1g4ZG1CZThFYkVlMTlYRkhrNjY2dEJ0d2VGMUpUd3Vhd2dmMEI5NXR2SEF1UGgzM21SeWM3d25qSWJlWEtqRk9SMGRnSHhZNjVhRnJhM3YwUnBwQ0ZNdVpabjl2MGRyTlY?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;New treatments infuse hope for slowing Alzheimer’s progression&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;MercyOne&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX0FVX3lxTFB6TER3NWg5NGdzM2FlU0ZkZWluSm1tMGZ5NlNkTzUtdDNyb003dXpuZUZLeDM4ODNnWXhRODU3SW1JSGlPXzB5Q055OVZtbUVkc0FmRlZXc1I4SDlqQnRv?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;The future of Alzheimer’s treatment&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Nature&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxQSWZZTjJOM3JLQVR6SHNMV3JLYWxxNlZ2NjlEQVhhaU1DbzJwemtYNkRvdE5XNmQzQ0I5bld4aF85S0h1ZFNVdVNOUkJ2YXZjeGpMRlpMVUV6NkFSbl93MWMxZUZVX2xqcU10SHVYSUFPR0JHd2laaFRyNnI5M1pBMjNIMWZrU0JHQm9pdEQ4bVhwLUJOM2c?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Presentation of Alzheimer’s Disease in Clinical Practice&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Neurology live&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPeFotZzExQ1htaVF6OV9KRkJlWlMwTWFlX0pnTlVQUGJLU2UtSFVLamZ3cEt5UUFxdEk1ckxKdnpWTmRLbFE3c1hLNzliWmFTeURmUW5jaVlzdDMxZllLNkFUd1BkSVBmaXc0ZWJCdG5lZXRTVkhOOFNhS2FpTDhKSlI2b0lLTjFBTXU0ZjlJV0ZYU1RBdUFqcmh1MURHWVNtb0VnSFdQbWVhUQ</guid></item><item><title>科学家刚刚发现了降低癌症风险的最佳步骤-而且比您想象的要低- AOL.com | Scientists Just Discovered The Best Step Count For Slashing Cancer Risk—And It's Lower Than You Think - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE1UeTBjWEY5cXlHQWQ4aGQ4QWZLak9GZDkzbVdscUZ0TWlGX3lJZWlFdHg1b2lDWXlieFA2amgzSUhJdjBjR0dVUDgzS3ZJcnJrNHdFWW4xM1lSM3AxeF9QUzcyNk9xRmJuM1hhX0syWVF1TVBRQ1diZ2pNSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Your Step Count Can Influence Your Cancer Risk&lt;/span&gt;

The researchers also looked at the relationship between the daily averages and how likely the participants were to develop 13 types of cancer that are linked with physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After about six years, 2,633 people in the study had been diagnosed with one of those 13 types of cancer. But the researchers discovered that people with the highest amount of daily physical activity had a 26 percent lower risk of developing cancer than those who had the lowest amount of physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with higher daily step counts also had a lower risk of cancer, regardless of how fast they moved while being physically active. Those who took 7,000 steps a day had an 11 percent lower cancer risk compared to people who took 5,000 steps, while people who took 9,000 steps daily had a 16 percent lower risk. (After 9,000 steps, the risk decrease leveled off.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of exercise were people doing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers didn’t spell out &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a42803758/beginner-workout-plan/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:what type of exercise;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;what type of exercise&lt;/a&gt; the participants did. Instead, they looked at how intensely and how much participants moved on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that people who did light- and moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity every day had a lower risk of developing cancer compared to those who were more sedentary. But a range of movements can fall into that category, from walking and doing daily chores, to going for runs and doing &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g30985585/hiit-workout-at-home/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HIIT workouts.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;HIIT workouts. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/daily-physical-activity-even-light-intensities-linked-lower-cancer-risk#:~:text=In%20a%20prospective%20cohort%20study,cancer%20than%20individuals%20who%20were" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:suggest;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt; that people who aren’t that physically active can lower their cancer risk by incorporating more walking into their day, at any pace. “What’s especially promising is that this benefit wasn’t limited to intense exercise,” says &lt;a href="https://cph.osu.edu/people/benzo3" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Roberto M. Benzo, PhD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Roberto M.

(Inflammation is &lt;a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/conditions/inflammation" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tied;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;tied&lt;/a&gt; to a slew of serious health conditions, including cancer.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Regular movement also enhances the immune system, helping to improve the body’s ability to detect and destroy abnormal cells,” says &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/amy-k-bremner" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amy Bremner, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amy Bremner, MD&lt;/a&gt;, medical director of breast surgical oncology at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, if you’d prefer to have a step count goal to reach for, the study found that logging 9,000 steps a day was best for cancer prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the best ways to lower cancer risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors say it’s really important to consider what’s in your control when it comes to cancer risk. “You can’t control your genes, but some lifestyle factors will reduce your risk,” Dr. Jacoub says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recommends these lifestyle moves to tamp down on your risk of developing cancer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be active on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat a diet that’s lower in red meat and high in antioxidant-rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t smoke or stop smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limit how much alcohol you drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to limit your levels of stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay socially connected to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dr. Jacoub says that staying physically active is “unquestionably” important in lowering your cancer risk. And Benzo agrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every movement counts,” he says. “Even light, consistent activity—especially when it replaces sitting—can meaningfully reduce your cancer risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 12:52:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE1UeTBjWEY5cXlHQWQ4aGQ4QWZLak9GZDkzbVdscUZ0TWlGX3lJZWlFdHg1b2lDWXlieFA2amgzSUhJdjBjR0dVUDgzS3ZJcnJrNHdFWW4xM1lSM3AxeF9QUzcyNk9xRmJuM1hhX0syWVF1TVBRQ1diZ2pNSQ</guid></item><item><title>眼睛比我们想象的更快地揭示意图-神经科学新闻 | Eyes Reveal Intentions Faster Than We Think - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTFBjaEVUczMxMUNDU2p3QS1ORlB1MEc4ZXd2R3UyUVExRUdvVnNvR1Z6YU9jQmJTbEhHLUo2d2pMNDIzVjZvSF85MlZVRVBxV2JNRk1Cb1ZEc0ZQVVJSb3JiaDRCTzVydjVKeUJXVDhLbVhuZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Humans can detect another person’s intentions just by observing their eyes, even before any movement takes place. In experiments where participants watched video clips of people about to shift their gaze, viewers responded faster when the gaze was self-directed rather than instructed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that eye movements contain subtle cues about intention, which we’re wired to recognize instantly. The findings point to an evolved social mechanism that enables quick, non-verbal exchanges of complex information—potentially crucial in early human survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intention Detection:&lt;/strong&gt; Viewers identified eye movement direction faster when the person on screen chose where to look, indicating sensitivity to intent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subtle Motion Cues:&lt;/strong&gt; Freely chosen gaze shifts involved more eye-area movement, suggesting physical cues signal intentionality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evolutionary Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Eye-reading may have evolved to enable silent, efficient communication critical for survival.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;McGill University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;McGill researchers have demonstrated something long assumed: that glances can transmit information about one’s mental state to others without a single word being exchanged. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They speculate that this primal ability may have played a role in assuring survival of human society at times when making a sound could have attracted predators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109113"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gaze-communication-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gaze-communication-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gaze-communication-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gaze-communication-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gaze-communication-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gaze-communication-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gaze-communication-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gaze-communication-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two people looking at one another." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gaze-communication-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gaze-communication-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gaze-communication-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gaze-communication-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gaze-communication-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gaze-communication-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gaze-communication-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In other words, the observers were able to glean intentions in the eyes before any action had taken place. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Humans have a long history of living in complex groups and social situations. It has been theorized that this has led our brains to develop a heightened ability to focus on social cues from faces, and especially from eyes,&lt;strong&gt;”&lt;/strong&gt; said Jelena Ristic, a Professor in McGill’s psychology department. She has been working in the field for over 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a system that has evolved to support very quick exchanges of complex social information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Gaze-following is thought to provide a foundation for our social development and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It helps us to understand what others are thinking, looking or wanting, as well as to connect with them mentally, so we follow where others are looking quickly and spontaneously. Even young human infants and primates do it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Able to glean intentions by looking at eyes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ristic is the senior author on a research paper describing a series of seemingly simple experiments in which participants viewed videos in which people on screen looked either right or left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the subjects on screen had been instructed to look in one direction or the other, and other times they were allowed to choose where to look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Videos were paused just before the subjects moved their eyes, and the observers were asked to predict the direction that the subjects were going to look next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that when the people on screen were free to choose the direction of their gaze – what the researchers called “intentional looks” – the observers’ rate of accuracy was not affected. However, those who predicted correctly were able to do so more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the observers were able to glean intentions in the eyes before any action had taken place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The speed of the observers’ responses suggests that they implicitly recognize and respond more quickly to intentional eye movements. It also told us how sensitive we are to information about the mental state and intentions conveyed by the eyes,” said Florence Mayrand, a PhD candidate in the Department of Psychology and the paper’s first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characteristics of eye movements may provide clues about intentions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To try to understand why observers were able to guess eye-shift direction more quickly when people on screen had been left free to choose the direction in which they would look, the researchers analyzed the amount of motion available in the eye movement video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More movement was found in the area near the eyes right before the gaze shift when the gazers could choose freely where to look than when they had been told which way to look. This suggested to the investigators that intentional looks are marked by specific movement patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further understand whether intentional looks have any special physical properties to which people are inherently sensitive, the researchers are currently measuring the speed, trajectory, duration and the number of blinks and blink characteristics for intentional and directed looks in a new sample of study participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following this, they plan to examine whether these fundamental properties differ according to the intentions of the person looking in one direction or the other, for example, whether they are intending to deceive or help; how the ability to read intentions from eye gaze develops; what its underlying brain mechanisms are; and whether there any differences in sensitivity to intentions in gaze for groups with social difficulties, such as adults or children with autism or ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social Sciences and Humanities Council of Canada (SSHRC), Natural Science and Engineering Council of Canada (NSERC) and McGill University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this visual neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5c373d2834392e353239723b33313e3d251c313f3b353030723f3d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Katherine Gombay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mcgill.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;McGill University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Katherine Gombay – McGill University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44271-024-00137-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Intentional looks facilitate faster responding in observers&lt;/a&gt;” by Florence Mayrand et al. &lt;em&gt;Communications Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intentional looks facilitate faster responding in observers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans construct rich representations of other people’s mental states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we investigated how intentionality in eye gaze affected perception and responses to gaze. Observers viewed videos of human gazers looking left or right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to the observers, the gazers could either choose where to look (self-chosen gaze) or were explicitly instructed where to look (computer-instructed gaze).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Experiment 1, observers reported the direction of the gazer’s upcoming look before the eye movement was initiated. Faster responses were found for self-chosen relative to computer-instructed gaze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Experiments 2 and 3, observers responded by reporting the location of a peripheral target that appeared at the gazed-at or not gazed-at location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faster responses were found for gazed-at relative to not gazed-at targets and at longer cue-target intervals for self-chosen relative to computer-instructed gaze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The examination of the eye movement kinematics indicated that self-chosen gaze shifts were marked by a larger magnitude of motion within the eye region prior to the eye movement occurring relative to computer-instructed ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, perceived intentionality in eye gaze facilitates responses in observers with the information about mental states communicated via subtle properties of eye motion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 12:24:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTFBjaEVUczMxMUNDU2p3QS1ORlB1MEc4ZXd2R3UyUVExRUdvVnNvR1Z6YU9jQmJTbEhHLUo2d2pMNDIzVjZvSF85MlZVRVBxV2JNRk1Cb1ZEc0ZQVVJSb3JiaDRCTzVydjVKeUJXVDhLbVhuZw</guid></item><item><title>我是一名心脏病专家……以下是女性不应忽视的心脏病发作的微妙迹象--《每日邮报》 | I'm a cardiologist... here are the subtle signs of a heart attack women should NEVER ignore - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPREEzRGtRUzU3bE5QU2RrZmI5dWlSWnRpUk4wYUdfS2hPblEtRXVBZERPWEJYalZ0UVlNLV9EZEJmNjFEM19KdVdCbHJRWE4wSXBQNnlSS2VHRks4dzFCLWZKVVhpbjlQTWdSbWcxZUhOblR2YkZtd2Y1TUF4YlNpWGgxWl80WERMNW4tczlfdTNNRWFrSTNkampyTmEzSmtKOEZr0gGoAUFVX3lxTFB5MFg2LXhhUmYxZ2pZeFB0OW8xam5SVW5tV2gweEliRnRJSGlWZ3dGTWp4bm5sQ1F4d0FZYzQ0cHdmUDBPYnZ1QU11allYZXBxZG5FamlLVnByVTEtSnZIM0Z2ZXpjRmUwZ3JzTTF0WXVBQ3czMUlvMGltT0Rac1FTSlJnOFctS293MmhlbjNOTGtfN0xzU1BlNzBUaUJqN2MxOG5QdU5jZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whether it was from school, TV, or that scene in Four Weddings and a Funeral, you're probably well-versed in the symptoms of a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You know the ones: pain in your left arm and heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Or so you thought. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because a lot of what we know about science and health are based on the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://genderedinnovations.stanford.edu/methods/standards.html"&gt;bodies of white, able-bodied men&lt;/a&gt;, often anyone who doesn't fit this description is left out of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And this includes women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So because you've been conditioned to recognize the symptoms of a man, you probably wouldn't recognize if you were having a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, interventional cardiologist and chief medical officer at Vital Solution Dr. Bradley Serwer told DailyMail.com that women don't even always have chest pain when they're having a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Instead, they may experience shortness of breath, nausea, indigestion, or upper abdominal pain, dizziness or passing out,' Dr. Serwer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Women don't always experience a pain in their chest when they're having a heart attack (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And it's because of this difference in symptoms that a diagnosis can be delayed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can have fatal repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Though heart disease remains the leading cause of death for women in the United States, they tend to present with it seven to 10 years later in life compared to men,' Dr. Serwer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Due to the under recognition of heart disease in women, studies have indicated that they receive less aggressive treatment.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So what other heart attack symptoms are women potentially missing out on? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Serwer said that jaw pain can be an indication, especially if they commence during moderate exercise and then subside when you rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;He also said that pain primarily located on the left side of the jaw, especially when accompanied by the absence of redness or swelling in the jaw, can be a signal that your pain is being caused by something more severe than you thought. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And the idea that a shooting pain is a sign you're having a heart attack isn't totally off. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Because women's heart attack symptoms are less recognized, they often get less aggressive treatment than men do (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you feel pain in your neck and arm - any arm - this could be the symptom of a heart attack.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And if you're having any sort of shortness of breath, perspiration, or clammy skin followed by pain, you might want to get to a doctor immediately. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The pain should be taken more seriously if you have significant cardiac risk factors, such as a smoking history, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or a strong family history of coronary artery disease,' Dr. Serwer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whether you've experienced this symptoms before or they're showing up out of nowhere, it's always better to be safe than sorry - especially when it comes to your heart.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

However, when he went to the doctor, “they took some urine samples and gave me some antibiotics,” he said, according to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/23/health/i-thought-i-had-a-uti-instead-it-was-stage-4-bladder-cancer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The New York Post. ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Post. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The symptoms, he said, “went away for a while,” but came back a few months later. Cotton, who hails from the English town of Sandbach, explained that he did “all sorts” of things to treat what he thought was a UTI: “I would drink &lt;a href="https://people.com/health/cranberries-help-urinary-tract-infections-ob-gyn-debunks/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cranberry juice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;cranberry juice&lt;/a&gt;, thinking that would flush through whatever was causing the pain, but that didn’t have much of an effect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people.com/christian-radio-host-rob-dempsey-dead-8733831" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Christian Radio Host Rob Dempsey Dies a Week After Announcing Cancer Diagnosis: 'He Was a Great Man';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Christian Radio Host Rob Dempsey Dies a Week After Announcing Cancer Diagnosis: 'He Was a Great Man'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Cotton/SWNS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chris Cotton (left) and his wife Hannah&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But after repeated visits back to the doctor, in January 2024, the civil service worker was told he had invasive bladder cancer after doctors removed a tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I prepared myself that it could be cancer.

Scientists have been studying creatine since the 1830s and, for more than a century, we have known that it was pivotal for producing energy in our muscles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That, as anybody who was alive in the ’90s may remember, is how creatine first exploded as a consumer product. Swedish researchers &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1327657/"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; influential research in 1992 demonstrating creatine supplementation’s effectiveness in improving stamina and recovery during the short bursts of physical exercise. It didn’t take long after that for creatine supplements to hit the shelves of drugstores and workout gyms nationwide. And it was popular. Not only was it cheap — a 10-ounce jar of creatine costs $17 on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NUTRITION-Micronized-Creatine-Monohydrate-Unflavored/dp/B002DYIZEE?th=1"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; — but it was also an easy way for bodybuilders and exercise enthusiasts to improve their performance. Today, as many as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8401943/"&gt;one in four adults&lt;/a&gt; say they have used creatine; &lt;a href="https://www.sportsmedtoday.com/creatine-va-206.htm#:~:text=Creatine%20is%20the%20most%20popular,11th%20and%2012th%20graders%20athletes."&gt;$400 million worth of it&lt;/a&gt; is sold in the US every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And this was a supplement that really worked: A 2018 meta-analysis of the available research concluded that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6090881/"&gt;creatine is “the most effective nutritional supplement&lt;/a&gt; available to athletes to increase high intensity exercise capacity and muscle mass during training.” Across years of studies, no dangerous side effects have been detected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But the most surprising use of creatine supplements is in a setting that could not be further from the image of jacked-up bodybuilders pumping iron: treating depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the early 2000s, scientists established creatine’s importance not only for muscle use but also for brain function. The compound &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3340488/"&gt;helps&lt;/a&gt; your brain to convert nutrients into energy and scientists concluded that poor metabolism could help to explain various psychiatric disorders, including depression. In layman’s terms, if your brain wasn’t processing energy efficiently, it could have these negative side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If that were true, it would follow that more creatine could improve a person’s brain metabolism and thereby ease their depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A decade ago, the first clinical trials began testing whether creatine supplements improved depression among people who were also receiving antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy. The results have been impressive: A 2024 meta-review concluded that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11567172/"&gt;creatine had proven its effectiveness&lt;/a&gt; in supplementing those other treatments, leading people to feel better more quickly and be less likely to experience depression again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Now comes a new study, out of India, suggesting creatine could be helpful in treating depression without antidepressants being involved — a preliminary but potentially important finding as we search for cheaper and easier ways to provide help to more people who need it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="a-fascinating-new-creatine-depression-study-in-india" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;A fascinating new creatine depression study in India&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The study, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924977X24007405?via%3Dihub#sec0002"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, was tiny and flew under the radar: 100 participants, in Dehradun, a city of 800,000 in India’s far north. Lead researcher Nima Norbu Sherpa of Glasgow Caledonian University received a grant from an India-based charity, the Universal Human Rights and Social Development Association, to run the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The setting is telling: Part of creatine’s appeal in mental health treatment is not only its potential efficacy but also that it’s cheap and doesn’t require a professional clinician; patients can take it on their own. That made Dehradun, a developing city with a lot of low-income patients and relatively few mental health clinicians, a logical place to test whether creatine could improve people’s well-being without antidepressants, said Riccardo De Giorgi, a clinical lecturer in psychiatry at Oxford and co-author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The 100 participants, recruited from the city and small surrounding villages, were split into two groups. Both groups took part in talk therapy sessions. One group also received 5 milligrams of creatine every day, while the other got a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;After eight weeks, both groups were improving — cognitive behavioral therapy itself is, of course, a well-attested treatment for depression. But the patients who took creatine on top of their therapy were doing better still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The participants answered a nine-question survey at the beginning of the study, which provided a one-number score of the severity of their depression symptoms. People in both groups started a little below 18 on average, indicating moderately severe depression. At the end of the study, the patients taking creatine reported a score of 5 on average, while the control group registered at 11. Eleven people who were taking creatine throughout the study reported going into remission, meaning they could effectively return to normal life; only five people taking placebos said the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Both groups had about 20 people discontinue their treatment — not uncommon for people with depression, the authors noted. The reported side effects for people taking creatine were mild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It is an eye-catching result, even as De Giorgi emphasized repeatedly that the findings were “incremental and preliminary.” The inevitably sensational nature of the finding — a bodybuilder supplement can help with depression? — warrants being clear and cautious in how we interpret the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Previous sensationalist messages in this research area, e.g., creatine, physical exercise, keto diet, have caused more harm to the science than benefit,’” De Giorgi told me over email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For one, the high dropout rate is reason for skepticism about the precise size of creatine’s effect. More research that replicates the same results is needed before we can be confident that creatine plus therapy is a winning combination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But it’s an area of research worth watching. Peter Attia, a physician who writes about longevity and health enhancement and was not involved with the study, &lt;a href="https://peterattiamd.com/creatine-and-depression/?utm_source=weekly-newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=250406-NL-/creatineanddepression&amp;amp;utm_content=250406-NL-/creatineanddepression-email-subs&amp;amp;utm_source=Peter+Attia&amp;amp;utm_campaign=fa3017be8a-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_01_18_12_06_COPY_01&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_-d5206691b8-106237662&amp;amp;mc_cid=fa3017be8a"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in covering the study’s findings that “since many people already use creatine as part of their supplement routine, it could be an easy addition for those looking to improve mental health without major lifestyle changes.” Its affordability and ubiquity could also make it appealing for people with fewer resources, like those who participated in the India study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;He did, however, also caution that more evidence would be necessary before we can figure out whether and how creatine fits into “the therapeutic toolbox.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As we grapple with &lt;a href="https://www.projecthope.org/news-stories/story/the-global-mental-health-crisis-10-numbers-to-note/"&gt;a global mental health crisis&lt;/a&gt;, we need all of the tools we can find.

If we really have an alternative as cheap and available as creatine, it could make a real difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxNa0V2QkZKRzdPaG1qcHhwd1czM0E1VFJMQ0JrLTl6ODJsMXFpZnk1M2dlZ1VYdEdLRjIyT2VBblJiLVdRR1JQSkRiRlFwQ3Z3YnU0MUhwcmo1dnFFelR5V2xTSWVnUktDQ19aSmoyUTBBa1FTNUJEWC11UVJnRC1ENU9DWVJvX1ZKU1N0SGZkVHZhaHgweTdrd3ZzVQ</guid></item><item><title>科学家刚刚发现了降低癌症风险的最佳步骤-而且比你想象的要低-女性健康 | Scientists Just Discovered The Best Step Count For Slashing Cancer Risk—And It's Lower Than You Think - Women's Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxQa2p0cHlZc0hSTmlEMU1YZWJRVUU0TVNsbGlCeW9ZOXB2ZTNkcVFmNDNybHVfSWRmcGtpR2lqZlNWSFJ0SUpRV1VyektuQTBrZFRtd3QtUEgtTnZ5MVFqMG1VVFU3cXdyOWd6YTV1XzRvVG5MbF9qaWxFVS1DRHk5cGs0cFlSMEhBXzZzTmIxbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-j4k1z9 et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="0" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;You can’t do a thing about the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19133613/23andme-breast-cancer-test/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19133613/23andme-breast-cancer-test/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="genes" data-node-id="0.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;genes&lt;/a&gt; you inherit from your parents, but doctors have stressed for decades that there are &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63785689/yogurt-colorectal-cancer-study/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63785689/yogurt-colorectal-cancer-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="certain lifestyle tweaks" data-node-id="0.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;certain lifestyle tweaks&lt;/a&gt; you can make to help lower your risk of developing cancer.

The researchers also looked at the relationship between the daily averages and how likely the participants were to develop 13 types of cancer that are linked with physical activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;After about six years, 2,633 people in the study had been diagnosed with one of those 13 types of cancer.

Kennedy Jr’s recent comments about autism have reignited debates on the topic, with the US Health Secretary labelling the disorder an ‘epidemic’ with a greater impact than Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He’s far from the first person to use such terminology to describe what is happening with autism diagnoses and, actually, he’s not entirely wrong about the scale of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he is wrong about what’s truly driving skyrocketing numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since 1998, there has been a 787 per cent increase in autism diagnoses in the UK. There &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; an epidemic – not of autism itself, but of positive diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-91b6c3b0-21d5-11f0-b6f3-29522c2df646"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; estimates one in 31 children now has autism compared to one in 56 a decade ago. Previous studies suggested prevalence was as low as one in 5,000 in the 1960s and 1970s.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr has suggested previously that the rise in autism is linked to vaccines. The real question we should be asking is not what the cause of the disorder is but, instead, what is contributing to out-of-control diagnosis rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2025, many organisations are reporting diagnosis rates well above 80 per cent, meaning that for every ten people who walk through the clinic door, eight get a diagnosis. This raises serious concerns, as not everyone can have autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr has called autism an 'epidemic' and blamed the rise in diagnoses on vaccines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Autism isn’t suddenly more prevalent because more people are being born with it, or because we have ‘greater awareness’ of the symptoms – it’s mostly down to a dramatic rise in misdiagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This has been fuelled by multiple factors, such as the use of unreliable online methods to diagnose and a distressed society that is struggling to cope without diagnosis or labelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;We also see the erroneous application of genuine clinical concepts such as ‘autistic masking’. This is a strategy used by people with autism to cover up or camouflage the communication difficulties they experience, helping them ‘fit in’. For instance, people with autism may pretend to be ‘normal' in social situations – by reducing their fidgeting, not revealing their intense interests, or rehearsing what they will say, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;We are seeing this characteristic being misused to justify giving diagnoses to people who do not have symptoms of autism – but who, for example, might be socially awkward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another factor in the rise of diagnosis rates is that assessments are being carried out by people without the necessary qualifications and experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Psychiatrists, paediatricians and psychologists are trained to complete diagnostic work, holding doctoral-level qualifications and working under statutory professional regulation to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet we are increasingly seeing other practitioners giving diagnoses – cognitive behavioural therapists, teachers, assistant psychologists and social workers – who are simply not qualified to perform these assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Lisa Williams is a clinical psychologist and founder of The Autism Service&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Autism diagnosis has become a lucrative commercial opportunity, thanks to many people looking to explain their difficulties via diagnosis. The NHS is now outsourcing millions of pounds worth of assessments per year to the private sector, with many providers prioritising profit over quality. (With an absence of complaint – because too often the diagnosis sought is the diagnosis gained.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Autism is very real, but the system designed to support those with the disorder is buckling under the sheer number of people receiving a diagnosis, diverting care from those the service was ring-fenced for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What is needed is better gatekeeping of referrals, not more diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Globally, there needs to be a shift in focus, away from outdated questions about causes and cures, and instead towards addressing the urgent problem of misdiagnosis, the integrity of diagnostic practices, and society’s requirement for labels for everything we experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Long-term, the consequences of this could prove catastrophic for autistic people who rely on the support systems that are likely to collapse if action is not taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Lisa Williams is a clinical psychologist and founder of The Autism Service, a network of private clinics in England and Wales.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 10:45:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxPdlBNTGRXRDZPOGprNkpJVUNXZ2lJbUFLSnBLU3hRX1paMWc3TnlKQ3RPREkySjdmd2lRN09ZVTdWWTVaZVM3Tjc3MUpDOWtpOVQ5VlFWM242OGZteGpQMkRkZTJKdWt2QUlubGhwU193LUx2dE1waTd0d2hEWW5rdXllS1NoNjhRdk9fWjlIYWRnOXVUTVd0bVNYMzRGZVdQNFNzaVBZOWhLYmVZRnFfMDhB</guid></item><item><title>肠道细菌的损伤可能在年轻人结肠癌的增加中发挥作用- NPR | Damage from gut bacteria may play a role in the rise in colon cancer in young adults - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxONVZNZ00ydk9yVFBwZHBFNHg4dDJUYldEZDFMdFVzZHdEVlpEZDFTT0JwOWRVdHB4a1RnTlFMVmhUajFRZWVfUWlYWDRVbXVrTFltRGFmU01kc2drQVpqYnY4SlNwajBybEszT2RxUnpfZnRfdlNYSENLVm12aVpxMk9lX0J1N0JZc1ltNGVLUWZiTGJ0SkxFaDNyeDhFWVZJd3ZuT1NINWE5NFFFblE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                Escherichia coli or E. coli is a part of family of bacteria that are commonly found in the human gut. Scientists found that a toxin the bacteria release is linked to some cases of colorectal cancer.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;It's unclear why colon cancer cases &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures-2023.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;have doubled&lt;/a&gt; in people under 55 over the past two decades, a staggering rise that has alarmed doctors and cancer researchers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But part of the story could be colibactin, a toxin made by certain strains of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; and other bacteria. In a study out this week, researchers have identified a strong link between this DNA-damaging toxin and colon cancer among younger patients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team, based at the University of California, San Diego, analyzed tissue samples from close to 1,000 colorectal cancer patients across four continents. They found the majority had cancers bearing mutations that signaled a past encounter with colibactin.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"You can think of it as the weapon system of a bacteria to fight other bacteria and to defend themselves," says &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;q=Ludmil+Alexandrov&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8" target="_blank"&gt;Ludmil Alexandrov&lt;/a&gt;, the lead author of the study, which &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09025-8" target="_blank"&gt;was published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; this week.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Strikingly, those under the age of 40 with early-onset colon cancer were three to five times more likely to have these mutations than those in their 70s and older.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The thinking goes that in some people, this bacterial weaponry — technically called a "genotoxin" — can get directed at their gut cells, seeding mutations that put them at increased risk of developing colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to their data, this exposure isn't ongoing when the cancer is diagnosed. Instead, it appears to have happened during childhood.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Our estimate is that it happens within the first 10 years of life," Alexandrov says. "So if you get that mutation at age 5, that puts you 20 to 30 years ahead of schedule for getting colorectal cancer."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the study shows a strong association, the data can't prove colibactin &lt;em&gt;caused&lt;/em&gt; these patients to develop cancer at a younger age. And researchers in the field don't expect &lt;em&gt;E. coli,&lt;/em&gt; or any single microbe for that matter, to be the skeleton key for the surge in colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"That would be too simple,"&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;says &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;q=Christian+Jobin%2C&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8" target="_blank"&gt;Christian Jobin&lt;/a&gt;, a microbiome researcher at the University of Florida.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More likely, he says, colibactin — studied closely in &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;but produced by other bacteria, too &lt;em&gt;— &lt;/em&gt;is one "hit" among many to our microbiome, which together may place some people on a faster trajectory for developing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;What triggers a DNA-damaging toxin&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study is a new clue into the rise in colorectal cancer in the young. Scientists believe some confluence of environmental factors, including diet, a sedentary lifestyle, medication and so on, is driving this steep rise. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These could be having downstream effects on the microbes in our gut like &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's been really perplexing," says &lt;a href="https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/dey-neelendu.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Neelendu Dey&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist whose lab focuses on the gut microbiome at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. "The microbes that may contribute to cancer risk are tricky to understand."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The family of microbes to which &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; belongs is actually the most prevalent type of bacteria in your gut during the very early stages of life. In other words, it's not some new infectious agent that needs to be eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;About 20% to 30% of people have strains of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; that can synthesize this toxin, but that doesn't mean it's necessarily having "deleterious effects," says Jobin, whose lab has pioneered related research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Adding to the puzzle: Not everyone with colorectal cancer has these signatures of colibactin-related mutations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's something provoking the bacteria to behave this way, perhaps giving it an advantage to grow in more abundance. "What triggers this weapon or the deployment?" Jobin says. "We don't know but we have to consider the environment."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We know that some of these &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; that produce colibactin are influenced by diet, inflammation, and medication," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Jobin says the new research is "fantastic" because it bridges early preclinical research in animals with "real life humans," and opens new avenues for research.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Studies conducted on animals have shown colibactin exposure can drive cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, deleting the genetic region responsible for producing this toxin in &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; can actually incapacitate the bacteria from promoting cancer in animals. Feeding the animals more or less fiber can affect tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Antibiotics use and nutrition, could be at play&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because they sequenced the genome of cancer from patients all over the globe, Alexandrov says the researchers&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;could tell these mutations related to colibactin are actually quite rare in more "rural, non-industrialized" regions of Africa and Asia, whereas they turn up more frequently in the U.S. and Western Europe.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;That evidence, coupled with the findings that it's a result of early childhood exposure, gives them a handful of hypotheses about what could be at play.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says some of their top suspects are the mode of birth (cesarean section vs. vaginal delivery), breastfeeding, the use of antibiotics and nutrition, for example whether children were &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/05/25/1178163270/ultra-processed-foods-health-risk-weight-gain" target="_blank"&gt;fed ultra processed foods.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;All of these factors are known to substantially affect the microbiome and there is some evidence they may impact this [colibactin producing] bacteria, but we really need to investigate each one carefully."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dey views all of these as plausible, particularly antibiotics, given that other research teams &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37504220/" target="_blank"&gt;have linked early-life antibiotic use&lt;/a&gt; to increased risk of colorectal cancer later on.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More broadly, he says he hopes researchers can eventually find microbes that serve as "biomarkers" for identifying people at risk of developing pre-cancers. And, perhaps down the line, drugs can be designed to target toxins like colibactin to counter their harmful effects.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;Of course, it sounds simple, but we have to acknowledge the ecological lessons learned in other contexts," he says. "When you try to take out, or introduce a species, it can have effects that you didn't anticipate, so this all needs to be done very thoughtfully."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists have gotten one step closer to growing replacement teeth in the lab — a development that could pave the way for new alternatives to unpleasant dental fillings and root canals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team developed a special material that allows cells to communicate with one another just as they would in the body, therefore enabling them to develop into tooth cells, the researchers reported in a study published in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsmacrolett.4c00520" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsmacrolett.4c00520" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ACS Macro Letters&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process allows scientists to grow teeth from a patient's cells in the lab. Someday, it could enable damaged or infected teeth to be replaced by real teeth, rather than being repaired using fillings and other dental procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans typically grow two sets of teeth in their lifetime: Around 20 baby teeth start coming in at around &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11179-teething-teething-syndrome" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11179-teething-teething-syndrome" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;6 months&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of age and are then gradually replaced by 32 adult teeth starting at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sheffieldchildrens.nhs.uk/patients-and-parents/looking-after-your-teeth/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sheffieldchildrens.nhs.uk/patients-and-parents/looking-after-your-teeth/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;about age 6&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some animals, like sharks or crocodiles, can constantly replace missing teeth, but humans are limited to these two sets. This is because animals that can keep replacing their teeth never lose the tooth stem cells that allow them to constantly grow new teeth. Humans, by contrast, don't retain these active regenerative cells after &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://royalsociety.org/news/2014/sse-adult-stem-cells/" target="_blank" data-url="https://royalsociety.org/news/2014/sse-adult-stem-cells/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;adult teeth come through&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When our teeth are damaged, dentists mend cavities with fillings or replace teeth with artificial tooth implants. However, these solutions cannot repair themselves and may need to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fillings aren't the best solution for repairing teeth," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/xuechen-zhang" target="_blank" data-url="https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/xuechen-zhang" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Xuechen Zhang&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at King's College London, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/lab-grown-teeth-might-become-an-alternative-to-fillings-following-research-breakthrough" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/lab-grown-teeth-might-become-an-alternative-to-fillings-following-research-breakthrough" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;said in a statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Teeth begin &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3000521/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3000521/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;growing from stem cells&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; during early embryonic development, with stem cells from different types of embryonic tissue "talking" to each other using signaling molecules to trigger tooth formation. The stem cells differentiate into various forms of cells, which then secrete the materials that the tooth is eventually made from, such as enamel, dentin and cementum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the researchers described how they made a crucial breakthrough by developing a material that allowed the stem cells to communicate as they would in the body. The material was made from hydrogel — a soft, gel-like material that can absorb large amounts of water — and emulates the environment around the cells in the body, known as the matrix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This meant that when we introduced the cultured cells, they were able to send signals to each other to start the tooth formation process," Zhang said. "Previous attempts had failed, as all the signals were sent in one go. This new material releases signals slowly over time, replicating what happens in the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;A researcher holding a normal tooth. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: King's College London)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such tooth replacements would be longer-lasting, stronger and much less likely to be rejected by the body, which occurs in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/dental-implant-problems" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.healthline.com/health/dental-implant-problems" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;between 5 and 10%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of tooth implants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lab-grown teeth would naturally regenerate, integrating into the jaw as real teeth," Zhang explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are still far from implanting a replacement tooth into a human patient. Right now, they're working to figure out the best way for a tooth to be introduced into the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have different ideas to put the teeth inside the mouth," Zhang said. "We could transplant the young tooth cells at the location of the missing tooth and let them grow inside [the] mouth. Alternatively, we could create the whole tooth in the lab before placing it in the patient’s mouth. For both options, we need to start the very early tooth development process in the lab."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, the development could pave the way for new alternatives to fillings and implants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As the field progresses, the integration of such innovative techniques holds the potential to revolutionise dental care, offering sustainable and effective solutions for tooth repair and regeneration," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/ana-angelova-volponi" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/ana-angelova-volponi" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ana Angelova Volponi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at King's College London, said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;

Getting quality sleep — the kind that leaves you feeling refreshed and ready for the day — is critical for a healthy brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;People with disturbed sleep, like insomnia or sleep apnea, have a &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079217300114" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/well/mind/sleep-dementia.html" title=""&gt;developing dementia&lt;/a&gt; than those with no sleep issues. Poor sleep can harm your brain in other ways, too. &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000208056" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; found that people in their 30s and 40s with heavily disrupted sleep (such as frequent awakenings or movements) were two to three times more likely to test lower in executive function, working memory and processing speeds a decade or so later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Scientists think that deep sleep and rapid eye movement (or REM) sleep are particularly influential when it comes to brain health and dementia risk. A &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40110600/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;study published last month&lt;/a&gt; on people with deep sleep and REM deficiencies found that the subjects’ brains showed signs of atrophy in M.R.I. scans 13 to 17 years after the deficiencies were observed; the atrophy looked similar to what you’d find in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-537baae6"&gt;What Scientists Know So Far&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;When you’re asleep, your brain continuously cycles through four distinct phases: Two stages of lighter sleep, when your body relaxes and your heart rate and temperature drop; deep sleep or slow wave sleep, when brain activity slows; and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/25/well/mind/rem-sleep-benefits.html" title=""&gt;REM&lt;/a&gt;, when you typically dream. The brain generally takes about 90 minutes to cycle through all four stages and then restarts the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Deep sleep and REM help your brain “heal itself” from fatigue and stress and consolidate memories, said Matthew Pase, an associate professor at the School of Psychological Sciences at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. In deep sleep, your brain regulates metabolism and hormones; it also acts as a “rinse” for the brain, clearing out waste. REM is when your brain processes emotions and new information you picked up when you were awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The two phases influence dementia risk in different ways, scientists think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;As part of the rinsing process in deep sleep, your brain flushes out amyloid proteins that are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s. Years of interrupted deep sleep and incomplete flushing — known as &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8186542/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;glymphatic failure&lt;/a&gt; — could hasten the onset of dementia, said Dr. Maiken Nedergaard, a neurology professor at the University of Rochester Medical Center who researches the glymphatic system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s even more important if you didn’t hydrate well the day before. “If you didn’t drink enough water the day before, you might &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8064290/how-to-tell-if-you-are-dehydrated/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;wake up dehydrated&lt;/a&gt;,” says Roberts-Davis.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Drinking water first thing can help your body wake up and start your day feeling good,” says Roberts-Davis. Studies show that hydration is closely linked with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-doctors-do-every-day-for-better-brain-health-11678638" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;. For example, one study found that participants with a lower hydration status also had a greater decline in their cognitive function over a two-year period.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the many functions of fluids is promoting healthy digestion. Your body needs fluids to soften stool and make it easier to pass. It works hand-in-hand with fiber to do just that. Especially if you &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7911394/the-fastest-way-to-relieve-constipation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;struggle with constipation&lt;/a&gt;, you may notice digestive benefits from adding a glass of water to your morning routine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Hydration helps ensure proper kidney function and aids in preventing kidney stones,” says &lt;a href="https://theeverydaykidneycook.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Beverly Garden, RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;. Your kidneys need water to remove waste through your urine. If there’s too little water, the waste may collect in your blood and be unable to reach your kidneys. It’s also more likely that certain substances will crystallize in your kidneys, forming kidney stones.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, studies show that drinking more fluids is linked with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-eat-to-prevent-kidney-stones-11705389" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduced risk of kidney stones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking water in the morning may also help &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-lower-blood-pressure-8611460" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;. One study examined the benefits of adding about 18 ounces of water upon waking and another 18 ounces before bed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It found that this hydration regimen (which added up to about 2 liters of total fluid per day) led to a decrease in blood pressure. Why? Drinking more water helps remove excess sodium, alters hormones involved in blood pressure management and makes it easier for blood to flow through your blood vessels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even if it seems simple, we know that it’s not always easy to adopt a new healthy habit. Dietitians shared a few easy strategies for improving your morning hydration:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep Water on Your Nightstand: &lt;/strong&gt;“Keep water handy at your bedside. Then, drink 8 to 16 ounces right away before even getting out of bed,” suggests Garden. This can help you remember to hydrate before you get busy preparing for your day. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair It with Another Habit:&lt;/strong&gt; Pairing a new habit with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7906041/things-you-should-do-before-8-am-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;an existing one&lt;/a&gt; may make it easier to adopt, like pairing a glass of water with your morning medications or supplements. “Many pills actually require a full glass of water to be absorbed properly in the body. By drinking a full glass when you wake up, you are aiding in your daily water intake as well,” says &lt;a href="https://www.arugalyssa.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alyssa Smolen, M.S., RDN, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, a media and community dietitian. Don’t take pills in the morning? Challenge yourself to finish a glass of water before your coffee brews, or sip on herbal tea as you read the morning news.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Overlook Other Sources of Hydration:&lt;/strong&gt; “Whether it’s hot tea, a green smoothie or a tall glass of water, starting your morning strong with hydration is key,” says Hardy. Notice that it doesn’t only have to be water. Incorporating &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-no-added-sugar-drinks-to-hydrate-8675270" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;other drinks&lt;/a&gt;, like herbal tea or smoothies, into your morning can help hydrate you at the start of your day. Also keep in mind that incorporating water-rich foods at breakfast also counts toward your hydration needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adopting healthy morning habits doesn’t have to be time-consuming. In fact, dietitians agree that the healthiest habit to start before 9 a.m. is simply hydrating. Starting your day off with a glass of water may counter nighttime dehydration, promote alertness, support healthy digestion and blood pressure and lower your risk of kidney stones. If you don’t love water, try a smoothie or a cup of herbal tea. To meet your overall fluid needs, be sure to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-way-to-stay-hydrated-ally-love-interview-8702860" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;keep your hydration up&lt;/a&gt; throughout the rest of the day, too!

Born on July 28, 1953, in Escanaba, to Jane and Percy Rosemurgy, his journey from the shores of Lake Michigan to the forefront of surgical innovation was marked by brilliance, compassion, and an unwavering commitment to improving the lives of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p402_premium"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up in Escanaba, Alex excelled both academically and athletically. He proudly played football and basketball at Escanaba High School — a testament to his dedication and skill — which later led to his induction into the school’s Athletic Hall of Fame. It was during these formative years that he met Kathy Boyle, a fellow student who would become the love of his life. He graduated in 1971, leaving behind a legacy of teamwork and sportsmanship and carrying with him the beginnings of a lifelong romance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driven by a thirst for knowledge and a desire to serve, Alex pursued higher education with unwavering focus. He attended the University of Wisconsin, where he was inducted into the Iron Cross Society — an honor reserved for the top students of the senior class. He continued on to the University of Michigan Medical School, then completed his surgical residency at the University of Chicago, spending several formative years studying intestinal physiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 16, 1979, Alex married his high school sweetheart, Kathy Boyle. Their bond was a source of immense joy and strength throughout his life. He often said that marrying Kathy was the best decision he ever made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1984, Tampa became their adopted home. There, Dr. Rosemurgy flourished at the University of South Florida (USF) and Tampa General Hospital. Over his distinguished career, he held numerous prestigious roles, including Professor of Surgery, Professor of Medicine, and Associate Dean for Academic Enrichment. He was also the proud recipient of the Reeves/Culverhouse Endowed Chair in Digestive Disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More important than any title, Alex was a healer. He saved countless lives and extended many more, always approaching each patient with skill, care, and compassion. His mastery in surgery, particularly in the treatment of digestive disorders and pancreatic cancer, was unmatched. A pioneer in his field, he embraced robotic surgery and built one of the nation’s most respected programs for robotic liver and pancreatic procedures. Over the course of his career, he performed tens of thousands of operations, offering hope where it was often in short supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the operating room, Dr. Rosemurgy was a passionate educator and mentor. He trained generations of surgical residents — many of whom have gone on to distinguished careers of their own — and led research programs that introduced countless students to the field of medicine. His commitment to advancing knowledge lives on through the more than 400 academic papers he authored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rosemurgy’s legacy in medicine will echo for generations through the hands of those he trained, the research he contributed, and, most importantly, the patients whose lives he touched. Yet, his greatest joy was not found in accolades or achievements — it was in the life he shared with Kathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is survived by his beloved wife, Kathy Rosemurgy; his children, Percy Rosemurgy (Fatima), Stephanie More (Copeland), Elizabeth Wood (Robert), and Carolyn McKinley (Max); his siblings, Bob Rosemurgy, Jim Rosemurgy, Cilla Harris, and Patty Juul; and his cherished grandchildren, Lillian More, Margaret More, R.J. Wood, Annabelle Wood, Andrew McKinley, Maia Rosemurgy, Rashida Rosemurgy, and Matthew McKinley. He is also remembered fondly by a host of relatives, friends, colleagues, and patients who will forever miss his brilliance, dedication, gentle spirit, and boundless love for his family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A memorial service to celebrate Dr. Alexander S. Rosemurgy’s life will be held at Palma Ceia Presbyterian Church (3501 W. San Jose St., Tampa, FL 33629) on Thursday, May 1, 2025, at 4 p.m., with a reception to follow at The Hyde House (1646 W. Snow Ave., Tampa, FL 33606). In lieu of flowers, the family requests that a collection be made and donated in his name to the Escanaba High School Athletic Department. Checks can be sent to Percy Rosemurgy at 3311 Cheviot Dr, Tampa, FL 33618 and made out to Percy Rosemurgy or sent via Venmo to @Percy-Rosemurgy.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP1) receptor agonists — the powerful ingredients behind Wegovy and  Ozempic — have long been hailed a monumental breakthrough in the war on obesity and type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In March, an &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14482729/weight-loss-jabs-triple-risk-depression-suicide-alarming-effect.html"&gt;eight-year long study&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;span&gt;160,000 obese patients found those taking the drugs had nearly treble the normal risk of depression and double the risk of anxiety, as well as three times the risk of suicidal behaviour, compared with people who weren't on the drugs. &lt;/span&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest analysis, led by 24 researchers across the United States, Brazil, Iran, and Israel, found long-term use of these drugs could disrupt signals sent by dopamine in the brain, potentially leading to depressive symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commonly referred to as the happiness hormone, dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in the brain's pleasure and reward systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the paper, published in the journal Current Neuropharmacology, scientists examined the DNA of individuals with hypodopaminergia - a condition characterised by reduced dopamine activity in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using computer simulation software, the researchers studied the interaction between GLP-1 agonists and genes associated with dopamine signaling, including DRD3, BDNF and CREB1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that GLP1 receptor antagonists can disrupt the levels of dopamine in those with genes that reduce the activity of dopamine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This imbalance, they concluded, may increase the risk of depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers are now urging clinicians to consider genetic tests to better protect individuals who are at a high risk of developing depression whilst taking the popular weight loss drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Panayotis K. Thanos of Buffalo University commented: 'Before prescribing GLP1 receptor agonists, it would be prudent to use genetic testing tools to assess a patient’s dopamine function and risk profile.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While GLP-1 receptor agonists hold promise, we must remain vigilant about their potential harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This study is not intended to break the bubble of hope but to add a layer of precaution in their over-prescription,' Professor Igor Elman of Harvard University added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wegovy carries a depression warning on its label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

There have been two cases in Ingham County. Oakland, Kent and Macomb have each had one case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Nationally, two unvaccinated school-aged children have died from measles in Texas, as well as one unvaccinated adult in New Mexico, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I can't emphasize how worrisome it is for those of us who work in public health or in health care," said Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, Michigan's chief medical executive. "We already have 800 cases of measles ... just in the first four months alone. And if we continue on at this pace, this will be the worst year for measles that we've seen since before measles was declared eliminated in 2000."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Michigan's most recent measles case, the second one in Ingham County, involves a 1-year-old boy who was exposed to the county's first case. Ingham County and state health officials were notified Wednesday and said there was an exposure at Lansing Urgent Care – Frandor, 505 N.

"There was already this decline in vaccinations, and we've really seen a persistence in that vaccine hesitancy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The percentage of toddlers aged 19 to 36 months with at least one dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine fell from 85.3% in January 2020 to 80.2% in January 2025, according to &lt;a href="https://mcir.org/providers/local-health-departments-lhds/county-data/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;data from the Michigan Care Improvement Registry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective at preventing infection, while one is 93% effective against measles, according to the CDC. The first dose is typically administered between the ages of 12 and 15 months, and the second between the ages of 4 and 6 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"We've seen a persistence in distrust of science, of government, of public health, and that's leading us to see a resurgence of not just measles, but other communicable diseases as well," Bagdasarian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;At the same time, public health officials have had difficulty accessing databases run by federal partners, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I think it's really unfortunate that we also are seeing a lack of, or change in, federal guidance and attitude around communicable diseases, at the same time that all of this is happening," Bagdasarian said. "We've seen a shuffling of information on the website with a more prominent role of advice about Vitamin A, rather than advice about vaccines, which we know are the single greatest preventative measure we have for diseases like measles."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Connie Johnson, the communications director for the group Michigan for Vaccine Choice, said there are outbreaks of viral infections like measles in Michigan and the U.S. every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"And every year we are asked to respond to 'outbreaks' of less than a few hundred sick individuals," Johnson wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Less monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services terminated some CDC and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration grants last month, cancelling $380 million allocated to Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As a result of the cuts, some local positions dedicated to monitoring and investigating reportable diseases such as measles were eliminated. &lt;a href="/story/news/local/oakland-county/2025/04/02/over-3-7-million-in-federal-funding-for-public-health-programs-in-oakland-county-cut/82778633007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Oakland County lost five contracted public health workers&lt;/a&gt; whose job was to help with disease investigations and outbreak responses in long-term-care facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Mid-Michigan District Health Department, which serves Montcalm County, where Michigan's first measles outbreak since 2019 is underway, similarly lost $375,000 from an Infection Prevention and Healthcare-Associated Infections Response Support grant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The grant was intended to support staffing, personnel time, travel expenses, equipment and supplies, and professional development activities for staff working on infection prevention and control and health care-associated infection investigations and responses, &lt;a href="https://www.mmdhd.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-6-26-BOH-Meeting-Packet-combined_1.pdf" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;according to correspondence from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Brady Guilbault, public information officer for the Mid-Michigan District Health Department, said there are no public exposure sites for the cases associated with the outbreak in Montcalm County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Right now, we are definitely moving rapidly," Guilbault said. "We're in contact and working with those who are affected. So, yeah, we are doing everything that we can."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The health department is encouraging children and adults to make sure they're up-to-date with the measles vaccine and is hosting two free, walk-in vaccine clinics on Friday in Edmore and Tuesday in Carson City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Angela Bailey, director of Kids "R" Kids Childcare and Learning Center in Montcalm County, said she was aware of the outbreak in the county but wasn't aware of any cases in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I just pray that, you know, all the kids stay healthy and it goes away," Bailey said. "I don't have really any concerns. I mean that could be a different story tomorrow... Of course, if you notice a kid running a fever or sick, you send them home."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In Michigan, &lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/adult-child-serv/childrenfamilies/immunizations/healthcare/lhdwaivers" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;parents can obtain non-medical vaccine waivers&lt;/a&gt; for their children if they first receive education about the benefits of vaccination and the risks of disease from their local health department. Otherwise, immunizations are required for childcare, preschool and school. Bailey said she's only had two kids come through her day care with waivers in 17 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;'Whatever needs to be done'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Public health officials will do "whatever needs to be done" if Michigan faces more measles cases and outbreaks this year, said Bagdasarian, the state's medical executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"It is always harder to do a difficult job when you have fewer resources, and if there are further impacts to funding, if there are further impacts to CDC staff, it is going to impact us," Bagdasarian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Contact tracing for measles is very labor-intensive and expensive, Bagdasarian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The cost of a public health response to a single measles case ranges from $5,655 to $181,679, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6646a3.htm" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. This represents the personnel hours required for contact tracing and the coordination of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis, or efforts to protect or modify the clinical course of disease. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/php/awardees/current-cdc-vaccine-price-list.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;cost of one dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is just over $26, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The state's last outbreak was in 2019, which was also a bad year for measles, Bagdasarian said, when there were 46 cases, 42 of which were in Oakland County alone. Luckily, some of the same measures adopted to stop the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, including social distancing, masking and not traveling, also curbed measles, she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But public health has become a victim of its own success, she said. Measles was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, and many people and health providers don't remember how terrible the outbreaks are, Bagdasarian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Measles infection can cause serious illness and require hospitalization, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. One in every 1,000 cases will likely develop acute encephalitis, or swelling of the brain that can cause permanent damage. Between one and three of every 1,000 children who contract measles will likely die from respiratory and neurologic complications, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Because people don't remember how terrible this disease is, I think it makes it easier to say no to the vaccine," Bagdasarian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The state's health department has been trying to educate residents and providers about measles and make sure kids are up to date with their immunizations before 2025, Bagdasarian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"We sent out a notice last Friday to every single licensed health care provider in the state telling them to be on the lookout for measles, to watch videos, to brush up on their measles knowledge, to remind their patients who needs to get immunized, to remind their patients not to come into waiting rooms and emergency rooms without calling ahead if they think they have measles," Bagdasarian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The health department is counting on residents to tell providers when they are ill and on the providers to inform public health officials, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Measles is so incredibly transmissible — it can remain airborne for up to two hours — that the amount of contact tracing requires a lot of legwork, it requires a lot of really in-depth interviews," Bagdasarian said. "In a time where we have fewer resources than ever, there are folks who are working tirelessly to make sure that measles is not spread further, and it's a very labor-intensive and cost-intensive process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She likened the spread of measles to a wildfire. There is a lot of variability between communities in Michigan in terms of vaccine levels, she said. If a case occurs in a community with a low vaccination rate, there will likely be an outbreak, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Whether or not an ember will result in another wildfire depends on where it lands," Bagdasarian said, "and if it lands on a pile of kindling, there will be another wildfire."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;hmackay@detroitnews.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 03:03:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi7wFBVV95cUxOcHZTcGtlbExoZk5lOG9tX0dzRUJ0b1BPeTB2X29oZkNLNFVRNXlaRTR6MnNQYjVYRFcwUC1zZmpuTHJ5VVE2UDlSUXNNbjFqUDRkNXlnYlVfd3FwR3FWbUhxSmlEQUs2bWRZVUtTZ05yakpqY25PbHRIa2lpYU1nZ1A1VDNtYmtiV1oyUGhsZHIxRXRwNlZkOTF2d3JZQVA0d2VkbHVvWllWVnlLd2dzdGZtcWhVTDhDaEJBb1Njd0d3U001S0J2MVBrUlN0NmhpVzRVOFhKVThycGZWMVFvS3k5TWNsQ3NQaVRwU2NmTQ</guid></item><item><title>对破坏器官的寄生虫发出紧急警告-每日邮报 | Urgent warning over parasite that destroys your organs on the rise - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxQZThIWnY5OHNFWWxldVRBU0hyVUI1UWdTR09JU1VXb0RrQXl6Y2tmdThvWFBfdHNqZmpHQWEtQXoxQXJBRzVScjBETXNaNUxCRU9TSktFZlRXWmhSVVJoam5XUUl6VjA1ZnJtSml1NWlPWUFVQWtPa2VvOE9VU1VuLXN6X3BOU0VhTkRXQjZWYnBjSFlMajViWmkwcU9JOFBX0gGmAUFVX3lxTE1BRngtRGx3YlB1anhyTFZOa0tzQjE5TERVWFlXb2dzUnZma0ozSlh4ZElMc2FFU1BpcEFDR1Y2WG1mNVRjUHlSbkdXSTFNRjlmZGFQOVRVdjFKa1lpRml3STVWNi1uTmJYaldDT1RGOUpaY3dvT2dRazF6NXNNRzV4c0piMkRWMzhycmxZaHp5V1dmaHZMQ2JMMnM1QmVWZVVMUDJDNEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are sounding the alarm over the rise of a deadly parasite that, when contracted by humans, can cause fatal liver failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Echinococcus multilocularis, also known as the fox tapeworm, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14624879/worlds-largest-human-parasite-infected-man-tapeworm.html"&gt;mostly lives in wild animals&lt;/a&gt; like foxes. However, it can spread if animals or people come into contact with the tapeworm's eggs, which are present in the feces of those infected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The parasite enters the body and then multiplies in the liver. In humans, the fox tapeworm can cause an extremely rare liver-related infection known as alveolar echinococcosis (AE) that can lead to liver failure and death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A group of Swiss scientists have now discovered that cases of the tapeworm caused-infection, though still rare, are increasing by nearly three times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, while the parasite was once contained in Europe, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/china/index.html" id="mol-90190161-2155-11f0-b6dc-cb5820c2b3f0"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/japan/index.html" id="mol-90197690-2155-11f0-b6dc-cb5820c2b3f0"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; and Siberia, it is now spreading to regions of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/canada/index.html" id="mol-90190160-2155-11f0-b6dc-cb5820c2b3f0"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and parts of the United States, particularly in the Midwest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease is not reportable in the US, however, which makes it difficult to track and monitor the prevalence. The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-58947100-2157-11f0-b293-45006be3a59f"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; classifies the infection as a serious public health concern, particularly in areas with high populations of wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, data from the University Hospital Zurich shows in 1993, there were about two cases of AE recorded by the institution, while in 2022 - the latest year available - the number jumped to about 14. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Also known as the fox tapeworm, the parasite infects small rodents who unknowingly eat the feces and then multiplies in their livers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those involved in the study examined medical records of 334 patients who had alveolar echinococcosis were all treated at the University Hospital of Zurich between 1973 and 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Out of the 334 patients, 151 had some type of surgery to remove the parasites while 315 received drug therapy with the medication benzimidazole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They analyzed patient demographics, symptoms at diagnosis, AE stage, treatment strategy, treatment outcome, survival and causes of death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed that over the 50-year study period, 90 patients died but mostly from causes other than the parasitic infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only 13 deaths were directly caused by AE. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Survival analyses also showed that those with AE had lower survival rates compared with the general population five years after diagnosis, especially those who were diagnosed with AE later in life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, AE did not appear to be the main driver of their shortened life expectancy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also found that without benzimidazole therapy, 90 percent of patients died within 10 years of disease onset but with long-term therapy, they were able to prevent a disease from worsening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also concluded that removing all of the parasite-damaged tissue in the body through surgery could improve overall survival but could not slow down the disease.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it remains unclear why, authors of the study speculate that 'the gradual decline of relative survival five years after diagnosis could reflect a generally sicker population.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Accidentally ingesting tapeworm eggs often through contaminated food, water or soil, or through direct contact with infected animals can help the parasite enter the human body and begin spreading infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;AE causes parasitic tumors, primarily in the liver, that can spread to other organs like the lungs and brain in humans &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AE causes parasitic tumors, primarily in the liver, that can spread to other organs like the lungs and brain in humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the parasite doesn't fully mature into cysts, it invades and destroys tissue, leading to liver failure and death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms include &lt;span&gt;abdominal pain, jaundice, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-ed685270-2151-11f0-b6dc-cb5820c2b3f0" class=""&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;span&gt; weakness. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the CDC, people at high risk include 'trappers, hunters, veterinarians, or others who have contact with wild foxes, or coyotes, or their stool, or household dogs and cats that have the opportunity to eat wild rodents infected with AE'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The federal agency also recommends washing and cooking wild-picked foods carefully, keeping pets away from wild animals and their feces as well as maintaining good hand hygiene, especially after contact with animals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 00:50:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQZThIWnY5OHNFWWxldVRBU0hyVUI1UWdTR09JU1VXb0RrQXl6Y2tmdThvWFBfdHNqZmpHQWEtQXoxQXJBRzVScjBETXNaNUxCRU9TSktFZlRXWmhSVVJoam5XUUl6VjA1ZnJtSml1NWlPWUFVQWtPa2VvOE9VU1VuLXN6X3BOU0VhTkRXQjZWYnBjSFlMajViWmkwcU9JOFBX0gGmAUFVX3lxTE1BRngtRGx3YlB1anhyTFZOa0tzQjE5TERVWFlXb2dzUnZma0ozSlh4ZElMc2FFU1BpcEFDR1Y2WG1mNVRjUHlSbkdXSTFNRjlmZGFQOVRVdjFKa1lpRml3STVWNi1uTmJYaldDT1RGOUpaY3dvT2dRazF6NXNNRzV4c0piMkRWMzhycmxZaHp5V1dmaHZMQ2JMMnM1QmVWZVVMUDJDNEE</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，如果儿童疫苗接种率继续下降，未来25年美国麻疹病例可能会增加数百万- CNN | US may have millions more measles cases over next 25 years if childhood vaccination rates continue to decline, study says -

            Measles could become endemic in the United States if routine childhood vaccination rates continue to decline, with up to 51 million illnesses over a 25-year period, according to a new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Although the disease is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-measles-vaccination/data-research/global-measles-outbreaks/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;endemic in some other countries&lt;/a&gt; – meaning it happens regularly within an area or community – it was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" target="_blank"&gt;declared eliminated&lt;/a&gt; in the US in 2000 because of vaccination efforts with the highly effective measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.

            Nearly 900 measles cases have been recorded in the US this year, with more than half of states reporting at least one case, according to a CNN tally using data from state health departments and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of the cases have been linked with &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/health/measles-cases-us-dg/index.html"&gt;an outbreak&lt;/a&gt; centered on an area of West Texas with a large unvaccinated population.

            The researchers – from Stanford, Baylor, Rice and Texas A&amp;amp;M universities – estimate current state-by-state vaccination coverage for measles at 87.7% to 95.6%. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vuyeqd00093b6mk9hms08e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because measles is so contagious, experts say the only way to prevent outbreaks is if at least 95% of a community has received two doses of the MMR vaccine. After this rate was maintained for a decade, though, coverage dipped during the Covid-19 pandemic and has yet to recover. The measles vaccination rate fell to 92.7% for kindergartners in the 2023-24 school year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/02/health/measles-vaccine-coverage-kindergarten-school-requirement/index.html"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vuyeqd000a3b6mlhgbp34x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At current vaccination rates, the model predicts that the disease would become endemic in the US within 25 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vuyeqd000b3b6mhy8wpgg0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If the vaccination rate declines 10%, the US would see 11.1 million cases of measles over this period.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vuyeqd000c3b6mffd0xrw7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If current trends were reversed and there was a 5% increase in the number of people getting the MMR vaccine, however, there would be only 5,800 measles cases over 25 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vuyeqd000d3b6md4n41vv0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The model showed that other vaccine-preventable diseases shouldn’t become endemic in the US at current levels of vaccination. If, however, routine childhood vaccination falls 50%, it predicts 51.2 million measles cases over a 25-year period, 9.9 million cases of rubella, 4.3 million cases of poliomyelitis and 197 cases of diphtheria. With such a steep decline in vaccinations, these diseases would cause 10.3 million hospitalizations and 159,000 deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vuyeqd000e3b6mmbu6r3ht@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These findings support the need to continue routine childhood vaccination at high coverage to prevent resurgence of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases in the US,” the researchers wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vzpf3x0001336mdb32zqti@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the limitations of the study is that it doesn’t take into account that vaccination rates can fluctuate from community to community. Essentially, each state gets its own bucket, noted Dr. Mujeeb Basit, a modeling expert on disease spread who wasn’t involved with the new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vzhjpw0007336mfqy3pe9r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But the problem with that is, you’re comparing Texas to a smaller state like Rhode Island. So it’s not a homogenous distribution by size, so the accuracy of the numbers will fluctuate,” said Basit, a professor at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vzz2gg00033b6mbwu23tno@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But he said the issue is computationally difficult, and the researchers took a “really nice approach.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vzc3q30005336memsoa2fr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Research like this is important, he said, because it shows clearly that if vaccination trends continue, the US could experience continuous measles outbreaks that would have a cascading effect on the health system.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9w003yb00093b6md9486cdt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Hopefully, it will get people to think,” he said – and to act, getting protection through vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FORT SMITH, Ark. — A Fort Smith hospital and pet clinic have been listed as possible measles exposure locations, according to the Arkansas Department of Health (ADH).&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ADH said in a release on Thursday that someone from out of state visited Fort Smith while infected with measles. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During their stay, the person reportedly visited Mercy Hospital on April 19 from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Best Friend Pet Clinic on April 21 from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADH said that anyone at either location during those dates and times is "urged to get up to date on the MMR vaccine as quickly as possible" as it can stop the infection from developing if administered quick enough.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone at either of those locations may have been exposed and is encouraged to monitor symptoms from 21 days after possible exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ADH website said that as of April 18, three measles cases had been reported in Arkansas in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

These harms remained consistent throughout people’s forties, fifties and sixties.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Scientists said it showed the importance of quitting smoking and cutting down on alcohol before you hit middle age, in order to prevent years of ill-health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The study, published in Annals of Medicine, supports a celebrity trend for shifting to wellness in middle age. Figures such as Prince Harry, Sir Elton John and Gwyneth Paltrow were all known for partying hard in their twenties but have since cut down or given up on booze. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/stig-abell-midlife-turning-40-obsessive-37pks2rtd" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I’m an obsessive midlife man. Am I having a crisis?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Dr Tiia Kekalainen, a health scientist who worked on the study, said: “Our findings highlight the importance of tackling risky health behaviours, such as smoking, &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/alcohol-breast-cancer-risk-women-bowel-7nqsgg9xd" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;heavy drinking&lt;/a&gt; and physical inactivity, as early as possible to prevent the damage they do from building up over the years, culminating in poor mental and physical health later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“However, it is never too late to change to healthier habits. Adopting healthier habits in midlife also has benefits for older age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The study involved data from hundreds of children who were born in the Finnish city of Jyvaskyla in 1959. They completed health checks when they were 27 years old and again when they were aged 36, 42, 50 and 61. This involved assessing three risky behaviours — if they &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/french-paradox-heart-health-britain-xgjg9wksx" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;smoked, drank heavily and were inactive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;All three habits were associated with declines in both mental and physical health, with the effects apparent by the time participants were in their mid-thirties. Indulging in all three habits was particularly bad for health in the long term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The habits were linked to an array of non-infectious diseases such as heart disease and cancer, which cause almost three quarters of deaths worldwide. “By following a healthy lifestyle, an individual can cut their risk of developing these illnesses and reduce their odds of an early death,” said Kekalainen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="paywall-portal-article-footer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 23:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxQeVplRXp6RlhZMWhlajlva0l0UXpQemx6S3pqblRIb1BJc3p1Y0xYVDFpRXhDT3U2LUo0ZlphRnZLOFlCUmVMOUFfbG81bndhRVJ3ZTlfMjJfSmN6VVg3MTJqZ0FoLUROQ1ZMUS1pNldWUXM4elk1dnBPck9MVWh1TE91cElxTGdWWFQ2UE1uMFQ5eXNCOEE</guid></item><item><title>犹他州情侣分享终末期痴呆症诊断之旅- KSL TV 5 | Utah couple shares journey navigating a terminal dementia diagnosis - KSL TV 5</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxQckZfTDdJTFh4QmVvMTVwTmViOW01REFkenQ1bGg3RmVEc0FIYlVNMGF2cjFwZUpkVUZJTU5DeHBiZlF0eTR2YXQyX3lBdVNjcXByZW94MzA1U3pBWHFzM2Y1dlhGa3Z1bDIwaTJ5MnR0Y1BreU1TeGlaNWpmMzFROE9xRG9GSlc4RTB6Q0VCMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story_body"&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;TAYLORSVILLE — Misplacing car keys or having trouble remembering a specific date are normal signs of aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when is it “just getting older” and when could it be a more serious problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A dementia diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack and Debbie Lucas know firsthand how conditions like dementia can take a toll on an entire family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s really hard for me when I can’t remember something,” 69-year-old Debbie said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_767249" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-767249" class="wp-image-767249 size-full" src="https://ksltv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/brain_health_2_042425-e1745535279315.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-767249" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jack and Debbie Lucas know firsthand how conditions like dementia can take a toll on an entire family. (KSL TV)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debbie, whose mother had Alzheimer’s, went in for a cognitive test seven years ago and was told she had Alzheimer’s. But through additional genetic testing, she was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which affects less than one in 30 people with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To have that ultimate diagnosis of ‘it’s terminal’ was pretty significant,” Jack said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Frontotemporal dementia affects patients when certain areas of their brain start decreasing,” said Dr. Angel Lybbert, a geriatrician at Intermountain Health. “There’s different variants. You can have a language variant where it affects your ability to find words more prominently, and you can have a behavioral variant where your personality might change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four main types of dementia are Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and FTD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack said they are hoping for more research to be done on frontotemporal dementia, as Debbie’s genetic variant is extremely rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s just recently that we’re even delving into diagnosing people on that level and having the ability to do that with genetic testing,” Lybbert said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Signs of normal aging vs. dementia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While occasional confusion or forgetfulness can be normal with aging, Lybbert said signs of dementia include significant memory lapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You might see it in someone who is asking questions repetitively or having to be told about appointment times and things that you had just reviewed with them, forgetting important events, forgetting how to do things that were second nature; for example, navigating somewhere in the car to a familiar place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_767253" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-767253" class="wp-image-767253 size-full" src="https://ksltv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Debbie-Jack-Lucas-family-Apr-2025-e1745535423688.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-767253" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lucas family is celebrating Debbie’s birthday with roller skating. (Photo courtesy: Jack and Debbie Lucas)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lybbert said you can keep your brain sharp by getting regular exercise, eating pa healthy diet that includes plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, getting adequate sleep, managing medical conditions like high blood pressure, and staying mentally and socially engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Being isolated is a risk factor for dementia, so it’s important to keep those conversations going,” Lybbert said. “If it’s not in your personality to be super outgoing, have tons of friends, you don’t need to change who you are, but you have to talk to someone at least once a day. Just make sure you’re not spending days at a time alone in your home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack and Debbie take walks every day and continue to participate in other activities they enjoy, like roller skating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It helps me a lot to go visit the grandkids, to take them for an ice cream,” Debbie said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your quality of life is enhanced when you’re staying active, you’re eating right, and being involved socially, those typical things that you would do in any cognitive or dementia situation,” Jack said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One day at a time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some days are better than others, and Jack added that being a caregiver can be challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When your spouse starts not remembering your past…life is kind of made up of memories, and when you don’t have that, it’s an interesting aspect going forward,” Jack said. “It’s been more of an emotional rollercoaster for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But through it all — they’re still able to laugh and live life in the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s, you know, something that we can enjoy together for the moment,” Jack said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any memory-related concerns, talk to your primary care doctor. For people ages 65 and older, a mini cognitive screening is part of the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit.&lt;/p&gt;

The infected bat’s carcass was frozen and then sent to the California Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OC Health Care Agency encourages anyone who made physical contact with the bat — or saw anyone else do so — to inform its Disease Control Division to determine the risk of infection. Owners of pets that may have touched the bat are also asked to contact health authorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies is almost always fatal in humans once someone begins to show symptoms, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.ochealthinfo.com/press/bat-found-rancho-santa-margarita-tests-positive-rabies" target="_blank"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the Health Care Agency. That’s why it’s important for people to seek medical assistance promptly after a possible exposure, officials say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus is spread through an infected animal’s saliva, usually during a bite. Because bats have small teeth, their bites typically go unnoticed, heightening the risk of infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of April, the Los Angeles County &lt;a class="link" href="https://publichealth.lacounty.gov/vet/rabiesmap2025.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Department of Public Health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has documented two rabid bats this year, both around the Santa Clarita area. One of the bats was found dead in a residential backyard, the other was alive in the front yard of a home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-11-27/fresno-county-rabies-bat-bite-fatal"&gt;&lt;u&gt;In 2024, Fresno County&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recorded its first human rabies fatality in more than 30 years. The person was infected after being bitten by a bat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human cases of rabies are rare, but bats are the leading source of transmission, according to Orange County health officials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 22:59:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOVHJDNTZKNVl0TThXZkJYd3FLYlY0bTQzLVhaSU56NVk5UWJNTkR2LUNkSHV0V3pWeHpMcGkyV1lZSHg5VWdEWkdVTFY1VC1iY1huZHpRdzY4TDM4andmQlB5clJuRm14Yk1mQU9QMHYyZlNlSmk0T0FGQ1oxZTQ2ZmhZWVhtVlRIX3h0N0tEWGZwbERjZE8wNjBDMVdEeFUzUjlTcW82ZWE</guid></item><item><title>白血病和淋巴瘤地区- WKRC | Land of leukemia and lymphoma - WKRC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingNBVV95cUxPVEE2eFlpOFlBSDVFUkgyN000MndhRURMeW5PYlFLUDh6VTgzSXlOc044aU5nQnB1MFRWNTlQMHJBTUtNYktOdDM5RkZrbU9EWjdqS0UwRHZCblg5a0szY3BLZ1dnTzEwVHhCdTltd3RUdnE4MUViU2Z6b2Jwd1NEQ3ZPaWxycVBoX3l6dkItMjJqTHgxNEFnRUJzd3Y1bk5PYmgxRmxWMTJCSE9mLVF6bTRNQkU3V1NKTUtDbHhqWkJSMktHNVJ5T2VBWW83dWhGVGNOUTk1ZkpBcFpRZnFySDl0Qk01V2dubUh6YWk3YnJCRDJNLVF5VGQ0NU8wSUg3YnF2cnJNaGhVVGpNT3l0LTV2U2V5SVpQcDIxaWRtM3dMQ3dac2k5bFpBazFHVFowRW9BQXpMdUtERlVkWVJJN3lTNGhabUZLdkNyYTdsSTRvZ0VjRmV2akZXaVhPaEg5NDRsQ1o5Q3BWd2Z6elUxQ3IxUGU2V0xzSEl3YWxNMmpVN3UtUDhEU1N0SmhVV1k4LVNwcUpsS2hoNlY3OGc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;PIKE COUNTY, Ohio (WKRC) - After five years and dozens of remarkable investigative stories in our “Fallout” investigation that revealed contamination, high rates of cancer, and death, hundreds of cancer victims and their families gathered to join Local 12, filling the Piketon High School Auditorium on Saturday, April 12th for an emotional and candid Local 12 Town Hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone in the room stood when asked if they had cancer or lost a loved one, friend, or neighbor to the deadly disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), which owns and operates the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PORTS), a closed, massive uranium-enrichment facility near Piketon, insists there is no health threat posed by the plant, but when asked to raise their hands if they blame the government and PORTS for the contamination and cancer that’s claiming so many lives in the shadow of the plant, the auditorium was full of raised arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE VICTIMS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many told Local 12 how cancer had consumed their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;32-year-old Tesla McDowell, who lives near Lucasville, has been diagnosed with a genetic mutation that can lead to pancreatic cancer. She said that her family has been devastated by the deadly disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I've lost 17 members of my family on every side to cancer,” McDowell told the stunned crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others came to the town hall to describe their own cancers, with some describing their own battles as hopeless. 58-year-old Cheryl Day, who lives in Yankee Hill, was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014.   Last year, it came back and has now spread to her brain and spine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's all throughout my body,” Day told the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heather Bennett talked about trying to stay alive for her daughters as breast cancer continues to spread throughout her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I want to watch my girls walk this stage literally to graduate,” Bennett said, pointing to the front of the high school auditorium where she now fought back tears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April Harr, who once lived in an apartment at Fox Run on Beaver Creek Road near PORTS, talked about cancer spreading throughout her body, too.    What first was diagnosed as rectal cancer spread to her lungs and liver.   She’s had 18 tumors removed.  Two remain, including one that persists in her colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked if she’s going to make it, Harr was hopeful but hesitant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “I hope so,” Harr said. “I'm scared."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEARS FOR BOBBY:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arguably, the most emotional moments at the town hall came when parents described losing their children to cancer. Bob Malone began sobbing when it was his turn to talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m so sorry,” Malone said, wiping away tears that he had held back for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malone described raising his son, Bobby, in a house near Happy Hollow Road in the 80s, which is little more than a mile from PORTS.   In 1985, Bobby, who was just two years old, was diagnosed with rhabdosarcoma.   Surgeons removed a six-pound tumor before Malone’s son passed away in 1987.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he broke down again, Malone trembled as he described the loss of his son, which changed his life forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve lived in some dark places,” said Malone. “I just want my son to be recognized."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOSING CHILDREN TO LEUKEMIA:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many parents talk about their awful pain, too.   Most at the town hall had lost their children to leukemia. Shawna Mullins, who lost her 15-year-old son Garrett to AML leukemia in 2016, said that he loved everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larry Farmer talked about his best friend and son, Zach, an All-American baseball player, who was raised at a home just outside the fence line of PORTS.   Zach, who was playing ball at Ohio State, was diagnosed with AML leukemia in 2014.  He died in 2015 at the age of 21. When asked if life has been the same since Zach passed away, Larry answered:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No. Absolutely not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brad and Michelle Lykins, who live less than seven miles from PORTS, described the awful pain and loss of their son, Braden, who died in 2021, just three days after being diagnosed with APL leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He was screaming in pain and asking us, ‘What's wrong with me? What's wrong with me?'" Michelle Lykins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the town hall, Local 12 worked with three local mothers to begin documenting cancers in communities surrounding PORTS. In our non-scientific survey, we documented more than a thousand cancer cases and more than 60 cases of leukemia and lymphoma, a related blood cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AN EXPERT TAKES A LOOK AT LEUKEMIA &amp;amp; LYMPHOMA:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local 12 traveled to Morgantown, West Virginia, to meet up with a nationally recognized occupational and environmental health expert, who had studied a much more detailed accounting of reported cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, Dr. Charles “Carl” Werntz asked the Ohio Department of Health for protected health data, which included details of reported cancers in the state from 1996 through 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using that data, Dr. Werntz said that he selected five census tracts around the plant to determine granular data about cancers near PORTS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It would focus in on the area around the plant that would be most exposed,” said Dr. Werntz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That examination led to a close look at leukemia and lymphoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those are definitely radio-sensitive cancers, cancers that are caused by radiation,” Dr. Werntz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"SHOCKING" RATE AROUND PORTS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2021 report delivered to Kevin Thompson, an attorney representing several cancer victims near PORTS, Dr. Werntz laid out his findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After reviewing the cases, Dr. Werntz determined the rate of leukemia and lymphoma in children and young people under the age of 25 in that small zone around PORTS is 4.9 per 1,000. Dr. Werntz then randomly selected 12 census tracts he randomly selected across Ohio, including industrialized parts of Cleveland, and found the comparison rate to be 1.62.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a leukemia and lymphoma rate around PORTS that’s three times higher than other parts of Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Dr. Werntz emphasized his study was “incredibly preliminary” and more study is needed to pinpoint the causes, he said that it’s clear that leukemia and lymphoma cases are happening at alarming rates around the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is shocking data that, to me, shows an increased occurrence of those cancers in that community,” said Dr. Werntz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"IN THE DARK UNTIL IT HAPPENS TO YOU": &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local 12 traveled to Piketon to share Dr. Werntz’s study with Brad and Michelle Lykins, the parents who told the tragic story of losing their son, Braden, to leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After explaining the results to them inside the house where they raised their son, they said the report “hit home.” While the Lykins say they hear stories about cancer happening all the time in their community, they said that they’ve never been told about the high numbers of leukemia and lymphoma around PORTS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unless you have somebody to [show you] the studies, they [the government] don’t make you aware of anything like that," Michelle Lykins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the Lykins, like many families near PORTS, continue to grieve their loss and say they worry about their future in the shadow of the Cold War plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michelle glanced out the window at a cloudy day and simply uttered, “You're in the dark until it happens to you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WKRC</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 22:52:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>不信任RFK Jr.的公共卫生领导者站出来捍卫疫苗- statnews.com | Public health leaders, distrustful of RFK Jr., stand up project to defend vaccines - statnews.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQOVZ6dTNuMll1T2YwMENycmxCTExnRGFXV0F6MGJTQ1hYZFJJeGl6M055MkVCcEJNdVBjQTZXekdseW5ZajJ5anAydEJuOHo2anNhZU8teTNBZ2thblA3WVd1U3pPcHV4aDEySU92QWYyY21vRWc3a0hnR0ZJOUJIRnNWX1ZmSTZDeW5qazJLVlM1VnVDakNFNg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some key public health figures are taking an extraordinary step to try to shore up U.S. vaccination policy, feared to be under threat from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/28/rfk-jr-vaccines-kennedy-confirmation-hearing-vaccination-policy-hhs-secretary/"&gt;longtime vaccine critic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The “Vaccine Integrity Project,” which was publicly launched Thursday by the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, will be aimed at assessing the best ways for vaccine proponents to safeguard vaccination policy and information, should government recommendations and information sources become “corrupted,” Michael Osterholm, director of the center, said during a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though plans for the project are still taking shape, Osterholm said it might go so far as to create a new independent body to evaluate the science supporting individual vaccines — a task that at this point falls squarely in the domain of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Osterholm stressed, though, that the body, if formed, could not serve as a shadow version of the ACIP. That’s because it would not have the same legal authorities as the ACIP, such as deciding which vaccines must be provided through the Vaccines for Children Program. The program provides vaccinations for free to children who qualify; &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7333e1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;just over half&lt;/a&gt; of U.S. children are eligible for vaccines through VFC. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Margaret Hamburg, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, and Harvey Fineberg, a former president of the Institute of Medicine — now known as the National Academy of Medicine — will chair a steering committee that will spend the summer meeting with key stakeholders to decide how the project should proceed. They suggested some of the actions the group may explore include developing clinical guidelines and identifying areas where further research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“We take up the Vaccine Integrity Project as a precautionary step,” the two wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/24/vaccine-integrity-project-acip-cdc-fda-rfk-jr-trump-political-interference"&gt;an opinion piece&lt;/a&gt; published Thursday in STAT. “Should ACIP or FDA processes or scientific evaluation become compromised, America cannot afford to be left without any organized systems to ensure that evidence grounded in science continues to guide decisions about the use of vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Andrew Nixon, HHS communications director, dismissed the project as an “unaccountable group of former officials circling the wagons to protect outdated narratives.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Secretary Kennedy and Director Bhattacharya will continue to prioritize open scientific debate and [the] Gold Standard of Science to inform decision making,” Nixon wrote in an email. Jay Bhattacharya is the director of the National Institutes of Health, an agency that neither approves vaccines nor makes recommendations on how they should be used.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy for years led Children’s Health Defense, an organization that opposes vaccine mandates and argues that vaccines themselves are dangerous despite health officials’ and experts’ statements to the contrary. He also has been involved in a number of personal injury lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since being confirmed as HHS secretary, Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/03/rfk-jr-vaccine-skepticism-on-view-in-texas-measles-outbreak-response/"&gt;stressed that getting vaccinated is a personal choice&lt;/a&gt; and has demanded that agency websites under his control highlight that view.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even though the country is in the grips of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/18/measles-outbreak-could-last-a-year-texas-public-health-official-predicts/"&gt;one of the largest measles outbreaks in decades&lt;/a&gt; — an outbreak that has already claimed three lives — he has refrained from publicly urging parents to get their children vaccinated. Though it is common for public health leaders to strongly advocate for vaccination in such situations, the furthest Kennedy has gone is to say that vaccination is the best way to contain measles. He has also &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/10/rfk-jr-measles-vaccines-outbreak-comments/"&gt;raised safety concerns about the vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, and suggested two children who died from measles in West Texas actually succumbed to other illnesses. (In addition to the Texas children, an unvaccinated adult in New Mexico died.)&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;He has been a vocal critic of the ACIP, alleging that the vast majority of its members have conflicts of interests. There have been fears that he might try to replace members of the committee with people whose views on vaccines are more aligned with his own, or undermine its work in other ways. Earlier this week &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/22/trump-pull-covid-vaccine-recommendation-children-00304091" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Politico reported&lt;/a&gt; that he is considering unilaterally striking Covid vaccines from the childhood vaccination schedule, a guide devised by the ACIP and the CDC and used by medical professionals to determine which vaccines children should receive, and at what age. If Covid vaccines were no longer listed on the childhood immunization schedule, insurance companies would not have to pay for the vaccines and they would not be eligible for provision through the Vaccines for Children Program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Osterholm said that the aim of the Vaccine Integrity Project is to try to establish a roadmap for what could be done if government sources of information on vaccines can no longer be trusted. “We all recognize that the vaccine enterprise is at some risk right now,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The effort is being funded through an unrestricted grant from Alumbra, a foundation established by philanthropist Christy Walton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The discovery was made in a residential backyard in Maine where researchers were collecting rabbit ticks and testing them for pathogens, according to &lt;a href="https://www.umass.edu/news/article/umass-amherst-tick-researchers-identify-new-strain-rickettsia-bacteria-causes-spotted" target="_blank"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The new bacteria, &lt;i&gt;Rickettsia &lt;/i&gt;sp. ME2023, can cause spotted fever rickettsioses in humans, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which has a death rate of 20 to 30 percent if not treated promptly with the antibiotic doxycycline, the statement said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;When the ticks from Maine tested positive for a bacteria like the one that causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Guang Xu, a research professor of microbiology at UMass Amherst, conducted DNA testing that identified a distinct new strain, “unlike any other known strain,” but similar to one that caused severe cases of fever in California a few years ago, the statement said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We now know there is something different, something novel, than what was previously known,” Stephen Rich, a microbiologist at UMass Amherst, said in the statement. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Although rabbit ticks can be found throughout North and South America, they are uncommon in New England.

This finding may solve part of the puzzle. Maybe the rabbit ticks are the vector.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The discovery was made by scientists working on &lt;a href="https://www.newvec.org/itch" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.newvec.org/itch"&gt;Project ITCH&lt;/a&gt;, an acronym for Is Tick Control Helping, which surveys residential properties across New England, to develop best practices for local trick control. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Researchers next plan to work with rabbit hunters in Massachusetts to collect more ticks and further their understanding of the potential impact on public health, Rich said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Collaborating researchers at the University of Maine sent UMass Amherst more rabbit ticks to test.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The test results showed that out of 296 ticks collected from 38 towns in nine counties in Maine, 6.1 percent tested positive for the new &lt;i&gt;Rickettsia&lt;/i&gt; genotype, according to the statement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“This wasn’t a needle in a haystack,” said Rich, executive director of the New England Center of Excellence in Vector-borne Diseases at UMass Amherst. “It looks like lots of the rabbit ticks there have this pathogen.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Though rabbit ticks don’t often feed on people, researchers are eager to figure out the risk and possibility of “spill over” into ticks that bite both rabbits and people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“For example, a deer tick could feed on a rabbit and pick up this infection from the rabbit tick and potentially infect a person with that,” Rich said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But some experts on tick-borne diseases and disorders caution that the rabbit tick research is still in the early stages. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;While the findings are “interesting,” it is “premature to say that it has any public health significance,” said Sam Telford III, professor and director of the department of infectious disease and global health at Tufts University.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Epidemiological studies are needed to make that determination, Telford said in an email.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“There are many infectious agents that are maintained by ticks, but relatively few of them have been demonstrated to cause human disease,” Telford said. “This demonstration rests on actual case reports of human disease.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Professor Thomas Mather, who heads the Tick Encounter Resource Center at the University of Rhode Island, said that since rabbit ticks rarely bite humans they probably don’t “represent much of a direct risk for humans.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Out of more than 85,000 photos of ticks submitted to the University of Rhode Island’s tick survey, only two or three were this type of rabbit tick, Mather said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“People rarely encounter them,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“But, it definitely could help the new strain circulate more widely in nature with an increasing risk for spillover” from ticks that do bite humans, Mather added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Spotted-fever infections, typically spread by dog ticks, have climbed in the past two decades in the United States from 495 cases in 2002 to a peak of 6,248 in 2017, according to information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;More than half of the cases between 2018 and 2022 were from Alabama, Arkansas, Missouri, North Carolina, and Tennessee, according to the CDC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

&lt;p&gt;A Walmart, a restaurant, a grocery store and more are among the locations where potential exposures to a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/measles-case-confirmed-in-southern-illinois-idph/3729310/"&gt;measles case in Illinois&lt;/a&gt; may have taken place, health officials warned Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Illinois Department of Public Health, seven locations have been identified as "sites of potential exposures" between April 7 and April 15. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"Anyone at those locations in that time frame should contact their health care provider if they exhibit measles symptoms," the department said in a release, noting that the risk of contracting measles in the general public in Illinois remains low. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new information comes one day after the state reported its first confirmed measles case of 2025. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possible exposure locations include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don Sol Restaurant, Marion IL    &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Legacy Fitness, Marion IL  &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Walmart, Marion IL &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Kroger Grocery, Marion IL &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Wonder Wash Laundry, Marion IL&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Easy Coin Laundry, Marion IL&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Small Star Laundry, Marion IL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officials urged anyone who visited those locations during the timing window to monitor for symptoms for 21 days from the day they were potentially exposed. Symptoms include a fever, cough, runny nose, pink eye or a rash that starts around the head or face and spreads through the rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt;
			
	
&lt;p&gt;"The chances of infection are minimal for those who are immune to measles either from vaccination or prior infection. If anyone exposed starts exhibiting measles symptoms, they should notify their medical provider," IDPH said in its alert. "If someone with measles symptoms needs to be seen in person by a health care professional, they should notify their provider or health facility in advance so appropriate precautions can be taken to avoid additional exposures or spread of the illness."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illinois health officials first announced the confirmed case Wednesday, noting that it was reported in a patient in far southern Illinois. The case was confirmed through laboratory testing, with no outbreak currently present in the state.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The case marks the first in Illinois since an outbreak in Chicago in early 2024 that resulted in a total of 67 cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, an outbreak in Texas and New Mexico has led to over 680 confirmed cases and three deaths, with over 800 cases reported nationwide, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This first reported case of measles in Illinois in 2025 is a reminder to our Illinois residents that this disease can be prevented with up-to-date vaccination,” IDPH Director Dr. Sameer Vohra said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people are vaccinated routinely during childhood and are not a high risk of measles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officials said the highest concern is for infants, as children receive their first vaccine dose between 12 and 15 months of age, and individuals who can't get vaccinated for other health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who believes they may have been exposed to measles are encouraged to contact their health care provider about protection through prior vaccination or the need for future vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The key to preventing measles is the highly effective measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of measles vaccine are 97% effective in preventing measles,” Vohra said. “I recommend that our Illinois residents make sure that they and their family members are up to date on the MMR vaccine and all other age-appropriate immunizations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of preparations for a potential measles outbreak, Illinois health officials previously launched a &lt;a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/prevention-wellness/immunization/coverage-dashboards/measles-outbreak-simulator-dashboard.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/prevention-wellness/immunization/coverage-dashboards/measles-outbreak-simulator-dashboard.html"&gt;Measles Outbreak Simulator Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;, which shows the potential progress of an outbreak in schools based on vaccination data.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We know sleep quality is vital &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/losing-just-one-nights-sleep-changes-your-immune-system-study-finds"&gt;for good health&lt;/a&gt;, that adolescence is an important time &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/teens-brains-develop-differently-depending-on-if-theyre-night-owls-or-early-birds"&gt;for brain development&lt;/a&gt;, and that teens don't always get a huge amount of sleep – and new research gives us some fresh insights into how that all fits together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With data for 3,222 adolescents between the ages of 9 and 14 years of age, researchers from institutions in China and the UK split the cohort up into three groups: those with the worst sleep habits (averaging 7 hours, 10 minutes per night), those with the best &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-explain-what-a-good-nights-sleep-actually-looks-like"&gt;sleep habits&lt;/a&gt; (7 hours, 25 minutes), and those in between (7 hours, 21 minutes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there wasn't much difference between these groups in terms of academic achievement, the best sleepers showed noticeable improvements in cognitive tests for reading, problem solving, and focus, compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-brain-starts-eating-itself-when-it-doesn-t-get-enough-sleep"&gt;worst sleepers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_159118" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159118" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/SleepBiotypes.jpg" alt="Sleep biotypes" class="wp-image-159118 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/SleepBiotypes.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/SleepBiotypes-630x415.jpg 630w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/SleepBiotypes-600x395.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-159118" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers used sleep data to put the participants into three groups. In terms of overall sleep performance, biotype 3 is the best, biotype 1 is the worst, and biotype 2 is in the middle. (Ma et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even though the differences in the amount of sleep that each group got was relatively small, at just over a quarter-of-an-hour between the best and worst sleepers, we could still see differences in brain structure and activity and in how well they did at tasks," &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/adolescents-who-sleep-longer-perform-better-at-cognitive-tasks"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; clinical neuropsychologist Barbara Sahakian from the University of Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This drives home to us just how important it is to have a good night's sleep at this important time in life."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group of young people who slept the longest per night was also observed to have the largest brain volumes, the lowest &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/heart-rate-zones-explained-heres-how-to-optimize-your-exercise-routine"&gt;heart rates&lt;/a&gt;, and the highest levels of brain connectivity, compared to the other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_159120" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159120" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/SleepPatterns.jpg" alt="Sleep patterns over time" class="wp-image-159120 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/SleepPatterns.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/SleepPatterns-600x298.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-159120" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cognitive performance and brain characteristics were tracked over time. (Ma et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somewhat worryingly, most of the young people fell into the group with the poorest set of sleep data: 39 percent of the total. The middle group had 24 percent of the participants in it, while the group that scored highest on sleep made up 37 percent of the kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research isn't enough to prove cause and effect when it comes to sleep and brain function, and it's worth noting that the cognitive differences between the groups weren't huge – but taken with other &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/delay-school-day-adolescents-improves-wellbeing-and-alertness"&gt;similar studies&lt;/a&gt;, it adds to the evidence that young brains need to be protected by sleep, and that every minute counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although our study can't answer conclusively whether young people have better brain function and perform better at tests because they sleep better, there are a number of studies that would support this idea," &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/adolescents-who-sleep-longer-perform-better-at-cognitive-tasks"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; psychologist Qing Ma from Fudan University in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other pieces of research have gone into plenty of detail about how sleep is linked to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/deep-sleep-is-the-anti-anxiety-drug-we-ve-been-looking-for-brain-scans-reveal"&gt;mental well-being&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/losing-just-one-nights-sleep-changes-your-immune-system-study-finds"&gt;physical health&lt;/a&gt;, and this latest study is a reminder to teens and parents to maybe spend a few minutes less &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/screen-time-in-bed-may-increase-insomnia-odds-study-suggests"&gt;on mobile devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Regularly getting a good night's sleep is important in helping us function properly," &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/adolescents-who-sleep-longer-perform-better-at-cognitive-tasks"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sahakian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While we know a lot about sleep in adulthood and later life, we know surprisingly little about sleep in adolescence, even though this is a crucial time in our development."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2025.115565"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

By identifying unique DNA junctions from each patient’s tumor, the test can detect tumor DNA in the bloodstream, even before changes appear on MRI scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These DNA fragments bypass some limitations of the blood-brain barrier, offering a sensitive early warning for disease advancement. The test detected tumor activity in 93% of cases, showing promise as a clinical tool for tailoring treatments and monitoring outcomes in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DNA Junction Focus:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers targeted tumor-specific DNA junctions, which are more abundant and easier to detect than other fragments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Detection:&lt;/strong&gt; Tumor DNA levels in blood sometimes rose before any visible MRI changes, offering earlier insights.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Accuracy:&lt;/strong&gt; The personalized test detected tumor DNA in 93% of patients with known DNA junctions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mayo Clinic researchers have identified a potential new way to monitor the progression of high-grade gliomas, one of the most aggressive types of brain cancer. Their feasibility study suggests that a personalized blood test tailored to each patient’s tumor DNA could provide a faster and less invasive way to determine if the cancer is advancing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, clinicians rely on scans and surgical biopsies to monitor gliomas, but both methods have limitations. For example, scans often cannot distinguish tumor growth from treatment effects such as inflammation. Biopsies require invasive procedures, making them impractical for routine monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109109"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and a test tube." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The test detected tumor DNA in approximately 93% of the cases where these DNA junctions were present. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new approach, published in &lt;em&gt;Clinical Cancer Research&lt;/em&gt;, may provide clinicians with another tool to monitor tumor changes over time and adjust treatment as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings focus on tumor DNA fragments circulating in the blood. As gliomas grow, some glioma cells die, shedding pieces of their DNA into the bloodstream and leaving behind genetic markers that are unique to the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, gliomas release fewer DNA fragments into the blood compared to many other cancers. This is because of the blood-brain barrier, a natural brain defense that prevents many substances from leaving the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome this limitation, researchers focused on DNA junctions, a type of tumor-specific DNA fragment that is present in higher quantities. By targeting these markers, researchers achieved greater sensitivity, enabling them to detect even the smallest signs of tumor progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike normal DNA, which follows a structured sequence, these DNA junctions form when the tumor’s genetic material breaks and rearranges. The study found that these amplified DNA junctions, due to their higher numbers, may provide a clearer picture of disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research builds on years of studying genetic rearrangements and gives us a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving gliomas,” says lead author George Vasmatzis, Ph.D., co-director of the Biomarker Discovery Program at Mayo Clinic’s Center for Individualized Medicine and Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It offers new possibilities for patient-specific monitoring and targeted interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, researchers analyzed samples from patients with high-grade gliomas. They used whole genome sequencing to map each tumor’s unique genetic blueprint and pinpointed patient-specific DNA junctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers then developed personalized blood tests to search for these genetic markers in plasma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test detected tumor DNA in approximately 93% of the cases where these DNA junctions were present. In some patients, tumor DNA levels in the blood rose before MRI scans showed any changes — offering a potential early signal for disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connecting cutting-edge research and clinical practice, Dr. Vasmatzis and Terry Burns, M.D., Ph.D., a neurosurgeon at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, collaborated on the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By tracking each tumor’s distinct molecular signature, we’re aiming to shift from a reactive approach to one that’s far more proactive,” says Dr. Burns, a study co-author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research could lay the groundwork for tools that help clinicians make the most informed treatment decisions as early as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies will evaluate how well blood-based tumor tracking correlates with glioma progression across a larger group of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this brain cancer and genetics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#89e7ecfefaebfcfbece8fcc9e4e8f0e6a7ecedfc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sharon Theimer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mayo.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Sharon Theimer – Mayo Clinic&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article/doi/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-24-3233/754481/Personalized-Tumor-Specific-Amplified-DNA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Personalized Tumor-Specific Amplified DNA Junctions in Peripheral Blood of Patients with High-Grade Gliomas&lt;/a&gt;” by George Vasmatzis et al. &lt;em&gt;Clinical Cancer Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalized Tumor-Specific Amplified DNA Junctions in Peripheral Blood of Patients with High-Grade Gliomas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitoring disease progression in patients with high-grade gliomas (HGG) is challenging due to treatment-related changes in imaging and the requirement for neurosurgical intervention to obtain diagnostic tissue. DNA junctions in HGG often amplify oncogenes, making these DNA fragments potentially more abundant in blood than monoallelic mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we piloted a cell-free DNA approach for disease detection in the plasma of patients with HGG by leveraging patient-specific DNA junctions associated with oncogene amplifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experimental Design:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole-genome sequencing of grade 3 or 4 isocitrate dehydrogenase–mutant or wild-type astrocytomas was utilized to identify amplified junctions. Individualized qPCR assays were developed using patient-specific primers designed for the amplified junction. ctDNA levels containing these junctions were measured in patient plasma samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unique amplified junctions were evaluated by individualized semi-qPCR assays in presurgical plasma of 18 patients, 15 with tumor-associated focal amplifications and three without tumor-associated focal amplifications. high copy-number junctions were robustly detected in the plasma of 14 of 15 (93.3%) patients with amplified junctions and none of the controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in junction abundance correlated with disease trajectory in serial plasma samples from five patients, including increased abundance of amplified junctions preceding radiographic disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In patients with grade 3 or 4 astrocytomas who had tumor-associated amplifications, patient-specific amplified junctions were successfully detected in assayed plasma from most patients. Longitudinal analysis of plasma samples correlated with disease trajectory, including cytoreduction and progression.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 21:49:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFBUdml6VWFXM3BPR2pvTV9WYnFXZXJ3YWEwSjZNckhrX2t4TThtM281bnFaa0xFc0hoTk56NzVNZHV4NGhnZUdEZElKeHBOeEdIVUVkQ3JUVWRvNU9fRkRiUFlKQzdRX19hejdJc0x1TW0</guid></item><item><title>新研究表明，您摄入的蛋白质可以帮助您延长寿命- EatingWell | The Kind of Protein You Eat Could Help You Live Longer, New Study Suggests - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTFBVb1ZSV1pHb25FTDl0dDVOUlFLNW04cWVzUWl5bDk0b0xpeDByeE9jaXE1c0Rhb3hfak5UcVFrUzRzQm5oX0dHRlY5bzU2bC13TmYyTzdJUkhNVnFObGk5RmlBVkpMMzVXVkxv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-blockquote" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Over the last few years, there has been mounting evidence that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7775696/plant-based-diet-for-beginners-your-guide-to-getting-started/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating more plants&lt;/a&gt;—including whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds—benefits health in many ways, primarily in reducing disease risk. This is partly due to plants’ effects on our microbiomes, as they provide plenty of fiber that acts as food for beneficial bacteria to thrive and multiply. A healthy microbiome has been linked with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lower chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/fiber-intake-metabolic-disease-risk-research-8729291" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;disease risk&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s not all, though. Plants also contain antioxidants, vitamins and minerals necessary for optimal health, plus macronutrients, including healthy fats, carbohydrates and protein. It’s this last nutrient that researchers in Australia wanted to take a closer look at. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study is a little different, as most studies we cover assess individuals’ dietary habits. This study, on the other hand, takes a broader look at the food available in different countries and how long people in those countries tend to live. The findings were published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s see what they found.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study aimed to assess how the nutritional environment is associated with age-specific mortality (death) in 101 countries. Specifically, it considered animal-based protein (ABP; meat, poultry, seafood dairy and eggs) and plant-based protein (PBP) availability in these countries to see how they were associated with longevity. To do so, researchers used the geometric framework for nutrition (GFN). This framework examines undernutrition, overnutrition and nutrient amounts and compositions—that includes which macro- and micronutrients foods are made up of). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers also used food balance sheets (FBS) and life tables, which provide data on the average availability of food and nutrients at the national level and break the data down according to potential confounders that could skew results, like age, sex and the country’s level of wealth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Using these parameters, researchers could predict the effects of ABP, PBP, fat and carbohydrate availability on a country and assess their influence on longevity at different age points, specifically children who live to age 5 and adults who live to age 60.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-show"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Show? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After running statistical analyses, including adjusting for confounders, researchers found that higher animal-based protein supplies were associated with enhanced survival during infancy and early childhood, independent of total calorie supplies. In other words, regardless of how much total food is available in a country, higher availability of animal protein is linked with infants and children surviving to at least 5 years old. Researchers also found that when overall protein availability was low—regardless of the type of protein—survival rates were also low in infants and children under 5.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even so, plant-based protein was associated with better longevity in adults.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers explain that animal-based protein early in life provides complete proteins that are more easily digestible and absorbable compared to many plant-based protein sources.  In addition, compared to plants, animal-based protein also provides more fat and nutrients essential for proper growth and development in infancy and childhood. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to these researchers, nutrients like iron, zinc and vitamin A are often lacking in developing countries where under-5 mortality is high, and animal-based protein may be an easier provider of these nutrients. Study authors note that some infant and childhood deaths can also be attributed to maternal undernutrition and deficiencies during pregnancy, and that providing animal-based protein may more easily help fill this gap. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is not to say that plant protein should be neglected in infancy and childhood, since researchers note that adding energy from any protein source—animal or plant—is better than not getting enough protein overall, especially in countries where food may be more scarce. They add that plant-based diets show promise for children, as long as they are balanced and varied to provide complete amino acids and enough fat for proper development.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Interestingly, the association between animal proteins and longevity weakens as we age, with plant-based proteins becoming more positively influential, since another major finding of this study was that plant-based-rich environments were associated with improved survival later in life. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers note that the data used for this study cannot differentiate between ultra-processed foods and meats and other sources of animal protein, so they cannot state with certainty based on their study which types of animal proteins are linked to early death. With that said, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ultra-processed-foods-cardiovascular-disease-risk-8708994" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt; link regular consumption of ultra-processed foods, processed meats and foods high in added sugar with chronic disease—including heart disease, stroke and diabetes—and dying younger. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study also linked higher fat availability, especially in countries where animal-based proteins were more plentiful, to dying younger. Though the researchers weren’t able to differentiate between processed meat and meat in general, one could hypothesize that some of the excessive fat consumption likely comes from ultra-processed foods and meats.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study authors name several limitations of this study. For example, their findings are limited because they are based on national food supply data, not individual dietary intake. Because of this, they could not account for the many variables that can influence longevity. This analysis also doesn’t account for the differences between types of carbohydrates and fats, including the different types of carbs, like refined carbs, complex carbs with fiber and sugar, nor between saturated fats, polyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it can mean different things to different people, eating plant-based doesn’t necessarily mean completely going vegan, or even vegetarian (which includes some animal products, like eggs and dairy). If you’re not ready to completely give up meat, consider increasing your intake of plants by swapping your typical meat-based recipes for more plant-forward ones. Some good sources of plant protein that are easy to start with include legumes, soy, tofu, nuts, seeds and whole grains, like quinoa and amaranth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re a big fan of meat at dinner, you could also try some recipes that stretch animal-based protein with some tasty plant protein. That’s especially easy to do when you use ground meat, like we do in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269787/beef-bean-sloppy-joes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Beef &amp;amp; Bean Sloppy Joes&lt;/a&gt;, or when you make a fun grain bowl, like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7870644/pesto-chicken-quinoa-bowls/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Pesto Chicken Quinoa Bowls&lt;/a&gt;. Combining plant- and animal-based proteins is also the point of eating plans like the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/flexitarian-diet-dinner-recipes-for-beginners-7160257" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;flexitarian diet&lt;/a&gt;, which balances both for filling, tasty meals that can help you ease into trying out vegan protein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can also make some easy swaps to add more plants to your diet. For example, instead of pizza with pepperoni, sausage, ham or beef, make it a veggie pizza. Rather than having bacon and sausage with your eggs, consider making a veggie hash—like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7950433/sweet-potato-broccoli-wild-rice-hash/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Sweet Potato, Broccoli &amp;amp; Wild Rice Hash&lt;/a&gt;—or something saucy like these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/264141/baked-eggs-in-tomato-sauce-with-kale/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Baked Eggs in Tomato Sauce with Kale&lt;/a&gt;. Now and then, swap your burger or taco with a vegetarian version, like we do in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250670/quinoa-veggie-burger/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Quinoa Veggie Burger&lt;/a&gt; and our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8043180/vegetarian-tacos/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Best Vegetarian Tacos&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most of our recipes and meal plans stay away from ultra-processed plant-based “meats,” like those that mimic the taste and texture of animal proteins like burgers, bacon and hot dogs. Ultra-processed meat, whether from animal or plant sources, usually isn’t the best choice for your health. For example, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7993257/is-plant-based-meat-healthy-heres-what-a-dietitian-has-to-say/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;evidence that eating plant-based meat products&lt;/a&gt; can increase your intake of calories, fat, sugar and salt, and that those who regularly rely on these products may end up with deficiencies in key nutrients, including calcium, potassium, magnesium, zinc and vitamin B12.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that while animal-based protein may have advantages during infancy and childhood, plant-based protein has a more positive influence later in life and may help you live longer. Eating more plant-based foods has many health advantages, including a reduced risk of cancer, heart disease and diabetes.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You don’t have to become vegan or vegetarian to enjoy the benefits that eating more plants has to offer. Start with just one snack a day or one meal a week, and gradually go up from there. Look for easy, creative ways to add plant proteins to foods you already eat—add a handful of walnuts and chia seeds to your oatmeal, make a veggie sandwich with cheese and hummus spread on whole-grain bread or swap out the meat in your soup for protein-rich beans. Before long, you’ll realize that plants have become a regular part of your meal pattern.&lt;br&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent study published in &lt;em&gt;Food Chemistry: Molecular Sciences&lt;/em&gt;, researchers at the University of Mississippi center found that cinnamaldehyde -- a primary component of cinnamon -- activates receptors that control the metabolic clearance of medication from the body, meaning consuming large amounts of cinnamon could reduce the effects of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Health concerns could arise if excessive amounts of supplements are consumed without the knowledge of health care provider or prescriber of the medications," said Shabana Khan, a principal scientist in the center. "Overconsumption of supplements could lead to a rapid clearance of the prescription medicine from the body, and that could result in making the medicine less effective."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from its culinary uses, cinnamon has a long history of being used in traditional medicine and can help manage blood sugar and heart health and reduce inflammation. But how the product actually functions in the body remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprinkling cinnamon on your morning coffee is unlikely to cause an issue, but using highly concentrated cinnamon as a dietary supplement might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Despite its vast uses, very few reports were available to describe the fate of its major component -- cinnamaldehyde," Khan said. "Understanding its bioaccessibility, metabolism and interaction with xenobiotic receptors was important to evaluate how excess intake of cinnamon would affect the prescription drugs if taken at the same time."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all cinnamon is equal. Cinnamon oil -- which is commonly used topically as an antifungal or antibacterial and as a flavoring agent in food and drinks -- presents almost no risk of herb-drug interactions, said Amar Chittiboyina, the center's associate director.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But cinnamon bark -- especially Cassia cinnamon, a cheaper variety of cinnamon that originates in southern China -- contains high levels of coumarin, a blood thinner, compared to other cinnamon varieties. Ground Cassia cinnamon bark is what is normally found in grocery stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In contrast, true cinnamon from Sri Lanka carries a lower risk due to its reduced coumarin content," he said. "Coumarin's anticoagulant properties can be hazardous for individuals on blood thinners."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to fully understand the role that cinnamon plays in the body and what potential herb-drug interactions may occur, said Bill Gurley, a principal scientist in the center and co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We know there's a potential for cinnamaldehyde to activate these receptors that can pose a risk for drug interactions," he said. "That's what could happen, but we won't know exactly what will happen until we do a clinical study."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until those studies are complete, the researchers recommend anyone interested in using cinnamon as a dietary supplement to check with their doctor first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"People who suffer from chronic diseases -- like hypertension, diabetes, cancer, arthritis, asthma, obesity, HIV, AIDS or depression -- should be cautious when using cinnamon or any other supplements," Khan said. "Our best advice is to talk to a health care provider before using any supplements along with the prescription medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By definition, supplements are not meant to treat, cure or mitigate any disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work is based on material supported in part by the United States Department of Agriculture Specific Cooperative Agreement No. 58-6060-6-015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Aedes aegypti mosquito was detected in the Santa Teresa neighborhood of South San Jose, where two adult mosquitoes were trapped — meaning that the species survived the winter after they were found last year, county public health officials said at a news conference Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This mosquito is tiny, but it has a massive impact to the community and the health of our community,” said Edgar Nolasco, director of the County of Santa Clara Consumer and Environmental Protection Agency. “There’s a day-biting mosquito, highly aggressive in nature and it has the capability of transmitting diseases such as Zika, chikungunya, dengue and yellow fever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The return of the mosquitoes marks an “inflection point” of whether the pest will be able to remain in the community and spread disease, said Dr. Sarah Rudman, acting health officer and director of the Public Health Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the county &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/11/14/invasive-mosquitoes-found-in-six-places-in-santa-clara-county/"&gt;trapped 388 invasive mosquitoes in six locations&lt;/a&gt; in San Jose, Santa Clara and Gilroy, officials said in a press release. The mosquitoes, which originated in Africa and can also be found in South America, are about a quarter-inch in size and have black and white stripes on their backs and legs. They generally only travel within 500 feet of where they hatch, and they feed “almost exclusively” on humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The species has &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/04/17/how-orange-county-plans-to-sterilize-mosquitos-to-limit-pests-spread-of-disease/"&gt;become established — meaning it has a self-sustaining population — in 22 counties&lt;/a&gt; across California, primarily in the southern and central parts of the state, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to combat the species’ continuing presence, the county is increasing its monitoring and surveillance team, putting more traps in areas where the mosquitoes are spotted, increasing community outreach and conducting more door to door inspections, said Dr. Nayer Zahiri, manager of the Vector Control District. She added that the county is also working with other vector control districts that are dealing with the same invasive mosquito.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The threat of this dangerous mosquito is growing,” Zahiri said. “This is the second year in a row we have found the day-biting mosquito in the Santa Teresa neighborhood of South San Jose.”&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Zahiri added that the fact that the mosquitoes have been found for a second year in a row “means it is becoming more likely that this mosquito is here to stay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rudman added that the risk of someone in Santa Clara County contracting an illness like Zika or dengue fever from a mosquito is still “effectively zero” because the mosquito would first have to bite someone who carried the disease. But she noted that the number of people contracting these diseases outside of the county then returning has increased: in 2020, seven cases of dengue traveled into the county, but in 2024, that number rose to almost 50 cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s changing now is if this invasive mosquito becomes endemic here, eventually these diseases will spread here at home, causing severe risk, including risk of death to certain populations,” Rudman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nolasco said that the early detection of the invasive mosquitoes allows the county to possibly control their spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mosquitoes can breed in standing water, so public health officials are asking that county residents allow vector control technicians to provide free inspections and advice, Nolasco said. Residents should report any mosquitoes they see, and they should ensure that they dump, drain and clean any containers with standing water in yards, Zahiri said. The county’s emergency alert system will also send out notifications about mosquito sightings and treatements happening in specific neighborhoods, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To effectively clean out containers that held standing water, officials recommend scrubbing them with hot, soapy water or a diluted bleach solution, according to a press release from the Vector Control District. The eggs appear like tiny bits of dirt to the naked eye and are about half a millimeter in size. Outdoor water containers that should be cleaned include bird baths and pet dishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The community is our first line of defense,” Nolasco said. “Let’s protect our community, our health and our quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any sightings of day-biting mosquitoes should be reported to the Vector Control District at 408-918-4770 or &lt;a href="mailto:vectorinfo@cep.sccgov.org"&gt;vectorinfo@cep.sccgov.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bad habits like smoking, heavy drinking and lack of exercise start taking their toll at the age of 36, researchers have claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ditching unhealthy vices early in life was found to boost the odds of having a happy and healthy old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers tracked the health of hundreds of children born in 1959 until they were 61 and found those who consistently smoked, boozed and lounged around in their younger years ended up sicker and more depressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Crucially, their health started to decline at the age of 36.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our findings highlight the importance of tackling risky health behaviours as early as possible to prevent damage from building up over the years,' said Dr Tiia Kekäläinen, of Laurea University in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/finland/index.html" id="mol-9bd9e3a0-2125-11f0-b4ba-89b0fb9ed748"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Bad habits in youth culminate in poor mental and physical health later in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Heart disease and cancer cause almost three-quarters of deaths worldwide. But by following a healthy lifestyle, an individual can cut their risk of developing these illnesses and reduce their odds of an early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is never too late to change to healthier habits. Adopting healthier habits in midlife also has benefits for older age.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Health problems caused by poor lifestyle choices start to kick in at 36, researchers found&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lack of exercise was particularly linked to poor physical health, smoking was mainly linked to poor mental health and heavy alcohol consumption was associated with declines in both mental and physical health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The impact was greater for those who indulged in unhealthy habits over longer periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smoking causes lung cancer and heart and breathing problems, while a lack of exercise and too much alcohol may cause issues such as organ failure, cancer, stroke, heart attack and early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research has focused on how bad habits affect people during middle age. The new study, published in Annals of Medicine, followed people from a much younger age to work out when the rot sets in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers pointed out that bad habits and ill health are probably two-way — depression and physical problems may lead to drinking, smoking and immobility, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added the results are most applicable to people born in the late 1950s and early 60s. However, they may not be as relevant to younger generations, who may have different lifestyles and risky habits, such as vaping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other lifestyle factors that can have major health impacts, such as diet and drug use, were also not considered as factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
