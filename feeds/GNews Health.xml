&lt;p&gt;There has been a great deal of research into Helmholtz resonance in general, but according to Yicong Fu of Cornell University and co-authors, there has not been any significant attempt to cross-confirm that human hand claps serve as Helmholtz resonators. So they recruited 10 participants to clap into a microphone 20–30 times each for three different hand configurations: cupped, palm to palm, and palm to finger. They used baby powder to map the air flow produced by the clapping, along with measuring pressure and capturing the action on high-speed video. They also made soft polymer hand replicas designed to mimic the elasticity of human skin and used them to generate clapping sounds for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The recorded frequencies matched the predictions of the Helmholtz resonator model, confirming that hand claps function like a resonator, rather than being a solid collision sound. Frequency depended upon hand configuration: clapping with cupped hands, for instance, produced lower frequencies than clapping with palm to finger because the cupped configuration created a larger resonant cavity. Clapping faster produces a louder initial sound, while lower skin elasticity produces a longer-lasting sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, "Our work provided the first experimental support for the theoretical framework and improved the fundamental understanding of hand claps for broader application potentials," the authors concluded. Specifically, "These findings may facilitate low-cost acoustical diagnostics in architecture and enhance rhythmic sound patterns in music and language education." It might even be possible one day to identify someone based on their distinctive claps and use it as a kind of acoustic login for electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Dozens of the chicks – which spend 90 days in burrows before making their first journey – were examined by researchers from the University of Tasmania. Many had mistakenly been fed plastic waste by their parents and built up high levels of plastic in their stomachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Blood tests indicated that the plastic pollution had left the chicks with severe health issues, disrupting the stomach, liver, kidneys and brain, according to &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ads0834?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D20597589108928405310818161390203415780%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1741698511" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal Science Advances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Plastic ingestion in seabirds is nothing new.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="18" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm865srjc001w3b725nnsbnd0@published"&gt;“It’s the question du jour,” says William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm865srjc001x3b72d667lnez@published"&gt;It makes sense to worry: “Measles is not a trivial disease,” Schaffner reminds me. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2015/01/measles-outbreak-at-disney-anti-mmr-vaccine-activists-claim-disease-isnt-dangerous.html"&gt;Quite the opposite&lt;/a&gt;: Although measles, the most contagious virus on record, doesn’t have a &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; high mortality rate (1 to 3 in every 1,000 infected people will die), it sends &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/infectious-disease/measles/"&gt;20 percent of unvaccinated people to the hospital&lt;/a&gt;—and that number is higher for children under 5—with serious complications ranging from pneumonia to brain swelling. Basically, you are right to not be reassured by that mortality rate. “We shouldn’t only be talking about death,” says &lt;a href="https://www.unbiasedscience.com/about-us"&gt;Jess Steier&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of the public health data science consulting firm (and &lt;a href="https://www.unbiasedscience.com/podcast"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;em&gt;Unbiased Science&lt;/em&gt;. “We want to avoid infection at all costs.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="118" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm865srjc001y3b723xayt500@published"&gt;The good news is that we have an effective and safe vaccine that does exactly that: For most people, it &lt;em&gt;completely prevents&lt;/em&gt; infection (unlike, say, the flu vaccine, which may solely &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated"&gt;ease symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, not prevent you from getting the flu entirely). Thanks to the measles vaccine, usually called the MMR vaccine, in combination with mumps and rubella, the U.S. declared measles to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;be effectively eliminated&lt;/a&gt; in 2000. The reason it’s coming back is that people are unvaccinated. To reach herd immunity—enough of a population being immune that measles can no longer spread—about 95 percent of people need to be vaccinated. In the Texas community where the child died during the outbreak, the measles vaccination rate among kindergartners is 82 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm865srjd001z3b72hx360qro@published"&gt;If you are healthy, got two doses of MMR, and were born after 1989: you’re good. “The recommendation is, sit pretty,” says Steier. Two doses of MMR &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/should-you-get-a-measles-vaccine-booster#:~:text=No%20vaccine%20is%20100%25%20effective,97%25%20effective%20against%20rubella.)"&gt;provides lifetime protection&lt;/a&gt; for about 97 percent of people. (The other 3 percent may still get measles but will likely have milder symptoms and be less able to spread the virus than they would otherwise.) So if you were vaccinated after 1989, there’s absolutely no need to get a booster.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm865srjd00203b728nno2vvh@published"&gt;If you were born before 1957, you also don’t need to worry about vaccination. You were born at a time when measles still ran rampant, so you almost certainly had the virus as a kid and are now immune. It’s not the ideal way to get immunity, but congratulations! You have it.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm865srjd00213b722j0nav6h@published"&gt;If you were born between 1957 and 1989, you should pull out your vaccination records to review your history, says Schaffner. People born between 1957 and 1967 were getting vaccinated, but some received a version of the vaccine that was less effective than the one we use today. And many born between 1967 and 1989 got only one dose of MMR, which was the recommendation at the time but means they’re less likely to be &lt;em&gt;fully&lt;/em&gt; protected. If you received the less effective vaccine or got just one shot, it’s a good idea to get a booster vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm865srjd00223b72zmq5w2n3@published"&gt;Then there’s the other category: people who aren’t sure. Perhaps you can’t find your vaccination records, you were born &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; 1989, or you have no idea which version of the vaccine you got. If you really don’t know, the answer is simple. “Go into your health care provider, roll up your sleeve, and ask for a dose of MMR,” says Schaffner. (An exception is if you’re pregnant, in which case it’s recommended that you &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/02/28/can-you-get-the-measles-vaccine-while-pregnant/"&gt;wait to vaccinate&lt;/a&gt;.) Even if you don’t need another MMR dose, it won’t hurt to get the extra one.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="133" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm865srjd00233b72ftc7l9yo@published"&gt;Another key exception here is for people who &lt;a href="https://time.com/7266454/measles-outbreak-essay-ashish-jha/"&gt;are severely immunocompromised&lt;/a&gt;, such as cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. MMR is a live vaccine, and the worry is that it could replicate and cause illness if a recipient’s immune system is too weak. It’s also worth noting that people who were vaccinated before becoming immunocompromised may face reduced immunity. This population relies on herd immunity to stay safe from measles. That is why getting vaccinated is more than a &lt;a href="https://www.texaschildrens.org/content/wellness/vaccines-personal-choice-or-moral-responsibility"&gt;personal decision&lt;/a&gt;. And yet, worrying about our own personal health is one of the limited things we can do right now when it comes to the scary spread of measles: “While we can’t fully control our environment, we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; control our own immunization status,” writes infectious disease epidemiologist Nina Masters in her newsletter &lt;a href="https://knowyourvax.com/2025/02/21/measles-coming-to-a-city-near-you/?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;Know Your Vax&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="132" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm865srje00243b72n6q3buvf@published"&gt;You might have heard about a titer test, which looks at the amount of antibodies in a person’s blood in order to confirm that they are immune. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.cvs.com/minuteclinic/services/titers-and-immunity-testing"&gt;a common service&lt;/a&gt;, but in most cases, &lt;a href="https://www.southshorehealth.org/wellness/blog/do-adults-need-measles-titer-check"&gt;some experts argue&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re that unsure of your status for measles, you should just get a booster. Checking titers requires an extra doctor’s visit and extra expense, so it’s a hassle. Plus, titers don’t provide a complete picture of your immunity, says Steier. Even if your antibody levels come back low, you have what are called memory B cells, which could be helping to protect you—and because they don’t make much antibody, they won’t really show up on that test. If you feel as if you have to do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, skip the titers and get the booster.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm865srje00253b72h87mp80y@published"&gt;But unless you’re in the heart of an outbreak, don’t worry too much. “You don’t need to run to your practitioner,” says Schaffner. The next time you’re at the doctor, though, ask them to review your vaccination history. It’s always a good idea to make sure you’re fully &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;protected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Their ages and identities were not released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unvaccinated individual has been prescribed medication and is being quarantined, Kelly-McGovern said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our people will follow them and see if they develop symptoms," Kelly-McGovern said of the 12 individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who was at the hospital's pediatric emergency department on March 3 or 4, or "visited an inpatient child on the Medicine 3 unit" between March 3 and 6 could have been exposed to measles, according to the New York State Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suffolk health officials would not say whether the child who tested positive for measles is still hospitalized at Cohen's Medical Center, where they reside in the county or how they may have contracted the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child was unvaccinated, but did not attend day care or school while infectious, according to the Suffolk County Department of Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State health officials said the child had recently traveled "outside of the U.S."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials have declined to give the age of the infected child, other than to say they were under 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children under the age of one are not eligible to get the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2024, a child under 5 from Nassau County also was treated at Cohen's for measles. It wasn't clear how that child contracted the disease and they had not been traveling overseas, where measles is more common. The child recovered and was released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before that, the highest number of recent Long Island measles cases was in 2019, when there were three in Nassau and one in Suffolk, according to state health department data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check back for updates on this developing story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;span class="author-image Byline_author-image__kHthS"&gt;&lt;img alt="Robert Brodsky" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AYmE4NjQ0OGItOGQ0NC00%3AOGItOGQ0NC00OWU5YmIw%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=96&amp;amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AYmE4NjQ0OGItOGQ0NC00%3AOGItOGQ0NC00OWU5YmIw%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=256&amp;amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AYmE4NjQ0OGItOGQ0NC00%3AOGItOGQ0NC00OWU5YmIw%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=256&amp;amp;q=75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Last year, 14 people in New York City were &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-02-27_measles.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;diagnosed with the illness&lt;/a&gt;, with an additional case elsewhere in New York State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But an unfolding outbreak of the disease in West Texas and New Mexico has cast a spotlight on measles, which is highly contagious and can prove deadly and is sometimes heralded by a rash. That outbreak has emerged at the same time that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist who &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/health/texas-measles-outbreak-kennedy.html" title=""&gt;advocates unconventional treatments&lt;/a&gt;, has become President Trump’s secretary of health and human services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;With measles so much in the news, residents of New York and New Jersey might be feeling concerned. Here’s what to know about the cases in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-13o6u42 eoo0vm40" id="link-1d3d1d2b"&gt;Should I be concerned about the local cases?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;None of the three patients in New York State, two of whom live in New York City, had been vaccinated against measles and the cases are not related, according to the city’s health department. The first case was reported in January, the second in February and the third in mid-March. The first two patients have recovered and the third, an unvaccinated child under 5 years old from Suffolk County, was being treated at Cohen Children’s Medical Center in Queens, the &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-03-11_measles.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;state’s Department of Health said&lt;/a&gt; on March 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In New Jersey, all three people with confirmed cases of measles this year were not vaccinated against the virus. A person from Bergen County who had traveled internationally was the first of the three patients to be diagnosed, on Feb. 14, according to the state’s Health Department. Two people who had been in close contact with the first patient were diagnosed nearly a week later and were quarantined to minimize the chances of spreading the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

under the age of eight should avoid consuming slushy ice &lt;a href="/topic/drinks"&gt;drinks&lt;/a&gt; containing the sweetening agent glycerol, researchers suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of youngsters have become unwell as a result of so-called “glycerol intoxication syndrome”, which caused &lt;a href="/topic/symptoms"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; like decreased consciousness and low blood sugar, according to a study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glycerol is a naturally occurring alcohol and sugar substitute which helps slush drinks maintain their texture by preventing liquid from freezing solid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, slush drinks – also known as slushies – containing the ingredient are not recommended for &lt;a href="/topic/children"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt;

looked at the medical notes of 21 &lt;a href="/topic/children"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt; in the UK and Ireland who fell ill after consuming a slushie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most cases took place between 2018 and 2024, with children’s ages ranging between two and almost seven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The youngsters were initially diagnosed with hypoglycaemia, or low blood sugar, after arriving at emergency departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers suggest drinking slushies containing glycerol “may cause a clinical syndrome of glycerol intoxication in young children”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms included decreased consciousness, hypoglycaemia, lactic acidosis, which occurs when the body produces too much lactic acid, and hypokalaemia, or low potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They added: “Clinicians and parents should be alert to the phenomenon, and public health bodies should ensure clear messaging regarding the fact that younger children, especially those under eight years of age, should avoid slush ice drinks containing glycerol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Food Standards Agency (FSA) advises against children under four consuming slush ice drinks containing glycerol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also recommends consumption is limited to no more than one slush per day for children aged between five and 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time between drinking the slushie and becoming ill was known for 15 children, with 14 becoming unwell within an hour, according to the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All 21 children recovered quickly and were discharged with advice not to drink slushies, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the group, 20 children followed this advice and had no further episodes of low blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, one child had another slushie at the age of seven and developed symptoms within an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers said: “There is poor transparency around slush ice drink glycerol concentration; estimating a safe dose is therefore not easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is also likely that speed and dose of ingestion, along with other aspects such as whether the drink is consumed alongside a meal or during a fasting state, or consumed after high-intensity exercise, may be contributing factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They added that “there are no nutritional or health benefits from these drinks” and “they are not recommended as part of a balanced diet”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Recommendations on their safe consumption therefore need to be weighted towards safety,” academics said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To ensure safe population-level recommendations can be easily interpreted at the individual parental level, and given the variability across an age cohort of weight, we suggest that recommendations should be based on weight rather than age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alternatively, the recommended age threshold may need to be higher (eight years), to ensure the dose per weight would not be exceeded given normal population variation in weight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 16:34:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxQOE1tUjdaVU9ncnJOenBwYkRLVmQySW1WbmlrSEUyalJUZTRtbTVkZV9YVEQ4T2tVWmJzVmZJNmxXUFI1bjhUNGFNcE1laXlFMVlEOGNBX1puT1l3cVFIdnJHUHRBeEtUTUxwbEVTSjFQSFJqWmg2TmZEa3pPVXBJYktBSlpGa3g4SXViYUxrMklFSFFhblRUV0Y0RHJ5N0VNRVVuejVWNmFUaDEzUmNFSzNkY0lpYlZPWTVydThoLVJwYTlUOWtjUg</guid></item><item><title>12 people identified as possibly exposed to measles after infant from Suffolk County tests positive - News 12 Long Island</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxNdnNUZEFHMmNKRUJWOFkwOEs0cFpVV1RPWVdfZ2EydFRxbkVoYS1wUkNIamFDa05rOGhLUHotSl9PcERlSUhnSzNXOFFYQktiUGozUFJvLXh0bHMwR3MwUHFKX05PZExsR0hiRFN1dHRacVR3OTZEeDVIeDJyc0cxR2ZZWmNWdklEYWJGd1h0a2U5bl9JQ2tSUjR5WV8xd3VOX0NN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div alignitems="normal" justifycontent="normal" direction="column" gap="1rem,1.25rem" flexwrap="nowrap" class="sc-fsYfdN hQgjIe sc-1348a9b4-0 lhdfiP"&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Suffolk County Health Commissioner Dr. Gregson Pigott said the child who was infected was less than a year old and not eligible to get the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) Vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Health officials believe the child got it while traveling but the source of the infection is still under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;The child was discharged from the hospital and is recovering at home, according to county health officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;This is the third case of measles in the state this year and the first outside of New York City. State health officials said there is no connection between this case and other outbreaks in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Pigott said Suffolk County's high vaccination rate against measles makes it unlikely the virus will spread to others in the community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;According to data from the state health department, 82.6% of Suffolk County children have received at least one MMR shot by 2 years of age as of Jan. 1, 2025. That number is slightly higher than the overall state average of 81.2%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Officials are working to contact trace for any additional potential exposures to people who visited the pediatric emergency department at Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park from March 3 to March 4 or visited an inpatient child on the Medicine 3 unit from March 3 to March 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Cohen Children's Medical Center is contacting patients who visited these areas at the time of potential exposure and has identified patients who are at high risk and may require timely treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;A spokesperson for Cohen Children's Hospital said in a statement to News 12:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="left"&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"A pediatric patient was diagnosed with measles and treated at Cohen Children's Medical Center. We are actively working with public health officials under established exposure protocols to ensure no further cases arise from this incident. The situation underscores the critical importance of vaccinations, including the MMR vaccine, and the need for them to help prevent diseases like measles and minimize the risk of spreading these diseases."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;The Suffolk County Department of Health has confirmed the child with measles did not attend daycare or school while infectious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by a virus that is spread by coughing or sneezing into the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Individuals can catch the virus by breathing it in, or by touching a contaminated surface, then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. Complications may include pneumonia, encephalitis, miscarriage, preterm birth, hospitalization and death.

	The incubation period for measles is up to 21 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;People who are exposed to measles and have not been previously vaccinated should quarantine for 21 days after exposure. People who were exposed but who have been vaccinated with MMR do not need to quarantine but should self-monitor for 21 days and stay home if they develop symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;People diagnosed with measles should isolate until four days after the rash appears.

	Symptoms can include high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. Three to five days after symptoms begin, a rash of red, flat spots appears on the face and then spreads to the rest of the body.

	A person with measles can pass it to others as soon as four days before a rash appears and as late as four days after the rash appears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Typically, the first dose of the MMR vaccine is given to kids between 12 to 15 months old and the second dose is given between four and six years old as the child heads to school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;According to the CDC, one MMR vaccine is about 93% effective at preventing measles and two doses are about 97% effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News 12 Long Island</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 16:18:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxNdnNUZEFHMmNKRUJWOFkwOEs0cFpVV1RPWVdfZ2EydFRxbkVoYS1wUkNIamFDa05rOGhLUHotSl9PcERlSUhnSzNXOFFYQktiUGozUFJvLXh0bHMwR3MwUHFKX05PZExsR0hiRFN1dHRacVR3OTZEeDVIeDJyc0cxR2ZZWmNWdklEYWJGd1h0a2U5bl9JQ2tSUjR5WV8xd3VOX0NN</guid></item><item><title>My body exploded with sores after breakthrough measles infection... why even the vaccinated should be worried - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxPRWJMWnFVRzVQX2ZtaFJRMmZCRWswWl84RzRKM1J2OHpQclpQMjNMdC1JZDQtM1M3ZGtDWmZNZzFsZk5UUmVrUkhIal9ZS1BQZTBnZ0lXUWJ0TTN4LWN3eUc4QS04MzFMUW45RUI1bk50VkZMWFVJclE1U1g0UUlkUjZScUVDbFExbzB2dVR5YjNIbnJkNm55TnV4X0NpYlVu0gGmAUFVX3lxTE1zb0JXeTJSMFc1ZlI5TDlNQ3lzMTkyNVJ4bHh1SDNIbkJWT1RSQzRnVUVhZUJadHhRWENNdHptUHpIaEFpekhMdmFLSVcxUnFxOFp0WHZuVmMtQVFzczJTVTd3eUpSd24zTFg2ZVRVbHFraFQxT3RLZW9kNTJ5VkFyMmNyV2xTZ1JYeXJzNUVpMG9tODVFWUhHYWZMeFFvQ3JtQmlja3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A woman who caught measles and suffered its brutal symptoms despite being vaccinated has issued a warning over the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The childhood MMR vaccine is 97 percent effective at stopping transmission, but measles is&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14087169/cdc-warns-trump-measles-vaccine-decline-rfjk-jr-health.html"&gt; so infectious&lt;/a&gt; it can still cause breakthrough infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marcy, a teacher from Ontario, was exposed when one of her unvaccinated students came to school with the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The child fell sick and after diagnosis, health officials told Marcy and her class to isolate for up to 21 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marcy said she had been doubled-vaccinated as a child and received a booster after she was exposed, but over the next six days, she developed a fever that continued to worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then the charac&lt;span&gt;teristic rash came. It erupted all over her face, and spread down her neck to her back, arms and legs — covering them in bright red spots.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had a booster, and I still developed the infection — in fact I started to get a fever six days after my booster,' Marcy said on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Marcy, pictured above, developed the measles after being exposed to an infected unvaccinated child in the school where she worked in Ontario, Canada&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I got a mild fever at first, and then it got worse and worse, instead of getting better, which should have been the first clue.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It comes amid a major outbreak in Texas, where more than 250 people have been infected while at least 29 have been hospitalized and two are reported to have died.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of the patients, just five (or 2 percent) were vaccinated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And an outbreak in Ontario that has sickened at least 177 people, mostly children at the state's schools. Marcy is a patient in this outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of these patients, just eight were vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine prevents infections in the vast majority of cases, but the CDC says online that about three in 100 people who receive the vaccine could still be infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These patients tend to suffer a more mild infection, however, and avoid the worst effects of measles including encephalitis, or brain swelling, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marcy, who revealed her case on &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@marcyteaches/video/7472085787752893751"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, said that she had received two doses of the MMR vaccine as a child — which are administered at the ages of 12 months and four to six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But blood tests in the hospital revealed she had no antibodies against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Normally, people who are fully vaccinated against measles will have antibodies in their blood, although in some cases these may not be picked up in tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physicians gave her a booster dose against measles and discharged her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is possible for immunity from the vaccine to wane over time, particularly in patients who are immunocompromised. It is not clear whether Marcy had any underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Revealing her diagnosis online, she said: 'Hello, so I have, the measles', before gesturing to her rash-covered face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Marcy is pictured above attending Taylor Swift's Eras tour more than a month before she was diagnosed with the disease. There is no risk that she could have been infected at the time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added in a comment: 'I was vaccinated as a child but my [tests] showed no evidence of immunity. They recommended a booster.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marcy said doctors initially thought her temperature was caused by the norovirus, before the rash erupted — leading to a measles diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She didn't feel the rash appear, but said that after a few days it started to itch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I developed a rash without even feeling it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was at home, minding my business, and then my husband came home and took a look at my face and said, "What the heck happened to your face?!".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And I looked in the mirror and it's got a little worse, I am hoping the rash starts to get better tomorrow.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Taylor Swift super-fan is pictured above before she was diagnosed with the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rash lasted for about five days before clearing, she said in the clip that was posted in mid-February and has been viewed nearly 20,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was able to return to work five days after her rash appeared, which is when someone is no longer infectious for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But said she was frequently exhausted and would come home from work and sleep immediately every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vaccination rates against measles have fallen in recent years amid false claims that the vaccine causes autism and mandates for Covid shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Ontario, only about 90 percent of residents have been vaccinated against measles — statistics suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While in Gaines County, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-70ca0170-ff53-11ef-b1d6-0fa43b4ed9bd"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, at the center of America's latest outbreak, only about 82 percent of people have been vaccinated against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 16:03:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPRWJMWnFVRzVQX2ZtaFJRMmZCRWswWl84RzRKM1J2OHpQclpQMjNMdC1JZDQtM1M3ZGtDWmZNZzFsZk5UUmVrUkhIal9ZS1BQZTBnZ0lXUWJ0TTN4LWN3eUc4QS04MzFMUW45RUI1bk50VkZMWFVJclE1U1g0UUlkUjZScUVDbFExbzB2dVR5YjNIbnJkNm55TnV4X0NpYlVu0gGmAUFVX3lxTE1zb0JXeTJSMFc1ZlI5TDlNQ3lzMTkyNVJ4bHh1SDNIbkJWT1RSQzRnVUVhZUJadHhRWENNdHptUHpIaEFpekhMdmFLSVcxUnFxOFp0WHZuVmMtQVFzczJTVTd3eUpSd24zTFg2ZVRVbHFraFQxT3RLZW9kNTJ5VkFyMmNyV2xTZ1JYeXJzNUVpMG9tODVFWUhHYWZMeFFvQ3JtQmlja3c</guid></item><item><title>Ozempic users say their exes are attempting to reconnect with them after weight loss: 'Second chance at love' - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi4AFBVV95cUxORlg1dkFfSVZXRWp6ZkR1VnhLelpUclJIR3V5aldPa3NjZzBmMTNQSUdDaHYyM0dVZU9xX2hhX2c3YlZmYnVKekluOGZfRTB4dzFXSnZrTUtpdXRPUXhTX2xZdXF2WFFYYjZzQ19GY3lMTkkxMTY1U1FoUGExOFI0dXBRbmoxSFlYckEzVVJVRjZybWxXRGpLWUVYQ0t4RFlFQUM4MVFOUl9BZlcyX2hJa0pwTC1OS0ZXS0kxTnhiUEVsZGVwU0J6Z0Nab0xnX2N4emdaQnJzYmVIUFN0MkZxVg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;It’s an unexpected Ozempic side effect. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Slimmed-down users of GLP-1 drugs say their exes have started sliding into their DMs &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.ziphealth.co/how-are-glp1s-impacting-relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;A recent survey by ZipHealth&lt;/a&gt;, which polled 1,000 individuals using Ozempic, Mounjaro and other similar treatments, found that one in five found former flames reaching out to re-connect. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;One in five users found that former flames — exes or crushes — reached out to reconnect, especially Gen Z and millennial users.

 &lt;span class="credit"&gt;dodotone – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The survey found that women on Ozempic were more likely to experience a blast from the past than male users of the same drug. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, nearly one-quarter of single surveyed Ozempic users reported receiving more matches or unsolicited messages on dating apps since starting their GLP-1 regimen.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;This influx of interest helped one in 10 single users enter a new romantic relationship after shedding some pounds. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;One in 10 single users enter a new romantic relationship after shedding some pounds. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Nebojsa – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These changes convinced nearly half of GLP-1 users that these medications gave them a “second chance” at love.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The drugs helped them shed more than just weight — it also helped them shake off shame and anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Half of those surveyed reported feeling more confident after starting the medication, with women being 12% more likely than men to experience this boost. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This confidence extended to all corners of their lives, including the bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;These changes convinced nearly half of GLP-1 users that these medications gave them a “second chance” at love.

 &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Zip Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Half of GLP-1 users also found themselves feeling friskier and more adventurous in the bedroom, with one in five even exploring new sexual positions since their weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s because they’re not just looking good; they’re feeling good. While people’s weight decreased, their libido increased — 39% of millennials, 37% of Gen Z and 35% of Gen X. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, men reported a stronger uptick in libido (40%) than women (35%), although &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/04/26/lifestyle/ozempic-allegedly-causing-embarrassing-sexual-side-effect/"&gt;others have complained of having the opposite reaction&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some users experienced a negative impact on their romantic relationships, with one in 10 respondents reporting that their weight loss transformation led to jealousy or insecurity from their partners. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But more often than not, these medications changed people’s relationships for the better. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About four in five GLP-1 users in relationships said they noticed improved emotional intimacy with their partners.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;However, with all these emotional and sexual benefits, the majority of people felt they had to keep the weight off to appease others. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;But more often than not, these medications changed people’s relationships for the better.

 &lt;span class="credit"&gt;millaf – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nearly three in five users felt they had to maintain their weight loss out of fear of judgment or losing this newfound attention — a pressure felt stronger by women (64%) and Gen Xers (60%).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/08/health/people-going-blind-after-using-weight-loss-drugs-like-ozempic-and-mounjaro/"&gt;going blind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/13/health/woman-suffers-life-threatening-bowel-injury-from-ozempic-suit/"&gt;suffering from life-long diarrhea&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/13/health/ozempic-cuts-booze-cravings-in-people-with-alcohol-use-disorder-study/"&gt;battling addiction&lt;/a&gt; and finding love, people who take Ozempic and other GLP-1 medications are seeing that the drugs are doing more than reshaping bodies; they’re reshaping lives — for better or worse. &lt;/p&gt;

But experts say that even with more than 250 cases reported across the three states, the outbreak is likely much larger.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My gut tells me there are cases that are unreported — you don’t have to come in and get tested for measles,” said Katherine Wells, the director of public health in Lubbock, a Texas city on the edge of the outbreak where some sick children have been taken to be hospitalized. “It’s going to be a long process to get everything measles-free again in this area, but I can’t tell you if that’s 500 cases or a thousand.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health officials and other experts believe they are capturing only a fraction of cases for reasons that have to do with the epidemiology of the outbreak as well as reports of a lack of cooperation among some people in the areas where cases have been detected. But a large part of it is simple math.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Texas officials reported last month that &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/26/texas-measles-outbreak-death/"&gt;an unvaccinated child had died of measles&lt;/a&gt;, the country’s first measles death in a decade. In New Mexico, health authorities are investigating &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/06/new-mexico-adult-with-measles-dies/"&gt;another possible measles fatality&lt;/a&gt;, an unvaccinated person who tested positive for the virus after death. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fatality rate for measles is roughly one — perhaps up to three — in every 1,000 cases. Even just the first death put experts on alert that the spread of the virus could be much wider than documented. In 2019, for example, the U.S. reported more than 1,200 confirmed measles cases, largely driven by an outbreak in and around New York City, but no deaths. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That was the number one flag that this could be greatly underreported,” said Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist who has been tracking the outbreak in&lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/measles-outbreak-grows-hantavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; her Your Local Epidemiologist newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In theory, even if the second death is confirmed as having been caused by measles, two deaths in just a couple hundred cases is possible. But statistically, experts would only anticipate two measles deaths to occur in the U.S. with many, many more cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These two individuals could just be incredibly unlucky,” Jetelina said. “It’s just surprising, particularly given how few deaths we’ve had over the past 10 years.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During measles outbreaks, experts know they’re going to miss cases. But they have an advantage in detecting measles versus other viral infections; measles is accompanied by a telltale rash, meaning parents of sick children are more likely to take them to doctors than they would if they had the flu or Covid. There they would likely get tested. Measles is also a reportable disease, meaning health officials get notified of positive cases. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But in Texas, there have been&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/03/texas-measles-outbreak-death-family/681985/?utm_campaign=morning_rounds&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9woKZxOjj5meGdY96Nwl46YecFd36589WhE6XqIP2hew1B3zLnbzGAkT8YP-Xr1Na48rYIaC4DiM_XTyiT-ASwoV3Bzg&amp;amp;_hsmi=351385696&amp;amp;utm_content=351385696&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; anecdotal reports that people have resisted&lt;/a&gt; efforts to expand testing. In part because of increased frustration with public health since the Covid-19 pandemic, people aren’t as willing to cooperate with case investigations. Some of the same distrust issues that have reduced vaccine uptake in recent years may also contribute to an unwillingness to seek testing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts have noted that some measles patients who have shown up at hospitals have been extremely sick, which suggests that some people are not seeking care unless it becomes an emergency — infections that might have been otherwise documented if people went to a doctor. The person who died in New Mexico never sought medical care at all. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are also logistical issues. The outbreak is playing out across a very rural stretch of Texas, and while state and local officials have, with federal support, expanded testing access and started another lab in Lubbock to run tests, people might still have to travel extremely far to seek a test. At this point in the outbreak, the publicity around it may have convinced people who are infected but not sick enough to need medical care to just ride out their infection at home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think people know what they’re dealing with because there’s so much information in the news,” Wells said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That might be especially true among adults who are infected. While the majority of cases in Texas are among kids, 38 adults have been confirmed to have measles. In New Mexico, the cases have mostly been documented in adults. The sizable number of adult cases &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/08/02/adult-measles-infection/"&gt;reflects a shift in the spread of measles&lt;/a&gt;, which used to almost always strike in childhood. But now, the kids whose parents avoided vaccination in the 1990s and 2000s have become adults themselves, adding to the pool of people who act as kindling to outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In Texas, more than half of the 223 confirmed cases as of Tuesday have been identified in Gaines County, and many have been tied to a Mennonite community there with low vaccine uptake. But cases have also been reported in counties south of Gaines and all the way north to Dallam County, on the Oklahoma border, a stretch of some 300 miles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Oklahoma officials also reported two probable measles cases, based on the people’s symptoms and their exposure to cases in the Texas and New Mexico outbreak. State health officials said the two people realized they had been exposed and stayed home through their infectious periods, suggesting they had prevented onward spread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health officials say that even if they miss some cases, the more infections they can track, the better they can get their arms around an outbreak. With stronger surveillance, they can know where to surge additional testing and expand outreach with vaccination, the best approach to safely corralling outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The outbreak has also taken on a political dimension. &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;During a Tuesday interview &lt;/a&gt;with health secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/27/trump-administration-measles-outbreak-response-breaks-with-past/"&gt;has downplayed the severity of the outbreak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/03/rfk-jr-vaccine-skepticism-on-view-in-texas-measles-outbreak-response/"&gt;also undersold the importance of vaccination&lt;/a&gt; to ending it, Fox News’ Sean Hannity referred to the measles outbreak as “relatively small.” Kennedy, reiterating comments he’s made earlier about the outbreak, also noted that there are multiple measles outbreaks every year. (An outbreak is defined only as three or more connected cases, and most only result in a small number of infections.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jane Zucker, formerly the assistant commissioner of New York City’s health department, said she started to notice a shift in some people’s willingness to get tested during the 2018-2019 measles outbreak there. Typically during an outbreak, with heightened awareness of the virus, people want to confirm that what they’re sick with is measles. But during the New York outbreak, Zucker said, “a lot of those rules were really broken.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As she and colleagues&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514?logout=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; wrote&lt;/a&gt; in the New England Journal of Medicine, the health department only learned about some infections “several weeks to months” later, when parents would bring kids in for serologic testing — a blood test that can show that someone has immunity to a virus, either from vaccination or a prior infection — so that the kids could get back to school. (Unvaccinated children were only allowed at schools if they could demonstrate they had recovered from an infection.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As they wrote, “delayed identification of measles in these situations hindered the ability of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to implement real-time control measures.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	As a major &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/measles/" id="auto-tag_measles" data-tag="measles"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; outbreak spreads out of West Texas &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/11/health/measles-outbreak-texas-oklahoma-new-mexico/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;into other states&lt;/a&gt;, Health Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" id="auto-tag_robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-tag="robert-f-kennedy-jr"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; continues to spread a confusing message about vaccine safety. In an interview with Fox News that aired on Tuesday, Kennedy touted the vaccine — but also suggested that the best way to get lifetime immunity from the measles is to simply become infected with measles, and that the measles vaccine is dangerous to those who take it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“It used to be — when you and I were kids — that everybody got measles. And the measles gave you lifetime protection against measles infection. The vaccine doesn’t do that,” Kennedy &lt;a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1899636733693554878" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;told Sean Hannity&lt;/a&gt; from inside the Steak &amp;amp; Shake fast food restaurant where the interview was conducted. “The vaccine is effective for some people for life, for many people it wanes.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;CDC estimates&lt;/a&gt; that 1-3 of every 1,000 childhood measles infections would result in death due to respiratory or neurological complications from the highly virulent disease. Measles was declared eradicated in the United States in 2000 after the implementation of a successful, two-dose national vaccination campaign that lasted decades. Until recently, measles cases detected in the United States nearly always originated from foreign travel.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is incredibly effective, and incredibly safe. Two doses in early childhood are 97 percent effective against measles, according to the CDC, and complications are extremely rare. However, if you ask our nation’s health secretary — a known vaccine skeptic — taking the MMR vaccine could be just as risky as catching a deadly infection. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year. It causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes — encephalitis, blindness, et cetera,” Kennedy &lt;a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1899637162817036510" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Hannity. “So people ought to be able to make that choice for themselves.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“One of the problems is that [the vaccine] does not appear to provide maternal immunity,” Kennedy said. “It used to be that very young kids […] they were protected by breast milk, and by maternal immunity. Women who get vaccinated do not provide that level of maternal immunity to the natural measles infection, so you’re now seeing measles hit very very young kids and hitting older people.”At one point Kennedy suggested that deaths attributed to measles in the past had been primarily caused by malnutrition and comorbidities. 

	&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Kennedy failed to mention that the majority of recent American measles outbreaks have been &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/30/increase-measles-cases-unvaccinated-vaccine-misinformation-cdc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;linked to communities&lt;/a&gt; where vaccination levels are dropping due to vaccine skepticism, or are below the rate needed to preserve social immunity. While breastfeeding women can temporarily pass along antibodies to their children through breast milk, the immunity benefits have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221003143" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;been found to wane&lt;/a&gt; before the child reaches their first birthday, and vaccination is still recommended for long-term protection. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The health secretary noted a commitment to “encourage” people to get vaccinated, but did so as an offhand comment amid another bout of fear mongering about the dangers of &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/vaccines/" id="auto-tag_vaccines" data-tag="vaccines"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt; — which are significantly less than those of a measles infection. 



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Kennedy’s handling of the measles outbreak in Texas has been blasted by lawmakers and public health officials. Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/rfk-jr-handling-west-texas-measles-outbreak-1235290478/"&gt;he took a hiking trip&lt;/a&gt; to the Coachella Valley as &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/hhs/" id="auto-tag_hhs" data-tag="hhs"&gt;HHS&lt;/a&gt; officials scrambled to bring the outbreak under control, and later pushed vitamin A as a way to combat the disease, despite health experts noting that vitamin A only helps when someone already has a vitamin A deficiency.. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Last month, during a meeting of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet, Kennedy asserted that measles outbreaks were “not unusual,” and &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/rfk-jr-measles-outbreak-texas-vaccines-1235281134/"&gt;downplayed the severity&lt;/a&gt; of the caseload. The Texas Department of Health the very same day confirmed the first measles death in the United States in over a decade. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;PHILADELPHIA—The Philadelphia Department of Public Health and Pennsylvania Department of Health are notifying the public of a potential measles exposure at the following locations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;South Philadelphia Health &amp;amp; Literacy Center
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This building includes CHOP Pediatric Primary Care South Philadelphia, Health Department Health Center #2, and the South Philadelphia Library, though there were no potential exposures in the library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1700 South Broad Street, Philadelphia, PA 19145&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friday, March 7, 2025, between 10:45 a.m. and 2:40 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday, March 8, 2025, between 9:05 a.m. and 1:20 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CHOP Emergency Department
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3401 Civic Center Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA, 19104&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monday, March 10, 2025, 7:55 a.m. to 10:15 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This measles case was exposed while traveling abroad and is not connected with the recent measles case identified in Montgomery County, or cases in other parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We believe there is no threat to the general public associated with this case of measles.” said &lt;strong&gt;Health Commissioner Dr. Palak Raval-Nelson&lt;/strong&gt;. “We know that this measles case is not associated with either the recent case in Montgomery County or the ongoing outbreak in Texas. As vaccination rates across the country continue to drop, there are more and more opportunities for people who cannot be vaccinated to be exposed to this deadly disease. That’s why it is critical for everyone who needs to be protected from measles to get vaccinated as soon as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Department Immunization Program Medical Director Dr. Mayssa Abuali&lt;/strong&gt; said, “The two-dose MMR vaccine series is 97 percent effective in preventing measles infections and confers lifelong protection. However, many places outside of the U.S., and increasingly within the U.S., do not have enough people vaccinated to prevent measles disease within communities. When traveling outside of the U.S. and to areas where there is an existing outbreak, travelers should talk to their healthcare provider about an early MMR vaccination for children aged 6-11 months and second doses for travelers at least two weeks before the trip.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a virus that spreads very easily from person to person among unvaccinated people. Anyone with measles can spread the virus to others who are not immune through direct contact with respiratory droplets, or through droplets in the air from coughing and sneezing. The early symptoms of measles are fever, runny nose, cough, and puffy eyes, followed by rash. Measles is contagious for 4 days before to 4 days after the rash starts. In some people, including infants and those with weakened immune systems, it can be a very serious infection that leads to pneumonia, brain infection, or death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who are not protected from measles but are exposed should quarantine, or stay at home away from others, for 21 days after the exposure. If someone who is quarantining due to measles must go out, they should wear a mask the entire time they are out. Wearing a mask won’t completely prevent spread, but it will help lower the chances of them spreading measles to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Health Department recommends the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you were potentially exposed at any of the previously listed locations during the indicated times, you should follow the instructions below to determine if you are protected (immune) from measles, and symptoms to look out for if you are not protected. If you were not in these buildings during those times, you do not need to follow these instructions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine if you are protected against measles. Generally, you are considered protected if you:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Were born before 1957,&lt;em&gt; or&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have already had measles, &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a blood test showing immunity to measles, &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have written documentation of adequate vaccines for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR vaccine)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at your vaccination records or ask your healthcare provider to see if you have already had the age-appropriate dose or doses of this vaccine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measles vaccine is routinely recommended for children 12–15 months old with a second dose given at age 4–6 years. Infants under 12 months are not routinely eligible for vaccine and are not protected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are protected from measles, you do not have to do anything. Measles vaccine is extremely effective at preventing measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are not protected from measles, there are things you can do to keep yourself and others safe.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you were at the CHOP Emergency Department on March 10 during the times listed above, you should receive a dose of MMR vaccine before Thursday, March 13. Talk to your healthcare provider to learn how you can get this vaccine. The Health Department has &lt;a href="https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphila.us12.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D48732a6251c09f25e0086d47a%26id%3D047c5fec3e%26e%3D5dc8f624ef&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Chans.kellner%40phila.gov%7C0450c002dd244a67844c08dd61721d56%7C2046864f68ea497daf34a6629a6cd700%7C0%7C0%7C638773864933454654%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=qbSTFPfL%2FuPoG1ukiXr1dwoTv42QB%2FZ72%2FvDzstr5lw%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0"&gt;additional resources on where to get vaccines on their website&lt;/a&gt;. If you do not receive an MMR vaccine, you will need to stay home for 21 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you were at the South Philadelphia Health &amp;amp; Literacy Center on March 7 during the times listed above, you should contact your healthcare provider and stay at home until Thursday, March 27. Contact your healthcare provider if you develop symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you were at the South Philadelphia Health &amp;amp; Literacy Center on March 8 during the times listed above, you should contact your healthcare provider and stay at home until Friday, March 28. Contact your healthcare provider if you develop symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are under 12 months of age, pregnant and not immune, or are immunosuppressed (have a weakened immune system) and were at any of the exposure locations, you should consult with your healthcare provider as soon as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you develop any measles-like symptoms through Monday, March 31, 2025, contact your doctor immediately. The early symptoms of measles are fever, runny nose, cough, and puffy eyes, followed by rash. Tell your doctor before visiting that you may have been exposed to measles. You should also notify the Philadelphia Department of Public Health by calling 215-685-6740, then pressing option 5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphia generally has very good MMR vaccine coverage rates. The Pennsylvania Department of Health recommends that at least 95 percent of people be fully vaccinated with the MMR vaccine to confer herd immunity, which protects residents who cannot be vaccinated due to age or a weakened immune system. During the 2023-2024 school year, the Pennsylvania Department of Health reported that 97.5 percent of 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade Philadelphia school students and 97.1 percent of 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade students were up-to-date on MMR vaccine. Philadelphia kindergarteners who were reported as up-to-date rose from 92.8% in 2022-2023 to 94.5% in 2023-2024.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three major US airports have already raised the alarm over measles this year, with alerts also being issued in &lt;a target="_self" class=""

target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14487651/texas-father-daughter-measles-death.html"&gt;amid a major outbreak &lt;/a&gt;of the disease in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-a8a70880-ff45-11ef-b1d6-0fa43b4ed9bd" class=""&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, which has already sickened more than 250 people and led to 29 hospitalizations and two deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The infection is spread via respiratory droplets expelled via coughs and sneezes that can hang in the air for up to two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infected patients first suffer from a fever, cough, runny nose and sore throat before developing the characteristic red rash that starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body, including the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After arriving on March 5, local health authorities said the patient visited Cloud 9 Nail Salon in North Hollywood between 11am and 5pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not clear whether the patient was vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On March 10 the patient went to Superior Grocery Store in El Monte from 8.15am to 10.30am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was not clear when the person first showed symptoms for measles or when their infection was diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After being diagnosed with the disease, however, patients are told to isolate and if symptoms become severe enough, they may be hospitalized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients are typically treated with painkillers, but may also receive antibiotics if they develop an associated infection or Vitamin A if they show signs of being malnourished. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In severe cases, they may also need assistance breathing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Muntu Davis, Los Angeles county's health officer, said: 'With measles outbreaks happening both in the United States and internationally, this recent case in our county highlights how important it is for anyone who has not been immunized to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Measles spreads easily through the air and on surfaces, and a person infected with measles can pass it on to other before they feel sick or have symptoms.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Young children and those who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems are at a higher risk for life-threatening complications from infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Getting the MMR vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and stop the spread of this dangerous disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two of the airport-linked measles patients have arrived in the US on China Airlines flights this year, while one has arrived on a Korean Air flight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The second case in Los Angeles is in a resident, while the first case was in a foreign traveler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are no reports suggesting an outbreak of measles in China or South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But late last month, officials in Ontario, Canada, also raised the alarm over measles after an infected passenger arrived in the area from South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike the US, measles has not been officially eradicated in China, which records low numbers of cases every year, but it was officially eradicated in South Korea in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US achieved measles elimination status in 2000, but cases have repeatedly emerged since — linked to passengers bringing in the virus from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over recent years, the vaccination rate against measles has dropped, however, amid Covid vaccination mandates and concerns over the safety of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The measles vaccine is 97 percent effective against the virus, which can cause death or leave patients with a life-long disability in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 14:29:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"

Inevitable, too, in a country where, as recently as 2001, 94 percent of Americans believed it was very or extremely important for parents to get their children vaccinated, but now, according to the Gallup Poll, &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648308/far-fewer-regard-childhood-vaccinations-important.aspx"&gt;only 69 percent say so&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IQZD7CDAGZCXPC4Z3IQMSLOV24" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If anyone in the country should be expected to sing the praises of the measles vaccine, it would be David Edmonston, 82, a retired home contractor in Bowling Green, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FPGDZXA3BBDYXB5ZZ5JZHWC5DY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The vaccine literally is named for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HPIXI24CWFD3VPYZ2TRO7SLBHU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The other day, after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

When Peebles and his colleague &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1954/enders/facts/"&gt;John Enders&lt;/a&gt;, in a hurry to develop a measles vaccine, learned of the outbreak at Fay, Peebles visited David and asked if he’d like to help the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZUDPISFYSVGRZM3QZNVRBVRLDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;David recalls giving blood samples and having his throat swabbed, as well as gargling something that tasted of sour milk. A few weeks later, Peebles returned to let David know that the samples had produced exactly what the scientists needed: the measles virus, which they planned to isolate and develop into a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2DMN57ID3RFCHBR3NOSDKLXSAY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The doctor offered David a steak dinner for his troubles, but he declined: “I wasn’t too keen on steak, so I said, ‘No, thanks,’” he recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7ERHI5QXNBAQBCJJRJBSVPKOLE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It took several years for the scientists to turn David’s virus sample into a vaccine and years to test its efficacy and safety, but when it finally was licensed in 1963, it was named for the boy whose illness made the advance possible: The Edmonston-B strain led to the Edmonston-Enders vaccine, a version of which is still used today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OWPFUY44JBDTVO2KUU67SITDN4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;CBS flew David from Washington to New York to appear on TV with the scientists to celebrate the vaccine, part of an extensive public health campaign that persuaded an overwhelming majority of parents to immunize their children — leading to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;elimination of measles&lt;/a&gt; from the country in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CWOAQD2JF5BBHM625Z2ISCQTPQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After college and a stint in the Deep South protesting with civil rights advocates, Edmonston settled into a life remodeling homes. He’d never had much interest in science, but he married a public health teacher, and when they had a son in 1980, they decided not to vaccinate him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="32V5AGO2UREWNOL37TEMG2D4QI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“My wife read an article that a researcher wrote, saying that the measles vaccine might give children a disease,” Edmonston said. “It was scary. My wife thought it was better not to vaccinate him. And I agreed to it: She was the mother, and had some public health training. He never did get vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BG3JC7PTNNG43M7NTE4K5QMBUQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Edmonston’s wife died two decades ago. He has lived for many years in a spiritual community based on Indian meditation, many of whose adherents, he says, are vaccination skeptics. Especially once the covid pandemic hit, he saw his friends “latch onto the idea that vaccines are dangerous,” he said, “and they became almost religious about it. I’ve struggled for years to understand why.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="F4AOGIO74VDYLODUSBXK7PFFCQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As people around him turned against vaccines, he read some of the science and pivoted the other way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KUCJOAHHW5DWVBWPVZF5VVURHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The more I thought about it, the more I returned to my feeling for the degree of intellectual honesty of the doctors I met all those years ago — their basic integrity,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZXFCZ2H25BENZEBBXJBHJJKP4I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;His vaccine-hesitant friends “are more willing to think in intuitive ways, rather than rational thinking,” Edmonston said. “I’ve lived in both those worlds. I’m by nature a more rational person, but I’ve become more intuitive in my work with this spiritual group. I still struggle with how to persuade people who are more intuitive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BM7VRJE3SJHJXD354WM4HVEKCU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A marshaling of facts doesn’t do the trick. Statistics showing that the measles vaccine has saved &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7345a4.htm"&gt;60 million lives&lt;/a&gt; in this century alone don’t persuade the resistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AR3T4VYCOVCYHE4NGKRSXTDEZU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And it doesn’t help to have authority figures such as Kennedy and Donald Trump, who &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/the-measles-book-childrens-health-defense-vaccine/"&gt;spread doubt&lt;/a&gt; about vaccines even as they sometimes claim to support them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JK4T2I3GWJBSBPLZDP6LU7W7GY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After Edmonston got the covid shots, he emailed his friends, urging them to protect their communities (to little effect).

The review team at University College Dublin, led by the consultant paediatrician Prof Ellen Crushell, called for health advice to be revised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;All but one of the cases took place between 2018 and 2024, with children’s ages ranging between two and almost seven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;All were initially diagnosed with hypoglycaemia, or low blood sugar, after arriving at emergency departments. The review team suggested drinking slushies containing glycerol “may cause a clinical syndrome of glycerol intoxication in young children”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Symptoms included decreased consciousness, hypoglycaemia, lactic acidosis, which occurs when the body produces too much lactic acid, and hypokalaemia, or low potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;They added: “Clinicians and parents should be alert to the phenomenon, and public health bodies should ensure clear messaging regarding the fact that younger children, especially those under eight years of age, should avoid slush ice drinks containing glycerol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The Food Standards Agency (FSA) advises against children under four consuming slush ice drinks containing glycerol. It also recommends consumption be limited to no more than one slush a day for children aged between five and 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The time between drinking the slushie and becoming ill was known for 15 children, with 14 becoming unwell within an hour, according to the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;All 21 children recovered quickly and were discharged with the advice not to drink slushies, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Of the group, 20 children followed this advice and had no further episodes of low blood sugar. But one child had another slushie at the age of seven and developed symptoms within an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The researchers said: “There is poor transparency around slush ice drink glycerol concentration; estimating a safe dose is therefore not easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It is also likely that speed and dose of ingestion, along with other aspects such as whether the drink is consumed alongside a meal or during a fasting state, or consumed after high-intensity exercise, may be contributing factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;They added that “there are no nutritional or health benefits from these drinks” and “they are not recommended as part of a balanced diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Recommendations on their safe consumption therefore need to be weighted towards safety,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“To ensure safe population-level recommendations can be easily interpreted at the individual parental level, and given the variability across an age cohort of weight, we suggest that recommendations should be based on weight rather than age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Alternatively, the recommended age threshold may need to be higher (eight years), to ensure the dose per weight would not be exceeded given normal population variation in weight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 14:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxPanZ2RWNBRFh3QUxRMEpjNVc0alZmNEV2ZmhhUUlXNnNhMnR5anhLMlIydHdhNWN3NVVWNzVrX1Q5MGJtRkhuODBKWnNua2FKaUJlX2ptUXh6cXNGR0RIZ0RVYnliU0h2MnA2UmU0VGNfd0pjcVhYamo2d2dKam1fMi1PQXFOd3VValEtVUs3Q3otUzl0ODlrVTIzWFhTdEpObXJQWmQwUTZaNkN1dVZlS0FYREtudXZTWEE</guid></item><item><title>Cher the cow and other herds face new threat as bird flu reaches Arizona cattle - AZ Luminaria</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxOMllNVXV1Q0w0Wm0xMkhmR1E0WGdaczRwWWdfY1U2RDh4QkpYVDhZNFp0Wjl4RjdfYjJObkFqUmhSSkp2akZoNjdtal9sV0wzelh2YWtpV3llVUNZRXFZUWFaTVJBWmozcWZaM3FuM2VMbTFoM0RiNVNGZmtjQVFqUDJNVnRqcWpndmlZaVVBYW1pVVl5RmhoVVEwWW91N2U4Uk02elJzSWxxMWduOWUxVEgzbXN0dw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;

		
		&lt;p&gt;Cher was giving Christina Brownlee kisses with her long, black and pink tongue. At well over 1,500 pounds, the cow — named Cher for her propensity to bellow, as well as maneuver to the front of a crowd — is part of a herd of cattle at University of Arizona’s campus agricultural center in the heart of Tucson.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brownlee, a professor at UA’s College of Veterinary Medicine, said she and other researchers refer to the cows living at the &lt;a href="https://experimentstation.arizona.edu/campus-agricultural-center"&gt;agricultural center&lt;/a&gt; as “grass puppies.” Cher and the other cows in the Tucson herd are neither beef nor dairy cows; rather, students training to be vets learn to care for and handle them. But Cher is still under threat: from a virus.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Symptoms of bird flu include: pink eye (conjunctivitis), fever, fatigue, cough, muscle aches, sore throat, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and stuffy or runny nose. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Learn &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/prevention/index.html"&gt;how to take precautions&lt;/a&gt; to protect against infection or the spread of bird flu.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Ranchers and producers can find more information &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/livestock/enhance-biosecurity"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first confirmed case of bird flu in cattle in Arizona was in mid-February in Maricopa County. Bird flu or avian flu is a generic name for &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22401-bird-flu"&gt;a variety of viruses&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, the strain H5N1 is responsible for outbreaks in poultry, wild birds, and now cattle.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Arizona Department of Health Services is collaborating with the Arizona Department of Agriculture “in the response to avian influenza and will continue to monitor influenza activity in Arizona in collaboration with local health departments. While the risk to the general public remains low, workers and individuals that may be at risk for exposure to avian influenza should follow public health guidance,” said Nicole Witt, the department of health services assistant director of preparedness in a Nov. 14 news release.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brownlee says there needs to be more and more clear guidance for Arizona’s cattle industry, not only to protect herds, but the ranchers who rely on them and the public that consumes dairy and beef, and to slow the interspecies spread of the virus.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone_load_1169407939"&gt;&lt;broadstreet-zone place="0" callback="zone_load_1169407939" zone-id="159788" keywords="not_home_page,not_landing_page,is_article_page,community,environment,cher-the-cow-and-other-herds-face-new-threat-as-bird-flu-reaches-arizona-cattle,post" soft-keywords="true" zone-alias=""&gt;&lt;/broadstreet-zone&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/mammals.html#:~:text=What%20to%20know,in%20more%20than%20200%20mammals"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt;, at least 70 people in the United States have been infected with the virus so far, and one person has died. There have been no recorded cases in humans in Arizona, according to the CDC.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the country, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html"&gt;millions of poultry&lt;/a&gt; have been affected, leading to the killing of almost 150 million chickens. That has led to spiking egg prices. Wild birds and house cats have also been infected. 

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cattle have been infected in 17 states, with almost 1,000 herds affected as of early March. In the last 30 days, as of March 6, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock"&gt;confirmed cases in four states&lt;/a&gt;, including Arizona.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brownlee said the first case in Arizona cattle was the same strain seen in Texas. It wasn’t a new strain, “which is good,” Brownlee said. “As the viruses change, that’s when we worry about them jumping species.”

Photo by Michael McKisson.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Brownlee repeatedly emphasizes that “our food is safe,” she says drinking raw milk poses a much greater risk. But being safe now doesn’t mean that things couldn’t quickly change for the worse.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://directorsblog.health.azdhs.gov/news-release-avian-influenza-update/"&gt;Dec. 6 press release&lt;/a&gt;, the state health department is:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working with local, state, and federal partners to monitor bird flu in farm animals and people who work closely with poultry and dairy cows.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Distributing protective gear to farm workers who have contact with infected animals.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Helping ensure individuals with symptoms of or exposure to bird flu have access to testing and treatment; providing prophylactic treatment to individuals who may have been exposed to bird flu. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Conducting timely public education efforts to ensure those impacted have information about avian influenza.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no emergency plan for this right now,” Brownlee says of the outbreak. She pointed specifically to the State Veterinarian’s Office of Arizona’s Department of Agriculture, saying they should be doing more to inform both the public and producers about the threats and precautions that could be taken.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arizona Luminaria reached out to the veterinarian’s office. They did not respond.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s like a fire off in the distance. Let’s see if it fizzles out, goes away,” she said. “But if we know anything about viruses, they don’t go away. They just change.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to statistics kept by the &lt;a href="https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/h702q636h/sf26b275x/h989sz55j/catl0125.pdf"&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt;, there are about a million cows in Arizona.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brownlee said that despite the cattle industry’s importance to the state, there hasn’t been a lot of guidance about how to respond to the threats of the bird flu. Nor has there been additional funding, she says, gently pushing away Cher’s big head again.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That paucity of guidance is why Brownlee is launching a survey for Arizona cattle ranchers. She said producers have struggled to get information that is reputable. “I’m researching this, trying to figure out how we can help producers with their biosecurity protocols,” Brownlee said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the survey’s introduction, “The ongoing situation, which has significantly impacted livestock trade across the United States, underscores the rapid adaptability of the virus and the necessity for prompt action to prevent further spread.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brownlee hopes ranchers recognize that same urgency and start taking precautions.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most critically, that would include greater biosecurity practices and more consistent testing, Brownlee says.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brownlee defined biosecurity as basically knowing who and what comes onto a farm. 

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of agricultural facilities have tried to open their doors up to expose people to agriculture,” Brownlee said, such as schoolchildren taking field trips to see milk cows. “That’s great education, but that also opens them up to a huge biosecurity risk,” Brownlee said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also said cattle are curious. If someone drops something over a fence, the cows will go and check it out.

Photo by Michael McKisson.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As if on cue, Peach — a smaller cow with a rufous-brown coat and a twisting cowlick on the top of her huge head — snapped her attention to Arizona Luminaria’s photographer, appearing ready to swallow his camera.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ag industry wants to be transparent about how the animals are being treated, but flu threats make us need to be more secure,” Brownlee said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;United Dairymen of Arizona have begun suggesting putting on biohazard suits when directly managing cattle, Brownlee said. Cooperatives like UDA have taken their own precautions, and Brownlee says they’ve been reimbursing the costs for individual producers testing for bird flu. Brownlee said that the state, too, has been reimbursing some test costs.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, she emphasized, with a changing, species-jumping virus on the horizon, both the state and individual producers need to do more to safeguard their herds.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Chloe Burgess, from Southampton, was already taking two common antidepressants in 2019 before she was prescribed ivabradine — sold under the brand name Procoralan — to treat an abnormal heart rate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

Researchers emphasize these memory-enhancing methods could significantly benefit public education and digital literacy programs, addressing misinformation challenges in health, politics, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; The effectiveness of misinformation resistance is directly tied to how well individuals recall initial training interventions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Booster Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Regular memory-focused reminders significantly extend the duration and strength of misinformation resistance, similar to medical vaccine boosters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Universal Approach:&lt;/strong&gt; Text, video, and gamified methods were all effective, highlighting the broad potential for scalable anti-misinformation programs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study has found that targeted psychological interventions can significantly enhance long-term resistance to misinformation. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dubbed “psychological booster shots,” these interventions improve memory retention and help individuals recognize and resist misleading information more effectively over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, explores how different approaches, including text-based messages, videos, and online games, can inoculate people against misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers from the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Bristol, Potsdam and King’s College London conducted five large-scale experiments with over 11,000 participants to examine the durability of these interventions and identify ways to strengthen their effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team tested three types of misinformation-prevention methods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Text-based interventions, where participants read pre-emptive messages explaining common misinformation tactics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Video-based interventions, short educational clips that expose the emotional manipulation techniques used in misleading content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gamified interventions, an interactive game that teaches people to spot misinformation tactics by having them create their own (fictional) fake news stories in a safe, controlled environment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were then exposed to misinformation and evaluated on their ability to detect and resist it over time. The study found that while all three interventions were effective, their effects diminished quickly over time, prompting questions about their long-term impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, providing memory-enhancing “booster” interventions, such as a follow-up reminder or reinforcement message, helped maintain misinformation resistance for a significantly longer period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that the longevity of misinformation resistance was primarily driven by how well participants remembered the original intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow-up reminders or memory-enhancing exercises were also found to significantly extend the effectiveness of the initial intervention, much like medical booster vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the researchers found that boosters that did not focus on memory, but rather focused on increasing participants’ motivation to defend themselves by reminding people of the looming threat of misinformation, did not have any measurable benefits for the longevity of the effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher Dr. Rakoen Maertens from the University of Oxford’s Department of Experimental Psychology, said: “Misinformation is a persistent global challenge, influencing everything from climate change debates to vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research shows that just as medical booster shots enhance immunity, psychological booster shots can strengthen people’s resistance to misinformation over time. By integrating memory-boosting techniques into public education and digital literacy programs, we can help people retain these critical skills for much longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Stephan Lewandowsky, Chair in Cognitive Psychology at the University of Bristol and a co-author of the study, emphasised the generality of the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said: “It is important that the effects of the inoculation interventions were nearly the same for videos, games, and text-based material. This makes it much easier to roll out inoculation at scale and in a broad range of contexts to boost people’s skills in recognizing when they are being misled.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study highlights the urgent need for scalable and more durable misinformation interventions and highlights the importance of collaboration between researchers, policymakers, and social media platforms to integrate these insights into public information campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f7949f859e848398879f9285d99a949e99838e8592b796939a9e99d9988fd99694d9829c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Christopher McIntyre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ox.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Christopher McIntyre – University of Oxford&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-57205-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Psychological Booster Shots Targeting Memory Increase Long-Term Resistance Against Misinformation&lt;/a&gt;” by Rakoen Maertens et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychological Booster Shots Targeting Memory Increase Long-Term Resistance Against Misinformation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An increasing number of real-world interventions aim to preemptively protect or inoculate people against misinformation. Inoculation research has demonstrated positive effects on misinformation resilience when measured immediately after treatment via messages, games, or videos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, very little is currently known about their long-term effectiveness and the mechanisms by which such treatment effects decay over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We start by proposing three possible models on the mechanisms driving resistance to misinformation. We then report five pre-registered longitudinal experiments (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt; = 11,759) that investigate the effectiveness of psychological inoculation interventions over time as well as their underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We find that text-based and video-based inoculation interventions can remain effective for one month—whereas game-based interventions appear to decay more rapidly—and that memory-enhancing booster interventions can enhance the diminishing effects of counter-misinformation interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we propose an integrated memory-motivation model, concluding that misinformation researchers would benefit from integrating knowledge from the cognitive science of memory to design better psychological interventions that can counter misinformation durably over time and at-scale.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 13:00:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPWlowcVcwLWVwNUh0Y1hidF9ici0xVWk4TUpScU45M2lGcVpPZ1dLWVhod3RqZGpRNmRUTEFiQU02aHJOUXJpd1hTUkhYRXJ3SDc1X09iYzhNVVQtbkxyQ1N5Z05zNEtyOEk1Zklla25RZlE1OTViZHR5a2RUai1iUkZn</guid></item><item><title>Rewriting Neuroscience: Possible “Foundations of Human Intelligence” Observed for the First Time - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxNcThOUHgzWG1hS1Qtc0d4UHhaNENEV3htTWZsbDE0ZThSNmZsa0YxSzAzRW43MmdsV1lxeDU1a2lJV3dZRU9lYVVhMDZZQnFBYmM4SHJ3Wkg4cjBpNzlFLVAtN09oS3ozVkk5V3RoQnc5YXBZLThxd0M2QldkRWF3ZEYxWEVZRzFQT0ZtWDhTNWhuRnhFUWM0SjM5SmkwVUFBTEFudnJia1F4Wkg1Y3JIM3FyY1VDN1lEd3p3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:51:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxNcThOUHgzWG1hS1Qtc0d4UHhaNENEV3htTWZsbDE0ZThSNmZsa0YxSzAzRW43MmdsV1lxeDU1a2lJV3dZRU9lYVVhMDZZQnFBYmM4SHJ3Wkg4cjBpNzlFLVAtN09oS3ozVkk5V3RoQnc5YXBZLThxd0M2QldkRWF3ZEYxWEVZRzFQT0ZtWDhTNWhuRnhFUWM0SjM5SmkwVUFBTEFudnJia1F4Wkg1Y3JIM3FyY1VDN1lEd3p3</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr. Makes More Alarming Comments About Measles Amid U.S. Outbreaks - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxONWtDSm9XdnBYd0hJVjVGMDZEMjZvRDNKRDQxOThpd2lOV3lia1pLOEZLUlVBQzBVaWZOLTZzWmhBUDI2X0l1aDVhQWw0WURLYzE5Y3hwYWNzTW9QcUFTQWtMcUVSLXFJVHdVYUpRX21pLVk2MXBHNThRQU5CR2pnd2xOaWXSAYoBQVVfeXFMTld6dnVsaFlpWVVCcjQ4Vk01VlNMeDY0R0JBdzNxeUxvbXZocFp5T1BtWEZ4OElUaE1vbWptc2JyRlRER3p6Mkx2Wm1MR25oMVRTU3hUTV80T0dZRW95U1EtMlN4U3hFS2piUmV1WFlZUkFfcXRXeG52aUpVZ1J5R0o1WGVoM1FNMDN3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

And the drinks aren't likely to be a cause of concern when consumed in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Crushell said the children were so sick they were referred for genetic testing because the pediatricians in the emergency departments suspected a metabolic disorder. Most of them came into the emergency room unconscious, she said. One child had a seizure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Glycerol is a sugar alcohol naturally found in fats and oils that is used as a sugar replacement. Besides slushie drinks, it is sometimes added to various other foods such as protein bars and shakes, dried fruit, chewing gum, and sugar-free candies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;When consumed, it is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and spread throughout the body's water stores. In large amounts, it can lead to excessive water retention and cause digestive issues such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The study suggests that young children may be more vulnerable to glycerol's effects because their smaller body size and developing metabolism make it harder for them to process and clear the compound efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Slush ice drinks have contained a lot of glycerol instead of sugar in recent years due to the increased demand for sugar-free food," Crushell explained. "To maintain the slush, you need either sugar or glycerol, but due to public health concerns and a sugar tax, sugar was reduced and glycerol was added."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Parents should watch for any signs of drowsiness or reduced consciousness, slurring of speech, nausea, or general sickness after a child has downed a slushie drink, Crushell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"If parents suspect that their child is becoming unwell, the first thing they should do is to stop them from drinking any more of the drink," she advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Crushell also recommended giving the child something sugary to eat and seeking medical attention if they have a reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Although this study only looked at children in the UK and Ireland, slushie drinks are also popular in the U.S., with sales of frozen drinks, including slushies, topping over $6B in 2024, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cognitivemarketresearch.com/regional-analysis/north-america-frozen-drinks-market-report" target="_blank"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the website Cognitive Market Research. The Food Standards Scotland and Food Standards Agency already recommends that the drinks should not be sold to children four years of age or younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Crushell emphasized that there are many reasons to limit how many slushie ice drinks children consume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The main takeaway is that slush ice drinks do not convey any health benefits to children, whether they're full of sugar or glycerol," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Heya Batah, MD is an internal medicine resident at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:21:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNVWo3Wl9QNTAwUndIZUE3TDBDUEh4OWp2ZFprcENFZE12Y2Rrc2JPQWJUaU1haGpya1F2cGZ1TzlQOTgzNkRFQnhBRVlFU1FzOEVkOTNNMWN0SFVlYXREU3VDaVNodndlWXRaaC11U3NQM2tsTHF5LTZZODBVUWZmZjh3ZGVkckxNQzNrSXRrcmdJeWJGTEZvSWZZT3BoeTg00gGmAUFVX3lxTE5TZ2NWeVp2d05NMnhKVzFReDRNeFJMVk9KN18tbjh1ckl6MDZJbVQzSUJEbjZqS2lkeHptMTBlQWtmWlRudUhnZjRYTHlTTGFvMVN5clNSQ1BPamFSUjR4RFh6UU0xZzBHU2p0ZTE3VnFUSVp0cUNEWU52dkJyTHFGX3BnZTlUMWdlM0R1NDZuRmJielp3S2hpVXlTVEdxdnNQdlNuRkE</guid></item><item><title>An urgent argument for the HPV vaccine - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxPLS1XTDJ5ZTVlLUpiT1BOQTRXS3NYcTdsNUw2WmhxWWMtSW95MVp0Z2VtYnlrTkNwS2NzVlR5VE5abENCNHhqcjQwNkctOGJJbXlOQnZxT2ZHNlNWcjNmUnVONWExc3EyM3pyZnVKWWllcUZ0OHRIdF9fTTNXdzVnRXo1ZFFWTWRBN2VSNlpSVVk3dGZtSGs5bUhB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Chris Riley's symptoms started in the summer of 2021. At first, he didn't think much about them. His throat felt a little sore, and he noticed hardening of his lymph nodes. At 57 years old, Riley was active and healthy. He biked everywhere and didn't even own a car.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Riley, it turned out, had oropharyngeal cancer, which develops in the tonsils or throat. In Riley's case, it had originated in his left tonsil, but by the time it was discovered — after visits to a dentist, a general practitioner, and an ear, nose and throat specialist — it had spread to his lymph nodes. &lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The cause, according to his doctors, was human papillomavirus, or HPV.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;blockquote class="edTag"&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;HPV is a virus that can live and replicate in certain cells on the surface of the skin and mucous membranes, including the inner lining of the mouth, throat and genitals. While &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/hpv/types-of-hpv.html#:~:text=There%20are%20more%20than%20200,mucosal%20membranes%20or%20mucosal%20surfaces)." target="_blank"&gt;over 200 types of the virus exist&lt;/a&gt;, only a few can lead to cancer, usually many years or decades after exposure. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nearly everyone who isn't vaccinated against HPV will be infected at some point, though &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;9 out of 10 infections resolve&lt;/a&gt; within two years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Passed from person to person through skin-to-skin contact, usually during sexual activity, HPV is best known for causing cervical cancer, which kills about 4,000 people in the United States every year. But the virus can also lead to warts and other malignancies, including cancer of the throat, anus and genitalia — it's linked to six types of cancers in total. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, HPV is responsible for approximately &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/cases.html" target="_blank"&gt;37,800 cases of cancer&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. each year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-53252" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A safe and well-tolerated vaccine can &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/vaccines/reasons-to-get.html" target="_blank"&gt;prevent about 90%&lt;/a&gt; of such cancers. But in the U.S., HPV vaccines continue to be among the most underutilized recommended vaccines, a tragedy that may worsen if Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Trump's new secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, tries to discredit them and limit access.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy is an anti-vaccine activist who has spread false claims about the HPV vaccine, including the assertion that it can cause cancer, and has &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-cabinet-kennedy-health-secretary-ethics-390e47ac1dd11aeef954851a9a5358ac" target="_blank"&gt;benefited financially&lt;/a&gt; by referring clients to support legal challenges against manufacturer Merck. His role gives Kennedy a powerful platform from which to further undermine vaccine acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-delivers-floor-speech-in-support-of-rfk-jr-to-be-hhs-secretary/" target="_blank"&gt;pledged to Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy&lt;/a&gt; of Louisiana, a physician, that he would maintain the CDC's current vaccine safety and monitoring systems&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and back recommended vaccination schedules. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But he also refused to accept decades of medical research validating the safety of vaccines. When &lt;a href="https://www.murray.senate.gov/in-senate-hearing-rfk-jr-refuses-to-say-hpv-vaccine-is-safe-to-sen-patty-murray-pressed-on-credible-accusation-of-sexual-assault/" target="_blank"&gt;questioned by Democratic Sen. Patty Murray&lt;/a&gt; of Washington, he declined to say whether he stands by his prior statements calling the HPV vaccine "dangerous and defective."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;An underutilized prevention tool&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To be highly effective, HPV vaccines must be given at a young age, before the onset of sexual activity. An &lt;a href="https://publichealthscotland.scot/news/2024/january/no-cervical-cancer-cases-detected-in-vaccinated-women-following-hpv-immunisation/" target="_blank"&gt;analysis from Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, where school-based programs promote universal HPV vaccination, showed no cases of cervical cancer in fully immunized women who received their first HPV shot at ages 12 or 13. In the U.S., the HPV vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a4.htm?s_cid=mm7406a4_w" target="_blank"&gt;has been credited&lt;/a&gt; with a 79% reduction in the incidence of cervical precancer in women ages 20-24.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Introduced in 2006, the HPV vaccine initially was approved only for girls and young women. Its &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hpv/hcp/recommendations.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommended use&lt;/a&gt; now includes everyone through age 26, though vaccination at ages 11 to 12 — &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9980633/" target="_blank"&gt;or even earlier&lt;/a&gt; — is preferred. When the vaccine is initiated at ages 9 to 14, usually two doses are required. When the first dose is given at or after age 15, three doses are recommended.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7333a1.htm?s_cid=mm7333a1_w#T2_down" target="_blank"&gt;Recent data&lt;/a&gt; indicates that only about 61% of adolescents ages 13 to 17 have completed the HPV vaccination series. Rates have stagnated in the last few years and lag far behind usage of other common adolescent immunizations to prevent meningococcal disease (88.4%) and tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (89%).&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"The HPV vaccine is crucial," said Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.venturafamilymed.org/faculty" target="_blank"&gt;Carlos O'Bryan-Becerra&lt;/a&gt;, a family physician with Ventura County Medical Center in California and a 2022-23 vaccine science fellow with the American Academy of Family Physicians. He cited its ability to prevent oropharyngeal cancer and five other types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately, many patients, their families, and even clinicians are unaware that HPV causes cancers beyond the cervix," O'Bryan-Becerra said. "This lack of awareness makes it even more important to promote the vaccine as a cancer prevention tool."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rates of HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer, most often seen in men, have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132363/" target="_blank"&gt;surpassed&lt;/a&gt; rates of cervical cancer. Overall, men are 2.7 times more likely to be diagnosed with an HPV-associated malignancy and face mortality rates that are 2.8 times that of affected women.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-53255" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Treatment for oropharyngeal cancer can be brutal. Riley, a former Austin City Council member, started radiation and chemotherapy soon after his diagnosis. But it came with a tremendous cost. His salivary glands and taste buds were destroyed, and for months, he required a feeding tube to ensure adequate nutrition. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Despite frequent chocolate milkshakes, one of few foods he could still taste, he lost weight and became exhausted with even minimal activity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I see people just eating normal diets and going to normal restaurants, and that will never be me again," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Barriers to vaccination&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pervasive misinformation surrounding HPV and the safety and necessity of its vaccine remains an enormous hurdle for vaccine promotion. Some families assume, incorrectly, that the vaccine is only for girls or is indicated only after a young person becomes sexually active. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mistrust around immunizations increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and remains widespread. Some argue that the HPV vaccine encourages promiscuity, an allegation that has been &lt;a href="https://ihpi.umich.edu/news/promoting-hpv-vaccine-doesn%E2%80%99t-lead-more-teen-sex-study-shows" target="_blank"&gt;thoroughly debunked&lt;/a&gt;. Still others aren't convinced that HPV is a serious health threat.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vaccine hesitancy can occur even among medical and nursing staff, which undermines promotion efforts, says O'Bryan-Becerra.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Cultural stigma associated with sexually transmitted infections contributes to such hesitancy. Many teenagers and their families feel embarrassed discussing the topic, which can deter them from seeking the vaccine. People of color, those who live in rural areas and those without private health insurance are less likely than others to be vaccinated against HPV.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The HPV vaccine represents a powerful tool in the fight against cancer. Yet, accurate information and access are often lacking in schools and even health clinics. Doctors and their teams need to provide clear guidance about the importance of early HPV vaccination, before a young person becomes sexually active, to provide the best protection.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Without widespread proactive measures to educate and improve vaccination rates, we risk perpetuating falsehoods and health disparities.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Riley died last summer, after a final effort to treat his cancer with chemotherapy and immunotherapy failed. The cancer had returned about a year after his initial treatment and had spread to his liver. He had just turned 60. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the weeks before he died, he mused about HPV vaccines, which probably would have saved his life, had they been available to him as a child. He was perplexed by HPV vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It just seems really strange to me that a parent would have an opportunity to protect their kid against something like what I've been through and yet would forgo that opportunity," Riley told me in our final conversation. If more parents understood the vaccine's lifesaving potential, he said, "people would be clamoring" for it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was produced by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://publichealthwatch.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Public Health Watch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a nonprofit news organization. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lisadoggett.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lisa Doggett &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;is a family and lifestyle medicine physician at the Multiple Sclerosis and Neuroimmunology Center of UT Health Austin, the clinical practice of Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin.

            A newborn with measles is among the cases reported in the growing West Texas outbreak, Lubbock public health officials say. Experts say the case serves as a reminder that the disease can be especially dangerous for pregnant women and very young children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xos1cx00023b5voybz8et9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is how widespread this epidemic is, that it’s even showing up in unvaccinated pregnant women,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xtbi6200083b6mma2pwf2h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At least two pregnant women have been infected in this outbreak, according to officials at Covenant Hospital in Lubbock. Eighty-one measles cases have been reported in children ages 4 and younger across Texas and New Mexico. This is part of the larger outbreak that now spans three states, including Oklahoma, and totals 258 reported cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xos1cy00033b5vq8qrja0o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The infant, who has recovered, was born to an unvaccinated mother who was recently infected with the virus, according to Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock Public Health.

            Measles is a highly contagious airborne illness that can cause a rash,  fever, red eyes and cough. Severe cases can result in blindness, pneumonia or encephalitis, swelling of the brain. In some cases, the illness can be fatal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xos1cy00043b5vwiv4ekgj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Both newborns and pregnant women are at higher risk of complications from the measles virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Unvaccinated mothers who get measles earlier in pregnancy risk low birth weight, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;premature birth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK582537/#:~:text=Having%20measles%2C%20mumps%2C%20or%20rubella%20during%20pregnancy%20might%20increase%20the,is%20expected%20to%20be%20rare." target="_blank"&gt;still birth&lt;/a&gt;.

            For those who get the infection later in pregnancy, there is a higher chance of passing the infection to the baby through vertical transmission – in which the virus passes through the placenta – or, more commonly, through airborne transmission right after birth.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xorjnn00003b5vmyp14und@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When their mothers have immunity against measles, babies younger than 6 months will have some immunity via her antibodies. But if a mother is unvaccinated or doesn’t have immunity, babies are left susceptible.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xos1cy00093b5vb4oh5z7g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Neonates have a more fragile immune system, and their recovery could be more complicated,” says Dr. Lynn Yee, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xos1cy000b3b5vgb3jl66y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pregnant women who are unvaccinated are themselves at higher risk of measles complications, such as pneumonia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xos1cy000c3b5vhfj7guhr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People who aren’t pregnant can receive the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine up to 72 hours after being exposed to the virus, to prevent infection. But pregnant women cannot get the vaccine; instead, they can receive immunoglobulin, or antibodies, up to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html#:~:text=People%20exposed%20to%20measles%20who,the%20clinical%20course%20of%20disease." target="_blank"&gt;six days&lt;/a&gt; after a measles exposure. Infants younger than 6 months can receive immunoglobulin after exposure, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xos1cy000d3b5vp685paes@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yee has never treated a patient with measles, but she has counseled pregnant women who were exposed to the virus but who hadn’t been vaccinated as children because of their parents’ wishes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xos1cy000e3b5v800r2qi7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think most patients want to protect themselves, and perhaps there is some feeling of maybe regret or anger that they weren’t better protected,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xos1cy000f3b5vgemlek79@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although measles poses severe health risks, doctors are generally more concerned with how the viral infection rubella can affect newborns.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xos1cy000g3b5vzrcll7nc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Women who are not vaccinated against measles are also not vaccinated against rubella,” noted Dr. William Moss, a pediatrician who directs of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “Thus, these women are also at risk of having a baby with congenital rubella syndrome should they acquire rubella in the first trimester of pregnancy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xos1cy000h3b5vpghfohxm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among women who are infected with rubella early in pregnancy, there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-rubella-vaccination/data-research/facts-stats/index.html#:~:text=Rubella%20can%20cause%20severe%20birth%20defects%20and%20death&amp;amp;text=When%20a%20pregnant%20woman%20is,heart%20defects%2C%20or%20developmental%20delays" target="_blank"&gt;90%&lt;/a&gt; chance the baby will have &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/health/rubella-house-zika-babies-future/index.html"&gt;congenital rubella syndrome.&lt;/a&gt; This can cause developmental delays, heart defects, deafness and cataracts. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-rubella-vaccination/data-research/facts-stats/index.html#:~:text=Rubella%20can%20cause%20severe%20birth%20defects%20and%20death&amp;amp;text=When%20a%20pregnant%20woman%20is,heart%20defects%2C%20or%20developmental%20delays" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, 1 in 3 babies with congenital rubella syndrome will die before their first birthday. There is less risk when the infection occurs after &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2532864/#:~:text=If%20the%20fetus%20gets%20rubella,This%20vaccine%20is%20very%20safe." target="_blank"&gt;20 weeks&lt;/a&gt; of pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Rubella was once common and widespread in the United States, but was eliminated in the US in 2004. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rubella/vaccine-impact/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; says fewer than 10 people in the US are reported to have rubella each year and they’re mostly linked to travel outside the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The MMR vaccine is highly safe and effective, according to experts. One dose confers &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;93%&lt;/a&gt; immunity against measles and 97% against rubella. With the second dose, measles immunity rises to 97%, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The most important thing you can do is … to get vaccinated,” Yee said. “Vaccines work. …This is preventable. This should not be happening.”

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Residents of west Texas “come here to shop at the big box stores – Walmart, Costco, Sam’s and so forth,” said Cook, adding that Lubbock hospitals have already treated 38 measles patients from the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The deaths are the first from measles in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/10/vaccines-measles-outbreak-immune-system" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;nearly a decade&lt;/a&gt; – and come as a test for the Trump

vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Cook described an outbreak curve, familiar to those who watched infections rise and fall during the Covid-19 pandemic, that is still on the “incline”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;His concerns are shared by other local physicians, such as Dr Philip Huang, director of the Dallas county’s department of health and human services, who told local &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/texas-measles-outbreak-update-200-cases-spring-break/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; news affiliate: “There’s concern that some of the people in west Texas are going to spread across the country. It’s not slowing down. This is not over, and there will be more cases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a1d02393-11f3-4050-8647-bd33177030f1" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;People attend a prayer service at the Covenant medical center in Lubbock, Texas, on 26 February 2025, after the first measles death was reported.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Mary Conlon/AP&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Cook said people also travel for maternity and pediatric care. He worries that the immunocompromised and babies could be exposed to measles in doctor’s waiting rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I personally don’t think I anticipated this, although I’m not surprised,” said Dr Tammy Camp, pediatric residency coordinator with Texas Tech University &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Sciences Center, also in Lubbock. When fewer people vaccinate, she said, “you always know you’re ripe for the possibility of an outbreak”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to medicine. Doctors often use the example of a room full of people to illustrate this: if 10 unvaccinated individuals enter and one has measles, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#:~:text=But%20measles%20can%20cause%20serious,if%20they%20are%20not%20protected." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;nine leave infected&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00522.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC expects&lt;/a&gt; the outbreak to continue spreading and potentially worsen with the upcoming spring and summer travel season. Although measles was once a common childhood disease, it is not without risks and general misery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The most common symptoms include a characteristic top-down rash, fever, runny nose and red, watery eyes. Severe symptoms are less common but can be devastating: about one in a thousand infected children suffer severe brain swelling, called encephalitis, a condition that can lead to seizures, deafness and intellectual disability. Between one and three out of a thousand will die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Additionally, scientists believe that measles infection can make people more vulnerable to secondary infections for months because it suppresses the immune system. Very rare conditions can also strike: about one in 25,000 children, or the equivalent of about &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20561004/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;four each year&lt;/a&gt;, suffer a degenerative neurological condition called &lt;a href="https://www.encephalitis.info/types-of-encephalitis/infectious-encephalitis/measles-infection-and-encephalitis/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;subacute sclerosing panencephalitis&lt;/a&gt;. The disease presents years after infection with dementia-like symptoms that are eventually fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The measles vaccine is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html#:~:text=Two%20doses%20of%20MMR%20vaccine%20are%2097%25%20effective%20against%20measles,are%20eliminated%20from%20the%20body." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;97% effective&lt;/a&gt; at preventing the disease. The vaccine’s side effects, while uncomfortable, are typically transient, and include fever and rash. Rarer side effects, such as febrile seizure, are nearly 10 times less common than children dying from measles infection, according to studies cited by the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html#:~:text=Two%20studies%20indicate%20that%20for,These%20symptoms%20rarely%20come%20back." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-16" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-rsfwa"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;This Week in Trumpland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"the-stakes-us-election-edition","successDescription":"A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

&lt;p&gt;“One is the RIO study,” he said. “This studied up to 70 people using a bnAb [broadly neutralising antibody] strategy. We don't know how many people achieved viral control in that study, but I think we're going to find out in a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The other is the FRESH/Gilead study, which is done in South African women living with HIV, most of whom have subtype C virus. This is a really different population and it’s critically important for the global cure agenda.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;RIO&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results from RIO were presented two days later. This study, conducted in the UK and Denmark, gave half of its 68 participants placebo saline infusions. The other half got infusions of long-lasting formulations of two antibodies that can neutralise HIV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="embed-glossary-wrap"&gt;

&lt;div class="embed-glossary-item"&gt;

&lt;div class="definition"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A neutralising antibody (NAb) is an antibody that fully defends its target cell from an antigen. A broadly neutralising antibody (bNAb) is a neutralising antibody that has this effect against a wide range of antigens. A number of broadly neutralising antibodies have been isolated from persons living with HIV. Some of them are being studied and, in some cases, used in clinical trials, to defend humans against HIV infection, treat HIV infection, and kill HIV-infected CD4+ T cells in latent reservoirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="embed-glossary-item"&gt;

&lt;div class="definition"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To eliminate a disease or a condition in an individual, or to fully restore health. A cure for HIV infection is one of the ultimate long-term goals of research today. It refers to a strategy or strategies that would eliminate HIV from a person’s body, or permanently control the virus and render it unable to cause disease. A ‘sterilising’ cure would completely eliminate the virus. A ‘functional’ cure would suppress HIV viral load, keeping it below the level of detection without the use of ART. The virus would not be eliminated from the body but would be effectively controlled and prevented from causing any illness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="embed-glossary-item"&gt;

&lt;div class="definition"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of a research study, when study participants are requested to interrupt their antiretroviral therapy (ART) and be closely monitored. Most of these studies are in the field that aims to eventually achieve ‘ART-free remission’ or ‘HIV cure’. They usually look at the time it takes for the viral load to rebound after the interruption, following which ART is restarted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="embed-glossary-item"&gt;

&lt;div class="definition"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Halting of the function or replication of a virus. In HIV, optimal viral suppression is measured as the reduction of viral load (HIV RNA) to undetectable levels and is the goal of antiretroviral therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="embed-glossary-item"&gt;

&lt;div class="definition"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a person on antiretroviral therapy (ART) has persistent, detectable levels of HIV in the blood after a period of undetectable levels. Causes of viral rebound can include drug resistance, poor adherence to an HIV treatment regimen or interrupting treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One is 3BNC117, which sticks to the part of HIV’s envelope ‘spikes’ that lock on to the CD4 receptor on T-cells. The other is 10-1074, which blocks a different part of the envelope, the V3 loop. Immediately after their infusions, all participants were taken off their antiretroviral therapy (ART) in an analytical treatment interruption (ATI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty weeks after starting the ATI, all but three of the 31 placebo recipients had been put back on ART because their HIV had reappeared. RIO’s definition of viral ‘rebound’ was either a viral load of over 1000 for at least six weeks, or two consecutive viral loads of more than 100,000 at least a week apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, two of the remaining three placebo recipients have still not rebounded 120 weeks after starting their ATI, so are regarded as post-treatment controllers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the bnAb recipients, however, only 12 of the 34 had had a viral load ‘rebound’ by week 20. To put it the other way, 65% of the initial participants had maintained viral loads below 1000, or 75% of those still in the study (some dropped out). This may be the highest proportion of participants with delayed viral rebound yet seen in a bnAb study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The percentage of participants rebounding at week 20 was the study’s primary endpoint, but at this point bnAb recipients who were still virally suppressed were given another shot of the two antibodies and continued without ART.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the 48th week after stopping ART, 57% had still not rebounded, and by week 72 – over 14 months after stopping ART – 39% had still not. Seven participants (24%) had not had a single viral load reading over 50 by this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chief investigator &lt;a href="https://www.aidsmap.com/news/jul-2018/kick-didnt-kill-first-ever-randomised-hiv-cure-study-fails-eliminate-infected-cells"&gt;Professor Sarah Fidler of Imperial College&lt;/a&gt; London told the conference that 23.5% of bnAb recipients (eight people) had the typical viral rebound pattern of a rapidly increasing viral load within the first 20 weeks. Four of these ‘rapid rebounders’ had mutations in their HIV suggesting it would be resistant to 10-1074 (currently there is no assay for resistance to 3BNC117).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forty-eight per cent of bnAb recipients had a delayed reappearance of their HIV, between 20 and 72 weeks after stopping ART. Not all of these were single rebound events – many participants had viral loads that oscillated between undetectability and quite high values, up to 55,000, before restarting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This left seven people with complete viral suppression – which, so far, has lasted 120 weeks or nearly two years after stopping ART.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, viral suppression cannot be explained solely by the levels of antibodies circulating in the participants. The two antibodies have half-lives of nine to ten weeks, so would have sub-therapeutic values by week 48.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Substudies found that the amount of intact proviral DNA in participants’ reservoir cells declined in all but one of the 22 participants in which it was measured, with a third of them having declines of over six logs (a millionfold decrease). At the same time, the amount of defective DNA incapable of producing live viruses increased slightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a study that used three different assays to measure T-cell responses to HIV in the participants who did not experience viral rebound found that the strength of these responses increased between week zero and week 36 after stopping ART. This is despite the fact that, because they remained virally suppressed, there were not enough HIV viral antigens circulating to stimulate such responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This indicates that the bnAbs, as had been hoped, did more than simply neutralise viral particles – they had a ‘vaccinal’ effect of strengthening immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In RIO, the participants were all cisgender men, with an average age of just under 40 and an average CD4 count at enrolment of 800 (the minimum CD4 count allowed was 500). They had all started ART, mainly integrase-inhibitor-based, soon after infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;FRESH&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from also having HIV, the participants in the second study, from &lt;a href="https://www.aidsmap.com/news/jul-2016/young-women-treated-very-early-hiv-infection-stay-hiv-negative-and-preserve-immune"&gt;the FRESH cohort&lt;/a&gt; in South Africa, could not have been more different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FRESH (Females Rising through Education, Support and Health), established over a decade ago,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;combines epidemiology, cure research and community empowerment in young women in KwaZulu-Natal, the area with the world’s highest general-population HIV incidence. FRESH involves a cohort of initially HIV-negative young women who it tests for HIV very intensively, with RNA tests twice a week. This enables those who test positive to start ART at the earliest possible stage – at so-called Fiebig stage 1, within a couple of weeks of infection, when people first test positive for HIV RNA but have not yet become HIV antibody positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study presented at CROI shows that it is possible to conduct sophisticated cure research in a lower-income African setting. As well as extending cure research to a disadvantaged minority, it also investigates whether the kind of cure intervention that worked in RIO’s predominantly male, middle-aged and gay participants – who mainly had HIV subtype B – also works in a young female population with subtype C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FRESH study used different antibodies to RIO: long-lasting versions of VRC07-523, another CD4 binding site bnAb, and CAP256V2, which blocks the V1-V2 section of HIV’s envelope protein. It was designed as an open-label study without a placebo, and primarily as a safety study, as this particular pair of bnAbs has not been tested in people with HIV before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were 20 participants, all but three of whom had their HIV diagnosed at Fiebig stage 1 and who started ART within three days of diagnosis. They remained on ART for an average of seven years (minimum 1.7 years). Because they had started ART so early, the majority had had a peak viral load no higher than 5000 and none of them has ever had a CD4 count below 500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participants were tested for susceptibility to both bnAbs. Eleven were sensitive to both, seven to VRC07 alone, and two to CAP256 alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were given an infusion of each antibody at the end of the first week of the study. In addition to the bnAbs, they also took &lt;a href="https://www.aidsmap.com/news/mar-2020/hiv-cure-croi-new-data-antibodies-vaccines-and-genetically-engineered-t-cells"&gt;an oral immune-enhancing drug called vesatolimod&lt;/a&gt;, starting a week before the antibody infusion and then every two weeks for 18 weeks. Five weeks after the bnAb infusion, they stopped their ART.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary safety and viral suppression data was collected at week 20, two weeks after their last vesatolimod pill and 14 weeks into the ATI. Still, the ATI was continued (in those who did not need to resume ART) until its 42nd week, and then optionally extended in those still without viral rebound to its 54th week, over a year after stopping ART.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The criteria for restarting ART were similar to RIO’s – a viral load over 1000 for eight consecutive weeks, or a viral load of over 100,000 in two tests a week apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of safety, one person did have a severe immune reaction to the bnAbs – a so-called cytokine release – that meant she had to discontinue the study. Most other adverse events were injection site reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten participants needed to restart ART owing to the reappearance of their HIV before week 48 of the study. Another six had a delayed viral load rebound and although some did have moderate viral loads, they were able to delay restarting ART until week 48, the end of the per-protocol ATI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four participants, however, continued their ATI past that timepoint and have maintained either undetectable viral loads (in two cases) or viral loads that have never risen above 2000 in the other two, now for a median of 1.5 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Principal investigator Professor Thumbi Ndung’u told the conference that while 12 participants had typical viral rebounds where their viral load rose steadily, eight had an oscillating viral rebound where their HIV appeared and then disappeared repeatedly, a pattern also seen in RIO. This suggests a highly dynamic competition between the participants’ HIV and the vaccine-like effect of the bnAbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the FRESH study, concentrations of the two antibodies had declined to their IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, the level where they only neutralised half the virus, by 22 weeks after being given VRC07 and 31 weeks after CAP256, so viral suppression after this was probably due to the vaccine-like effect of the bnAbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the cure workshop, Michael Peluso commented that these two studies exemplified the most promising current area of cure research – of “antibodies that can be manufactured to target the most important areas of the virus, to either neutralise that virus itself or to improve immune responses against the virus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

After the right-wing vaccine critic Paul Thacker posted a tweet stating that the authors had posited that “millions of long COVID patients &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/DiedSuddenly_/status/1892382501261172922" target="_blank"&gt;may actually be vaccine injured&lt;/a&gt;,” Iwasaki tweeted a crisp reply: “No. This is &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/VirusesImmunity/status/1892749074840850757" target="_blank"&gt;not what our study shows&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no question that vaccine science has become poisoned with &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2024-06-11/how-a-blunder-by-a-respected-medical-journal-is-fueling-an-anti-vaccine-lie"&gt;disinformation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2024-07-30/column-opposing-vaccine-mandates-trump-exposes-kids-to-disease"&gt;right-wing ideology&lt;/a&gt;. The anti-science threat only intensified when Donald Trump appointed anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of Health and Human Services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2025/03/if-you-get-sick-its-your-fault-unless-you-got-vaccinated-in-which-case-its-the-vaccines-fault" target="_blank"&gt;a recent interview on Fox News&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy responded to a burgeoning measles outbreak in West Texas — which already has brought about the first measles death of a child in the U.S. in 10 years — by promoting ineffective nostrums such as cod liver oil and steroids. He questioned the safety of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which has been in use for more than a half-century and is known to confer &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nfid.org/resource/frequently-asked-questions-about-measles/" target="_blank"&gt;lifetime immunity to measles&lt;/a&gt; after two doses for the vast majority of people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Institutes of Health, which falls under the jurisdiction of HHS, has terminated grants for research into vaccine hesitancy, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/10/vaccines-nih-rfk-research-canceled/" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;, even though the Texas measles outbreak has been attributed to low measles vaccination rates in the religious community where the outbreak began. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And at a Senate confirmation hearing March 5, Jay Battacharya, a Stanford professor who is Trump’s nominee to head the NIH, said he endorsed further research on the purported link between the MMR vaccine and autism, even though the link was first posited by a British study that has long been retracted and no evidence of any such link has been found despite &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccines-and-other-conditions/autism" target="_blank"&gt;decades of intensive study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anti-vaccine movement’s targeting of COVID vaccination has long been underway, even thought the vaccines were estimated by the Commonwealth Fund to have &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/two-years-covid-vaccines-prevented-millions-deaths-hospitalizations" target="_blank"&gt;averted 18 million hospitalizations and 3 million deaths&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. in just their first two years of availability, during which 655 million doses were administered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The politicization of anti-COVID policies has led to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/06/states-push-fight-against-mrna-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;laws prohibiting mass vaccinations and vaccine promotion&lt;/a&gt; in Louisiana and Texas, and a proposal mounted by Gov. Ron DeSantis in Florida. In eight states — Florida, Tennessee, South Carolina, Texas, Iowa, Montana, Idaho and Washington —legislative efforts are underway to ban the mRNA COVID vaccines developed by Moderna and Pfizer, the leading vaccines in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yale study’s authors defend their decision to post the preprint online even as a preliminary study of post-vaccine medical conditions. “We were aware from the outset that this is a highly politicized research topic,” co-author Harlan Krumholz, a professor of medicine at Yale, told me by email. “The reality is that vaccine safety — like all areas of medicine — benefits from rigorous, open research, and suppressing inquiry would be counterproductive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krumholz added, “We were fully aware that our research could be misrepresented. That is precisely why we preprinted it — so that the full study could be read and scrutinized in context, rather than discussed based on speculation.... Suppressing studies because of concerns about how they might be misused sets a dangerous precedent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That brings us back to the study itself, which aimed to explore what the authors termed “post-vaccination syndrome.” Their goal was to pinpoint what biological conditions might predispose some people to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s true that some people have experienced adverse reactions to the COVID vaccines — as also happens with other shots. “Vaccines are medicines, and all medicines have side effects — even when the net benefit is large,” observes Adam Gaffney, a Harvard medical school assistant professor who has been critical of the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two people listed as co-authors on the Yale paper say they have experienced long-term aftereffects from COVID vaccinations. (Neither was among the subjects of the Yale study.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within an hour of receiving a COVID vaccine as a subject of an early clinical trial of a vaccine developed by AstraZeneca in 2020, Brianne Dressen says she began to experience symptoms such as brain fog, neuropathy (the feeling of pain or a pins-and-needles sensation in the limbs) and food sensitivities. “I feel like I’m rolling around in cactus all the time,” she told me. The AstraZeneca vaccine has been taken off the market due to competition from vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, which are more effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another listed co-author, retired Southern California gastroenterologist Danice  Hertz, told me she began feeling similar reactions after receiving the Pfizer vaccine after it was rolled out to the public in 2021. “I walked into the facility healthy and feeling fine, and within 24 hours I became severely ill. I had severe burning in my face, tremors, twitching; I felt like I was being electrocuted.” Both say these symptoms have improved, but some haven’t fully disappeared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both say they had trouble persuading their doctors to examine the connection between their symptoms and the shots. “It was very hard to get medical care,” Hertz says. “Nobody knew anything about these reactions. You really couldn’t get medical care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difficulty of finding medical treatment prompted Dressen to co-found REACT19, a tax-exempt organization that provides grants to patients and providers; Hertz is listed on its website as a research advisor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although critics have labeled REACT19 as an anti-vaccine organization, both say that’s untrue — it aims to support research into PVS. Dressen and Hertz both say they are fully vaccinated against other diseases. “We are an organization of 36,000 people, 100% vaccinated,” Dressen says. “In reality this is nothing more than a medical condition, and there should absolutely be nothing political about it. It’s been extremely abhorrent and hurtful for people suffering from chronic conditions to have their illnesses politicized.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, that leaves open the question of what the Yale study tells us. Its critics say the answer is not much. The term “post vaccination syndrome” itself is a problem, in Gaffney’s view, because it takes as a given the connection between vaccination and the symptoms. That connection needs to be proved, not assumed, he argues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By assuming the cause-and-effect relationship,” he says, “you seem to give grounding to a new medical diagnosis that may not actually be a proven cause-and-effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s especially so because the described symptoms — chronic fatigue, brain fog, insomnia, and dizziness among them — are not uncommon and often arise from other causes. Indeed, they have often been attributed to long COVID — the lasting symptoms of infection by the COVID virus itself. Not all the PVS group suffered the same symptoms, raising questions about whether PVS can be accurately defined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it happens, the Yale researchers found that 26 of their PVS cohort, or about 62%, had antibodies in their system indicating that they had previously had COVID, but only 15 told the researchers that they had been infected at least once. In the control group of 22 people without symptoms, 46% had the post-infection antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other critics have argued that the sample size is simply too small to extrapolate any of the Yale findings to the population at large. Moreover, the researchers divided their samples into subgroups based on whether they had been previously infected (27 of the PVS cohort group and 11 of the control group) or uninfected (15 of the PVS sample and 11 of the control group). That arguably makes it even harder to apply the findings to the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors don’t disagree that much more extensive research is needed. “This work is still in its early stages, and we need to validate these findings,” Iwasaki told Yale’s publicity department. “But this is giving us some hope that there may be something that we can use for diagnosis and treatment of PVS down the road.... This is far from a final answer on PVS.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That cautionary note may be lost on the anti-vaccine brigade that has taken the study as virtually the last word on the supposed peril of COVID vaccines. In the current partisan environment, the threat to public health from a concerted movement to undermine the public’s trust in science and vaccines is real. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the Yale study sincerely see themselves as heralds of empirical science, whatever the political ramifications. “If we only published research that aligns with prevailing narratives or avoids controversy, we would be failing in our responsibility as scientists,” Krumholz told me. “Our obligation is to pursue the truth, even when it is inconvenient.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if the truth becomes not merely inconvenient, but weaponized by unscrupulous actors in a war against the public interest? Unfortunately, we may now have reached that point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 10:00:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0AFBVV95cUxONnlKekVBZ0NjaVlLQ1BHZTlzYTJmUzNzXzlfSXFXY19mek04MnJvaTl1eVRBbjMwR05zVk5PaDhRZFVqa3RsZ0ZsbHcwc2ZfYXRhSV83MFMwSWt0TXBvLWVxd0xFMXVqZWdsbXYyaVFyVExzZndjT0ljQUU0ZXZqZ3FnR0lHTktKcHNRT0xYMERMX2pVaVVoRHU5cXgzSV9zU2tXZFNteTNNaURNZUdleXNxLU5uTVR5VFpPM1ZidkwwMm5hWE9VYS04alRFWVRx</guid></item><item><title>5 years later: What it's like living with long COVID - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxOQVI1T1lrS3gwbWhlUnZCVDU3WTA4MFhIb0JXTEhWS2VycVgzWWR4ZmhQdXl6cjR1Rmp0VmVJVW15dEN4UVFKWERjbWYyOXNIQTFlb3FfQ05OMzZPZzhycE1HTU9zTTRKNGUtZGsydkdhYXgtdThNZW0waG5iOWN3alJtbVpSVlBadzJGS1NFWjhJRUxpTzFB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;a data-ylk="ct:story;elm:img;itc:0;" class="stretched-box" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/tagged/covid-5-years/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At a time when the world &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/vulnerable-americans-live-shadow-covid-165901780.html" data-ylk="slk:seems eager;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;seems eager&lt;/a&gt; to declare the COVID-19 pandemic a &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/long-covid-problem-world-moving-on-1234988684/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:closed chapter;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;closed chapter&lt;/a&gt;, I — along with millions of other Americans — continue to confront a relentless, invisible enemy that has redefined every aspect of my existence: long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/long-term-effects/index.html#:~:text=Long%20COVID%20is%20a%20serious,years%20after%20COVID%2D19%20illness." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, long COVID — with more than &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/long-covid-more-200-symptoms-090037590.html" data-ylk="slk:200 symptoms;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;200 symptoms&lt;/a&gt; — is defined as “a chronic condition that occurs after SARS-CoV-2 infection and is present for at least 3 months.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03173-6" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; published in Nature Medicine indicates that around 400 million people globally have experienced long COVID, “which is estimated to have an annual economic impact of approximately $1 trillion — equivalent to about 1% of the global economy.” In the United States, over 29% of adults with a prior COVID-19 infection said in an August 2024 &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/long-covid.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:survey;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; that they’ve had long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s been five years since I first came down with symptoms of the coronavirus. In January 2020, before we knew much about the new virus, I was diagnosed with walking pneumonia by the National Health Service in London, where I was living at the time. Soon after, I began noticing nonrespiratory symptoms: gastrointestinal distress, brain fog, fatigue and autonomic nervous system dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="md:hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="mx-auto mb-5 flex flex-col overflow-hidden rounded-xl pb-5 shadow-[0_0_1px_rgba(200,160,251,.63),0_2px_6px_1px_#F3E6FE]"&gt;&lt;h3 class="m-auto block px-4 pb-4 pt-2 text-lg font-bold leading-6"&gt;Trusted news and daily delights, right in your inbox&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="m-auto px-4 pb-4 text-sm font-normal"&gt;See for yourself — The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;By May, the excruciating fatigue and unrelenting brain fog remained, and I was diagnosed with &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326619" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:post-viral syndrome;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;post-viral syndrome&lt;/a&gt; — the precursor diagnosis to long COVID. Two months later, I was on a plane headed for the U.S. in an effort to recover with the help of my family. It wouldn’t be until 2021 that my doctor could officially diagnose me with long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The quest to get better has had its ups and downs, which I’ve documented at length for &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/author/ed-hornick/" data-ylk="slk:Yahoo News;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Yahoo News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At the time, each day was a battle against exhaustion and pain as doctors struggled to pinpoint the cause of my lingering illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Today, I am no closer to finding the answer.

I’m currently enrolled as a subject in a long COVID research study at the renowned Johns Hopkins University, and I’ve taken part in a study by Mount Sinai looking at the effects of the illness on endocrinology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Being included in these studies makes me feel seen and gives a sense that some good may come to others from my misery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="pacing"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pacing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the world was moving on from COVID-19, I was learning about the critical importance of pacing myself. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve experienced energy crashes, which required immediate rest followed by a long recovery.

Walking, swimming and biking became more than just physical activities — with each step, stroke and pedal, I felt a surge of hope. They were symbols of progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the world was moving on from COVID-19, I found that sharing my stories on social media sites was a blessing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a long COVID Facebook group, strangers wrote to me with their own tales. Soon, a community developed. We shared tips, validated each other’s experiences, traded horror stories and reminded one another that we were not alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Meanwhile, I received an outpouring of support from friends, family and important people from the past — like my sixth grade English teacher, Jennifer O’Hare, who frequently checks up on me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="my-4"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Five years later, I stand at a proverbial crossroads. While I do feel better than I did in the earliest days of the pandemic, I’m aware that my journey is far from over. In many ways, it’s just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Looking forward, I am filled with cautious optimism. Research is ongoing, advocacy continues, and as patients, we must keep pushing for recognition, treatment and support. We need more clinical trials, more doctors who specialize in post-viral conditions and more understanding from society as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We are not lazy. We are not making this up.

At the hospital, doctors ordered a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/64093-ct-scan.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/64093-ct-scan.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;computed tomography&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (CT) scan of the patient's neck, which revealed that he had mucus clogging his upper voice box and right-side vocal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patient two, meanwhile, was initially hospitalized for having low salt levels in his blood, which caused tissue swelling. His teeth were also in poor condition, which made it harder for him to eat or drink, leading to weight loss, and he had a chronic cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next: &lt;/strong&gt;When he was admitted to hospital, patient one seemed to be wasting away and had signs of bacterial blood poisoning. An additional CT scan, this time of his chest, showed that he had a buildup of fluid in his &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/52250-lung.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/52250-lung.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lungs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Doctors treated him with antibiotics and briefly put him on ventilation to support his breathing. The medical team later identified traces of fungi in the patient's urine and in coughed-up mucus from his respiratory tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/new-cause-of-asthma-lung-damage-revealed" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/new-cause-of-asthma-lung-damage-revealed"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New cause of asthma lung damage revealed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the hospital, patient two had a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/what-happens-in-your-body-during-a-fever" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/what-happens-in-your-body-during-a-fever"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fever&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius). A CT scan revealed multiple lesions in his chest and abdomen. In addition, traces of fungi were detected in his urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;Both patients — who were not affiliated in any way but were from the same area — were diagnosed with a rare fungal lung infection called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448185/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448185/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;histoplasmosis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Qz2LyZHMyuovPzD2LsfK3f" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Qz2LyZHMyuovPzD2LsfK3f slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This condition occurs when people inhale spores of a harmful fungus named &lt;em&gt;Histoplasma capsulatum&lt;/em&gt;, which usually grows in soil and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dph.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/idph/files/publications/publicationsohpeh-factsheet-histoplasmosis.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="https://dph.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/idph/files/publications/publicationsohpeh-factsheet-histoplasmosis.pdf" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the poop of birds and bats&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Approximately &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/histoplasmosis/php/statistics/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/histoplasmosis/php/statistics/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;1 to 2 people per 100,000 in the United States&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are infected with histoplasmosis each year. However, most people exposed to the fungus &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/histoplasmosis/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/histoplasmosis/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;don't develop any symptoms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Symptoms are more likely to emerge in people with lung conditions or weakened immune systems, compared to the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these two cases, the patients' symptoms may have been exacerbated by other diseases that they had before they developed histoplasmosis&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;For example, patient one had &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/emphysema/symptoms-causes/syc-20355555#:~:text=In%20emphysema%2C%20the%20inner%20walls,that%20causes%20shortness%20of%20breath." target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/emphysema/symptoms-causes/syc-20355555#:~:text=In%20emphysema%2C%20the%20inner%20walls,that%20causes%20shortness%20of%20breath." referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;emphysema&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a common type of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/62616-copd-causes-symptoms-treatment.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/62616-copd-causes-symptoms-treatment.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (COPD) in which air sacs in the lungs are damaged, which constrains breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Microscope image of the fungus that causes histoplasmosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: CDC/Dr. Lucille K. Georg via CDC PHIL)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair also smoked tobacco and cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;Following their diagnoses, the patients were prescribed antifungal drugs to combat their infections. However, despite this treatment, both died. Between 5% and 7% of patients who are hospitalized with histoplasmosis die of their infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;Both patients in these cases were already using or planning to use bat poop as fertilizer to grow cannabis for personal use. Patient one had ordered bat poop — or guano — online, while patient two intended to use guano he'd found in his attic following a bat infestation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/11/12/ofae711/7917418?login=false" target="_blank" data-url="https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/11/12/ofae711/7917418?login=false" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;In a report describing the cases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, doctors noted that various online sources claim that bat guano is a "natural superfood" for cannabis plants because it contains lots of nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Meanwhile, numerous U.S. states have recently legalized the recreational use of cannabis — including &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.azcourts.gov/prop207/Timeline" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.azcourts.gov/prop207/Timeline" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Arizona in 2020&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mpp.org/states/new-york/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mpp.org/states/new-york/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;New York in 2022&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty-and-research/drug-enforcement-and-policy-center/research-and-grants/policy-and-data-analyses/cannabis-crossroads" target="_blank" data-url="https://moritzlaw.osu.edu/faculty-and-research/drug-enforcement-and-policy-center/research-and-grants/policy-and-data-analyses/cannabis-crossroads" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ohio in 2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — which may be encouraging more people to grow their own cannabis, the report authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dangers of using bat guano as fertilizer aren't unique to cannabis — the product would be risky for any gardening, the authors emphasized. But given guano is being marketed for cannabis specifically, there is a need to raise public awareness around the potential risks associated with using the poop in this way, they warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-Qz2LyZHMyuovPzD2LsfK3f-1trdyJPLrHMNPd7IppyVkXfyL5FQj99K" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-Qz2LyZHMyuovPzD2LsfK3f-1trdyJPLrHMNPd7IppyVkXfyL5FQj99K slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                Long COVID patients haven't stopped pushing for more research funding to find treatments for their condition, including this protest in Washington, D.C. in 2022.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;It's been five years since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. But many patients with long COVID have yet to find meaningful recovery.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Around 6% of adults in the U.S. —&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;or roughly 18 million — are estimated to be living with the damaging aftermath of catching the virus, according to research and a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/long-covid.htm" target="_blank"&gt;long-running survey&lt;/a&gt; of U.S households, although numbers are still difficult to pin down because the definitions vary.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And it's not a thing of the past — new patients are still showing up in doctor's offices.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"I think that's one of the biggest misconceptions," says &lt;a href="https://patientresearchcovid19.com/covid19-patient-led-research-team/" target="_blank"&gt;Hannah Davis,&lt;/a&gt; co-founder of the advocacy group, Patient-Led Research Collaborative,&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We've seen so much long COVID in just the last year or two."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Research on long COVID has coalesced around a handful of explanations for what could underpin the illness, but that hasn't yet translated into major breakthroughs for patients who need care.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are still no approved treatments for the condition, which can span many organ systems and symptoms depending on the patient, and can include shortness of breath, brain fog, fatigue and post-exertional malaise, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Under the Biden administration, long COVID patients had pushed &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/11/25/nx-s1-5199994/long-covid-patients-nih-research-treatments" target="_blank"&gt;for more federal funding&lt;/a&gt; and a refocus of research priorities toward treatments.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, patient advocates and scientists have to make their case to new decision-makers, guided by the priorities of the Trump administration — and do so at a moment of turbulence for biomedical sciences with funding imperiled for many institutions.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Regardless of party or political position, long COVID patients have been failed to date by our leaders," says &lt;a href="https://x.com/meighanstone?lang=en" target="_blank"&gt;Meighan Stone&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of the Long COVID Campaign, who's busy lobbying the new administration and Congress.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Stone acknowledges there are certainly some "heartfelt disagreements," between the patient community and Trump's picks to lead federal health agencies, particularly on policies related to curbing the spread of the virus, but she argues patients need to find places where there's common ground.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;don't have the luxury of sitting out the next four years over any ideological differences.&lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Slow progress in research, but promising new trials &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For many patients, the day-to-day reality has not changed dramatically. Finding clinicians who are well-versed in the nuances of long COVID remains challenging, patients say.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The approach to care generally focuses on relieving specific symptoms and related medical conditions that someone develops such as autoimmunity or POTS, says &lt;a href="https://directory.uthscsa.edu/academics/profile/gutierrezm19" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Monica Verduzco-Gutierrez,&lt;/a&gt; chair of rehabilitation medicine at UT Health Science Center San Antonio.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"It is a lot of symptom management right now," she says. "We need significant treatment trials so patients have the possibility of getting a cure."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even though progress has not come nearly fast enough, those involved in long COVID research emphasize there's reason for optimism.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the last year alone, Davis notes scientists have published important work&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07873-4" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;in a variety of areas — on blood clotting, the impacts of exercise, evidence of &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adk3295" target="_blank"&gt;viral persistence&lt;/a&gt; in the spinal cord, and loss of &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.036752" target="_blank"&gt;blood flow&lt;/a&gt; to the brain, to name just a few.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;With this research in hand, the field is &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)00886-9" target="_blank"&gt;now ripe&lt;/a&gt; for a broader push to test different therapies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When trials launched a couple of years ago, there was hope that it would be easy and we would just hit a home run," says &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/michael.peluso" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Michael Peluso&lt;/a&gt;, who runs a large research program on long COVID at the University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The first round of trials that have been reported out have shown this is going to be more complicated — we all sort of expected that."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By Peluso's estimation, there are currently in the neighborhood of 50 drug trials underway for long COVID, a considerable increase from a few years ago when he only counted about a dozen.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have drugs that can target almost every single one of the different mechanisms that we think might be contributing to long COVID, but so far we've launched way too few trials" to thoroughly test them, says Peluso.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;To get there will require more participation from drugmakers, which have largely stayed on the sidelines. Plus, researchers want to identify a biomarker for the illness that can be reliably tracked across multiple trials; and they say a better coordinated clinical trial agenda is needed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Different theories on long COVID's cause&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Viral persistence — the theory that an ongoing infection is hiding out in the body — has featured prominently in some of the early trials, which have leveraged antivirals and monoclonal antibodies in hopes of extinguishing an ongoing infection.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At least half a dozen &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)00886-9" target="_blank"&gt;other mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; may also drive the illness, though.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Among them: Immune dysfunction, the reactivation of dormant viruses like herpes, dysregulation of clotting proteins, and trouble with the microbiome. All of these could be equally, if not more important as viral persistence, and have received less attention in clinical trials up to this point, says Peluso.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Davis is closely following a number of up-and-running trials, led by individual research groups and universities, which are testing immunomodulators, HIV drugs, rapamycin, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), enzymes called nattokinase and lumbrokinase, and other therapies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Private funders &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/02/07/1229724579/scientists-rely-on-private-funding-to-push-long-covid-research-forward" target="_blank"&gt;have stepped&lt;/a&gt; up to back some of these efforts. For example, the non-profit PolyBio Research Foundation has raised millions of dollars to spearhead &lt;a href="https://polybio.org/consortium-project-explorer/" target="_blank"&gt;some of its trials&lt;/a&gt;. The federal government, however, remains pivotal in guiding the broader long COVID agenda, given its role in funding research and eventually greenlighting treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Through the RECOVER initiative, Congress has already poured more than $1 billion into this work and last year appropriated an &lt;a href="https://recovercovid.org/news/nih-adds-funds-long-covid-research-advances-work-new-clinical-trials" target="_blank"&gt;additional $662 million&lt;/a&gt; to be spent in the coming years. About half of that money is supposed to support clinical trials, led by the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A new lobbying push from patients&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ensuring these studies — and the funding for them — continue is the number one priority right now, says Stone of the Long COVID campaign.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;With upheaval across federal health agencies and science funding in doubt, it's hard to know what's in store for an emerging field of research like long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;It's going to take a different type of strategy than we have been doing for the last four years," says Davis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/05/g-s1-51401/nih-director-bhattacharya-nominee" target="_blank"&gt;the nominee to lead the NIH,&lt;/a&gt; both explicitly pledged to support long COVID research during their Senate confirmation hearings.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Stone says Kennedy's focus on chronic diseases — and specifically the president's &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/" target="_blank"&gt;Make America Healthy Again Commission&lt;/a&gt; — could be an opportunity for long COVID patients and those suffering from infection-associated chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Kennedy has indicated he'd like to deprioritize research on infectious diseases and even petitioned to have federal regulators pull the COVID-19 vaccine off the market in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy and Bhattacharya have also heavily criticized measures aimed at mitigating COVID transmission. But many in the long COVID community &lt;a href="https://patientresearchcovid19.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Letter-to-President-Biden-on-Long-COVID-Funding.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;are frustrated&lt;/a&gt; that the ongoing spread of the virus has been normalized and point out that reinfections still carry a risk for long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After taking office, President Trump was quick to disband a long COVID advisory committee that took months to stand-up. That came as a disappointment to Verduzco-Gutierrez, who was a member.

It is positive to see other plant oils being considered in this way as olive oil has been a focus of much research in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The suggestion to switch from butter to plant oils is achievable for many people. However, it was only olive oil that was associated with a lower risk of death due to cardiovascular disease, including &lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/news/stroke/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="stroke" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d064fde4b0e4e5fc190cfb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/news/stroke/" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;.

This is potentially something which could be considered in future studies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, yes.

Off the top of my head, here's a few deceptively big ones:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) We still aren't exactly sure how anesthesia works. We just know it causes certain effects, and they are useful so we use it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) psychiatry is still shockingly infantile in our understanding of human disorders. It's constantly in a state of flux, we don't understand a lot about the meds we currently use, and the diagnostic criteria for disorders still changes as we realize "hey maybe all these behaviors aren't the same source disorder". It's incredibly hard to diagnose when the criteria is largely based on self report and subjective observations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) To a lesser degree than #2, neurology is still learning a lot. It's further because you can observe more objective findings in neuro than psych, but we still struggle a lot with how brains function. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) Immunology. Don't even ask me, because no one knows really. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5) yawns. Still guessing on why that happens too. There's some theories, but that's the best we got.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1j7hi9r/doctors_of_reddit_what_do_we_not_know_about_the/mgxfkc7/" target="_blank"&gt; YoungSerious &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/man-wearing-blue-scrub-suit-and-mask-sitting-on-bench-3279197/" target="_blank"&gt; Jonathan Borba/Unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-6750-5/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8331080"&gt;  &lt;p id="8331080" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/things-people-dont-know-human-body-29-67d00b6ca7d80__700.jpg" alt="A person with dreadlocks lying in bed, contemplating unknown aspects of the human body." title="A person with dreadlocks lying in bed, contemplating unknown aspects of the human body."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;What causes endometriosis and how do you treat it effectively. The leading theory is “retrograde menstruation,” which occurs in 80-90% of women. Ok….. so why do 80-90% of women not have endometriosis? There’s clearly something else going on that we don’t know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, the only way to remove or get rid of endometriosis is through surgery. But there is a high rate of recurrence after surgery.

We don’t know what is supposed to naturally bind to the area that benzodiazepines work at. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Benzodiazepines, BZD, are medications like Xanax and Valium. They produce anti-anxiety effects. And they have a very distinct chemical shape to fit into the BZD site in a group of five proteins. But we don’t know what is supposed to go there. Many medications are analogs of naturally binding molecules that we copy and then use to create an effect.

They are made of 78 copies of a protein called the major vault protein, totalling about three times the size of a ribosome, and larger than most viruses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their function is not totally understood, but it's probably something to do with the nucleus, though analogs of the genes for vaults even appear in bacteria. As they are found in such a wide variety of species, life on Earth must have started making vaults early in its history. The similarity of the genes encoding vault proteins across diverse species would presumably indicate the importance of vaults for viable life, but experiments haven't shown a great deal of harm done to lab animals that had their vault genes knocked out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even stranger, several of the species used in laboratories as model organisms naturally lack vaults. The use of these organisms long predates the discovery of vaults in 1986, with some going back over a century.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1j7hi9r/doctors_of_reddit_what_do_we_not_know_about_the/mgy5eja/" target="_blank"&gt; Gecko99 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/laboratory-worker-doing-tests-15831822/" target="_blank"&gt; Jonathan Borba/Pexels (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-6750-15/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8331077"&gt;  &lt;p id="8331077" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;The brain and especially how it governs our actions and personality..

I would wake up with a raging headache at 4am and barf 2-3 times an hour until 2pm, twice a month. I couldn't eat, drink, take medicine, drive, talk, watch TV, or think. I would spend the day alternating between the bathroom floor or in bed hallucinating from the pain. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I got a daith piercing nearly 4 years ago and it changed my whole life. I can count on one hand the number of times a headache has made me barf since getting the piercing. If I wake up with one, I maybe get sick once, take an extra strength Tylenol, and lie down for an hour, and it's like I never had anything wrong to begin with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edit 2: I feel like migraines are one of the most polarizing health issues.

But I've spent a lot of time in doctors offices. There's a lot of s**t wrong with me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So. I have an illness called idiopathic intracranial hypertension the idiopathic means they don't know why the f**k it happens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, I got it right after I got the Mirena IUD. It turned out a lot of people get it right after they got the Mirena IUD. Enough for a class action law suit it be filed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It got tossed immediatly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, Mirena has listed in the side effects it could cause a stroke, sure, but effect csf? Absolutely not. Not a side effect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But here's my thing. If I go to my gyno right after I get birth control, and say 'hey, I've had a nonstop headache and Im concerned.' they shouldn't wave it off and say it's normal. They should remove it and send you to a neuro to check for a stroke or csf issue, cause it's a possible side effect. But they don't.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And neuros deny birth control could be an iih factor cause IT'S NOT LISTED IN THE OFFICIAL SIDE EFFECTS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But also.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, I got my thyroid removed years and years ago. I'd been on a stable dosage of levothyroxine for like, 6 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I get the Mirena, the csf vein in my brain collapses, and all of a sudden my tsh levels go banana balls. Its like, 7. It had been 1, so, I am no longer absorbing my levothyroxine correctly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My neuro tells me to keep in the Mirena, my endo tells me the Mirena and the iih can't effect the levo absorption, and I'm just... Dying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the course of the year we keep adjusting the levo, and my tsh just is not playing ball. It's just ping ponging wildly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One year after this all starts I just take the Mirena out, against gyno and neuros recommendations. The pain of my neverending headache decreases SIGNIFICANTLY. My tsh levels finally go back to normal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All my doctors just shrug. Oh, what a coincidence. It wasn't the Mirena though. It can't do that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also. When my brain collapsed, I suddenly became intolerant to A LOT of foods. But according to the allergist that doesn't happen. You don't suddenly become allergic to basically everything. She kicked me out. I basically eat the mcas+oral allergy syndrome diet now but honestly help would be good. Brain damage couldn't cause massive food intolerances? Wtf? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also spent two years just... Passing out over and over again every day from the sheer agony of it all. After I finally got neuro surgery I couldn't fall asleep naturally any more. No pain, no sleep. I went to a sleep specialist and he was like 'pain keeps you awake it doesn't put you to sleep. You aren't special'. I don't think they've researched people stuck in a neverending migraine for years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Working with doctors is hell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edit: bonus. I live in Boston. All my doctors were supposed to be at the top of their field. Big wigs. Muckity mucks. Professors at Harvard or tufts or BU.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Phffffffffff.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1j7hi9r/doctors_of_reddit_what_do_we_not_know_about_the/mgz9huw/" target="_blank"&gt; biddily &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-6750-88/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8331047"&gt;  &lt;p id="8331047" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Mental health professional rather than MD, but we still don't know much about the mechanisms of schizophrenia or bipolar.

We don’t know what those “things” specifically are, but there are a lot of indicators it does something big!! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**The Claustrum!**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The theory goes, it’s the part of the brain responsible for actual consciousness!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;…but back to the ADHD part.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2-5% of people have ADHD. If you’re on social media you can tell it’s a lot of people…! Additionally the leading causes of death for people with ADHD are s*****e and murder. That’s right, if you have ADHD, you are more likely to die of s*****e *or* murder than to live to old age… yes. If you have ADHD you literally have an actual disorder that means you’ll either off yourself or get&lt;br&gt; killed by someone else….but I digress….&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What we do know, the Claustrum, lights up with greater activity with people who have ADHD. We know when the Claustrum is inhibited in rats, they kind of just do…whatever…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If one day we understand the Claustrum better, and it turns out that is responsible for ADHD.. that would mean the general public could finally come to understand — especially the parents of ADHD kids (who are significantly more likely to abuse their ADHD children)… that they’re actually mistreating their kids because of a health issue more closely related to *Epilepsy* than just “lack of discipline” or “behavioral problems”. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That shift in thinking would save lives. I hope the purpose of the Claustrum is clearly identified and understood one day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(It also might mean people with ADHD may experience human consciousness very differently, too… and that’s where it gets *really* interesting.).&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1j7hi9r/doctors_of_reddit_what_do_we_not_know_about_the/mgzsm8d/" target="_blank"&gt; obvusthrowawayobv &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-6750-66/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8331039"&gt;  &lt;p id="8331039" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

This just comes first to mind.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1j7hi9r/doctors_of_reddit_what_do_we_not_know_about_the/mgy6t2a/" target="_blank"&gt; Tittyboy_mcgee &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-6750-26/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8331045"&gt;  &lt;p id="8331045" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Another, how babies/young children assimilate so much information so quickly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It cannot (as far as I know) be replicated by a computer.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1j7hi9r/doctors_of_reddit_what_do_we_not_know_about_the/mgx7jh7/" target="_blank"&gt; stuntedmonk &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-6750-32/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8331056"&gt;  &lt;p id="8331056" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Not a doctor, but this was posted a few years ago when the same question was asked:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We still aren't sure what causes precordial catch syndrome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reddit is where I finally put a name to the sporadic chest pain I had in my teens/20s that goes away when you take a deep breath.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1j7hi9r/doctors_of_reddit_what_do_we_not_know_about_the/mgygr8j/" target="_blank"&gt; VulturE &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-6750-43/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8331064"&gt;  &lt;p id="8331064" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Not a doctor but I always find it wild how unsophisticated a lot of surgery is.

class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prescriptions for drugs to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have increased 18% each year since the Covid pandemic, a new study has found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Research from experts at the University of Huddersfield and Aston University suggested there was an upward trend in prescriptions for the condition in each region across England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This could be due to increasing awareness of ADHD via social media, encouranging more people to seek diagnosis and treatment, the project found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, experts warned that "misinformation on these platforms may lead to misconceptions about symptoms, diagnosis and treatment".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A second reason behind the rise in prescriptions could be the "strong association between the impact of the (Covid) pandemic and the worsening of ADHD symptoms," researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The study, which was published in the journal BMJ Mental Health, calculated that prescriptions in England "increased significantly" from 25.17 items per 1,000 population in 2019/20 (before Covid) to 41.55 items in 2023/24, with an average annual increase of 18% nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;English prescribing data was used for the five currently licensed ADHD drugs at national, regional, and NHS integrated care board (ICB) levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Those drugs are the stimulants methylphenidate - such as Ritalin, Concerta and Delmosart - dexamfetamine and lisdexamfetamine and two non-stimulants - atomoxetine and guanfacine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2

methylphenidate remained the most-prescribed medication while lisdexamfetamine showed the highest growth rate (55% annually).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It said there was an upwards trend, but there were variations across the regions with "an average yearly increase ranging from 13% in the North East and Yorkshire region to 28% in the London region". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The experts said use of ADHD medicines in children and adults was supported by "substantial evidence", including that they improved quality of life and ability, and cut substance misuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;People with ADHD are known to suffer inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity, and may struggle to concentrate on a given task, or suffer extreme fidgeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dr Ulrich Muller-Sedgwick, ADHD champion at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said people with the condition need access to timely and effective assessment, "followed by the appropriate treatment".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The right diagnosis and care, including medication and reasonable adjustments, can greatly benefit people's health and support them to reach their full potential at school, university or work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We know that expanding ADHD services through targeted investment would help ensure people receive the vital care they need," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0

is a type of dopamine agonist, which is commonly given to patients in the UK with neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease and RLS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Its side

drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Over the four years while he was taking Ropinirole he said he found himself using gambling websites in the early hours of the morning and he spent all of his and his wife's savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We had another house that we owned, that we rented out, and that was part of our pension plan but we had to sell it to get money back in the bank again," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Along with the gambling, Mr Stevens also engaged in uncontrollable spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"In a short period, I spent £6,500 on fishing equipment," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"None of it seemed wrong, that's the craziness of it,

class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He said it was not until he applied to take part in an MS drug trial that he realised something was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He said a consultant during the trial told him to stop taking Ropinirole  "immediately".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr Stevens said he researched the drug online and found other cases where people had struggled with addiction linked to dopamine agonists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Angharad Vaughan, a solicitor with Leigh Day, represented Mr Stevens when he took legal action against his GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She said the first case like this which she settled was in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"My hope is that these cases will shine a light on the issue and patient safety will improve as a result," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr Stevens said he was not aware how much he had spent until he went through his accounts with Ms Vaughan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I just cried my eyes out, I just could not believe what I had done," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

independently as a GP in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Restless leg syndrome will specifically be included in the updated GP curriculum, due to take effect from August 2025," he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The ropinirole medication Mr Stevens took is sold under the brand name Requip and was manufactured by Glaxo Smyth Kleine (GSK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A GSK spokesperson said "Extensive clinical trials and more than 17 million patient treatments worldwide since 1996 have continued to show Requip to be an effective treatment for Parkinon's disease and restless legs syndrome, with a well-characterised safety profile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"As with all medicines, Requip has potential side effects and these are clearly stated in the prescribing information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Patients should only take Requip under the direction of a medical professional."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Reflecting on his experience, Mr Stevens said: "I'm not saying don't take it, I don't have any right to say that but what I would say, if you're in a position where a doctor was to prescribe you that medication, ask the questions, get all the information and then make that informed choice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p

class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Phil Stevens, from Hampshire, said he developed an addiction to gambling and spending after taking prescription medication for restless leg syndrome (RLS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The 66-year-old has said he is now reluctant to take anything for the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He claimed his GP

is a type of dopamine agonist, which is commonly given to patients in the UK with neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease and RLS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Its side

class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Speaking from the home he shares with his wife in Ringwood, Mr Stevens admitted he did occasionally bet before he took the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Over the four years while he was taking Ropinirole he said he found himself using gambling websites in the early hours of the morning and he spent all of his and his wife's savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We had another house that we owned, that we rented out, and that was part of our pension plan but we had to sell it to get money back in the bank again," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Along with the gambling, Mr Stevens also engaged in uncontrollable spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"In a short period, I spent £6,500 on fishing equipment," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"None of it seemed wrong, that's the craziness of it,

class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He said it was not until he applied to take part in an MS drug trial that he realised something was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He said a consultant during the trial told him to stop taking Ropinirole  "immediately".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr Stevens said he researched the drug online and found other cases where people had struggled with addiction linked to dopamine agonists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Angharad Vaughan, a solicitor with Leigh Day, represented Mr Stevens when he took legal action against his GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She said the first case like this which she settled was in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"My hope is that these cases will shine a light on the issue and patient safety will improve as a result," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr Stevens said he was not aware how much he had spent until he went through his accounts with Ms Vaughan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I just cried my eyes out, I just could not believe what I had done," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

independently as a GP in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Restless leg syndrome will specifically be included in the updated GP curriculum, due to take effect from August 2025," he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The ropinirole medication Mr Stevens took is sold under the brand name Requip and was manufactured by Glaxo Smyth Kleine (GSK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A GSK spokesperson said "Extensive clinical trials and more than 17 million patient treatments worldwide since 1996 have continued to show Requip to be an effective treatment for Parkinon's disease and restless legs syndrome, with a well-characterised safety profile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"As with all medicines, Requip has potential side effects and these are clearly stated in the prescribing information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Patients should only take Requip under the direction of a medical professional."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Reflecting on his experience, Mr Stevens said: "I'm not saying don't take it, I don't have any right to say that but what I would say, if you're in a position where a doctor was to prescribe you that medication, ask the questions, get all the information and then make that informed choice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p

	&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Measles continues to spread in West Texas and New Mexico, with more than 250 people infected — many unvaccinated school-age children. &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/news---events/newsroom/2025/first-cases-of-measles-in-oklahoma-reported.html"&gt;Two cases in Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, for which state officials have not provided a location, have also been linked to these outbreaks. Eleven other states have reported isolated measles cases, typically linked to  international travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block" aria-label="graphic"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-rhgw2n g-margin-inline"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-rhgw2n"&gt; &lt;div class="g-wrapper_hed g-text-align-left svelte-1yj9fcz"&gt;&lt;h3 class="g-heading svelte-1yj9fcz g-has-leadin"&gt;Measles cases by county in 2025&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class="g-leadin svelte-1yj9fcz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;●&lt;/span&gt; Isolated cases   &lt;span&gt;●&lt;/span&gt; Outbreaks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-rhgw2n g-margin-inline"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-rhgw2n"&gt; &lt;div class="g-wrapper_meta g-text-align-left svelte-v3m00m"&gt; &lt;p class="g-source svelte-v3m00m"&gt;Source: State health departments; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="g-note svelte-v3m00m"&gt;Note: Reported measles cases as of March 11.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;The Texas outbreak began in late January,  when local health officials reported two cases in Gaines County, a rural agricultural area on the western edge of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;The outbreak quickly escalated. Measles has spread into neighboring counties and infected at least &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;223 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; as of Tuesday, including 29 people who have been hospitalized and an &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/texas-measles-outbreak-death.html"&gt;unvaccinated young child who died&lt;/a&gt;, the first such death in the United States in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;New Mexico also &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/"&gt;declared an outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in Lea County, which borders Gaines County. While the cases in New Mexico have not officially been connected to the Texas outbreak, officials have said they are “undoubtedly related.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block" aria-label="graphic"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-rhgw2n g-margin-inline"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-rhgw2n"&gt; &lt;p class="g-wrapper_hed g-text-align-left svelte-1yj9fcz"&gt;&lt;h3 class="g-heading svelte-1yj9fcz "&gt;Measles outbreaks in Texas and New Mexico&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-rhgw2n g-margin-inline"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-rhgw2n"&gt; &lt;div class="g-wrapper_meta g-text-align-left svelte-v3m00m"&gt;  &lt;p class="g-note svelte-v3m00m"&gt;Reported measles cases for Texas and New Mexico counties as of March 11.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Last week, an unvaccinated resident of Lea County who &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/health/measles-death-new-mexico.html"&gt;tested positive for the virus died&lt;/a&gt;, though officials have not yet confirmed that measles was the cause of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;In both states, most measles cases have spread among people who are unvaccinated or with unknown vaccine status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;For years, Gaines County has had low childhood vaccination rates, largely because of the area’s large Mennonite community. While there is no religious doctrine that explicitly forbids vaccines, the insular Christian group has historically avoided interacting with the health care system and has a long tradition of using home remedies and supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Roughly 82 percent of the kindergarten students in the county had received the measles-mumps-rubella vaccination, or M.M.R., last year, which is far below the 95 percent coverage needed to prevent outbreaks in a community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Texas public schools require children to have received certain vaccines, including the M.M.R. shot, but parents can apply for an exemption for “reasons of conscience,” including religious beliefs. Last year, Gaines County had one of the highest exemption rates in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Vaccination rates can vary widely by school district. The Loop Independent School District in Gaines County is a small district with one school and the lowest rate of measles vaccination in the affected Texas counties. Only 46 percent of kindergarten students had received their M.M.R. vaccine in the 2023 school year, down from 82 percent in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block" aria-label="graphic"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-rhgw2n g-margin-inline"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-rhgw2n"&gt; &lt;div class="g-wrapper_hed g-text-align-left svelte-1yj9fcz"&gt;&lt;h3 class="g-heading svelte-1yj9fcz g-has-leadin"&gt;Change in measles vaccination rates in affected Texas counties&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p class="g-leadin svelte-1yj9fcz"&gt;By county, for public school districts and private schools, since 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-rhgw2n g-margin-inline"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-rhgw2n"&gt; &lt;div class="g-wrapper_meta g-text-align-left svelte-v3m00m"&gt; &lt;p class="g-source svelte-v3m00m"&gt;Source: Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="g-note svelte-v3m00m"&gt;Chart shows the change in reported vaccination rates among kindergarten students in public school districts and private schools from 2019–20 to 2023–24. Homeschooled children are not included in this data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;In Lea County, N.M., the M.M.R. vaccination rate for children and teens is relatively high, at about 94 percent. But the rate among adults is much lower: 63 percent have received one shot of M.M.R., and only 55 percent have received both shots, according to local health officials, though they noted that there may be vaccinated adults whose records have not been added to the system. Adults make up more than half of reported cases in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious known infections. In a hypothetical community where nobody had immunity from the virus and each infected person infected 18 others, a small outbreak would quickly grow out of control:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Every vaccinated person would help slow the spread of the virus and limit the outbreak:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;For the outbreak to end quickly, each infected person would need to infect fewer than one other person, on average. In this example, 17 of 18 people would need to be vaccinated — more than 94 percent of the community:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;And while measles symptoms often resolve on their own within a few weeks, the virus can be extremely dangerous in rare cases. It may cause pneumonia, making it difficult for children to get oxygen into their lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;The infection can also lead to brain swelling, which can cause lasting damage, including blindness, deafness and intellectual disabilities. For every 1,000 children who get measles, one or two will die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;The virus also causes “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/health/measles-vaccine-immune-system.html"&gt;immune amnesia&lt;/a&gt;,” making the body unable to defend itself against illnesses it has already been exposed to and leaving patients more susceptible to future infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Once someone is infected with the virus, doctors have little control over how serious a measles infection becomes — there is no antiviral for measles to stop its spread in the body, only “supportive care” to help manage symptoms. That’s why experts recommend that people get two doses of the M.M.R. vaccine, which are 97 percent effective at preventing infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Measles was officially declared eliminated — which means the virus is not continually spreading — in 2000, in large part because of aggressive vaccination campaigns. Experts now fear that status may be at risk, as &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/13/upshot/vaccination-rates.html"&gt;childhood vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; have been falling nationally.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;A D.C.-area pediatrician is warning about the dangers of so called “measles parties” that are being held to build children’s immunity to the virus. This comes as an outbreak in &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/national/2025/03/measles-cases-are-still-rising-in-texas-heres-what-you-should-know-about-the-contagious-virus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cases has been seen across the country, including Texas,&lt;/a&gt; among children and adults not vaccinated against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think people forget we had a child recently die in 2025 of measles,” said Dr. Gabrina Dixon, a pediatrician at Children’s National Hospital. “I always say prevention is key. You don’t want to get the illness, you want to prevent it. And the way to prevent it is with vaccination.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While no instances of “measles parties” have been reported around the D.C. region, Texas, which is seeing most of the cases, has warned against the practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, measles cases were considered eradicated in the year 2000 due to the use of vaccinations. Now, the number of vaccinated kindergartners has dropped below &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;95% and decreasing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You don’t have to believe what people say, but numbers do not lie, and we see that in communities where there are really low vaccination rates, people are getting measles,” Dixon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One belief behind exposing a child to others with an illness to build their immunity could be the belief by some that a vaccine can also give someone an illness. Dixon said that is “a false narrative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone comes down with an illness shortly after receiving a vaccine, Dixon said it is most likely due to them catching the illness before the vaccine can fully kick in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It takes vaccines usually up to two weeks for your body to build a defense, to fight whatever the vaccine is trying to prevent,” Dixon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said it’s especially concerning to expose young children whose parents may not know their child’s full health picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It can lead to the death of that child because they’re immunocompromised or a really severe illness causing them to be hospitalized,” she said. “The only party we should be doing is getting the vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials in the D.C. region have warned about one case of measles in Maryland, which involved someone who &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/local/2025/03/measles-case-confirmed-in-howard-co-resident-who-passed-through-dulles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;traveled through Dulles International Airport,&lt;/a&gt; presenting a risk of possible exposure to others around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The symptoms of measles, according to Dixon, are cold-like in the beginning — a high fever, runny nose, cough, watery eyes — then a telltale rash will appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dixon encourages individuals to get vaccinated against measles, if they haven’t been already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood work can be used to determine if someone is protected if they are unsure whether they were vaccinated as children. For adults, anyone who was vaccinated before 1968 may need a measles booster, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

It is a key part of reducing your risk of heart disease, stroke and other serious health issues.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; When thinking about &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-lower-blood-pressure-8611460" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;ways to support healthy blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, a heart-healthy diet and exercise may come to mind, which isn’t wrong. But it’s not just about what you do by day. Your nighttime routine plays a bigger role in your heart health than you might think.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s right! Getting ready for bed might feel like an ordinary part of your day, but did you know certain bedtime steps may be powerful medicine for better blood pressure? We spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.conehealth.com/find-a-doctor/doctor-profile/mary-branch/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mary Branch, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist at Cone Health in Greensboro, North Carolina, about how to make the most of those precious pre-sleep moments to support healthy blood pressure. And trust us, it’s easier than you’d expect (no burpees required!). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before you hit the pillow tonight, try these five simple yet effective tips to give your blood pressure a little extra love.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-limit-alcohol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Limit Alcohol  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For some people, unwinding at the end of the day might include sipping on a boozy nightcap. However, if you have high blood pressure, cutting back on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/alcohol-and-your-health-11685623" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;alcohol &lt;/a&gt;is especially important, says Branch. “For women, it is recommended to drink no more than one drink per day, and two for men,” she says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While alcohol may feel relaxing in the moment, it can actually make it harder to manage your blood pressure over time. Even small amounts can interfere with medications or put additional strain on your heart and blood vessels. And the more you drink, the higher your blood pressure rises. The link is so strong that one study found that each additional daily drink a person had significantly increased their systolic and diastolic blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news? By swapping that nightcap for something like herbal tea, such as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8067374/chamomile-tea-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chamomile tea&lt;/a&gt;, or simply sticking to water, you’re doing your body a huge favor. In addition to helping promote more stable blood pressure, you’ll give your body a hydration boost, too. Just go for caffeine-free beverage options, as caffeine may make it hard to sleep. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-remember-your-medication"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Remember Your Medication &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you’re prescribed medications to treat hypertension, it is recommended that you take these medications each day,” says Branch. This includes medications you may need to take before bed. Yes, even on nights when you feel too tired to open a pill bottle. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adhering to prescribed hypertension medications is crucial for effectively managing blood pressure and reducing the risk of serious health complications, such as heart attacks and strokes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Consistency is key, as these medications work best when maintained at steady levels in your system. Skipping a dose can disrupt this balance and potentially hinder progress. Incorporating daily reminders, such as setting an alarm or using a pill organizer, can help ensure you take your medications on time. Simple steps like keeping your medications within reach, like near your bedside or in a spot you frequent, can make it easier to stay on track—even on those long days when opening a pill bottle feels like a chore.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-practice-mindfulness"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Practice Mindfulness &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Branch suggests that practicing meditation and mindfulness may be a helpful bedtime habit for healthy blood pressure. “This can help bring down your stress level and your blood pressure along with it,” she says. “Furthermore, it can help you with getting a good night’s rest, which is also important for reducing blood pressure.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Scientific data supports these recommendations. Research highlights the link between &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8051058/does-stress-cause-high-blood-pressure/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stress and higher blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, illustrating the importance of addressing stress for overall health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; By taking small but intentional steps toward relaxation before bed, you can set yourself up for restful sleep and a healthier tomorrow. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some additional ways to manage stress before bed include practicing yoga or gentle stretching to ease muscle tension, journaling to clear your mind, and creating a calming bedtime environment by reducing noise and dimming lights.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Establishing a consistent bedtime routine can further signal to your body that it’s time to wind down, creating a seamless transition to restful sleep.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-avoid-high-sodium-snacks"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Avoid High-Sodium Snacks  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Late-night snacking can be tempting. But if you’re aiming to support healthy blood pressure, it’s crucial to steer clear of high-sodium foods before bed. Consuming salty snacks like chips, canned soups or pretzels may cause your body to retain water. This can increase the pressure on your blood vessels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, keeping your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/thing-to-avoid-if-you-have-high-blood-pressure-8700143" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sodium &lt;/a&gt;intake in check, especially before sleep, may help stabilize your blood pressure overnight and promote better overall cardiovascular health. Opt for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/low-sodium-snacks-dietitians-love-8775716" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;low-sodium snacks &lt;/a&gt;like fresh fruit, unsalted nuts or air-popped popcorn. They’ll satisfy your evening cravings without compromising your blood pressure.

Keep Your Bedroom Cool, Dark and Comfortable  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Creating the right sleep environment can have a surprising impact on healthy blood pressure levels. A cool, dark, comfortable bedroom not only promotes better sleep but also may support heart health by encouraging quality sleep. Conversely, data suggests that poor sleep can lead to elevated blood pressure over time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To keep your bedroom comfortable, ensure your room is dark, quiet and cool.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Eliminating distractions such as bright lights or loud noises and investing in a supportive mattress and pillow may also encourage deeper, more restorative sleep. These small adjustments may help your body relax and recover from the day, contributing to better blood pressure regulation.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Certain healthy bedtime habits can have a significant impact on your blood pressure. And developing these habits doesn’t have to feel overwhelming or complicated. Simple strategies like limiting alcohol, taking your blood pressure medication, practicing mindfulness, avoiding high-sodium snacks and creating a comfortable sleep environment can all help promote better blood pressure. In addition to tried-and-true methods for supporting blood pressure, like exercise and a healthy diet, these easy, proactive steps can help lower blood pressure and improve heart health. Remember, the path to better well-being often starts with small, intentional changes. By prioritizing these pre-sleep practices, you’ll not only support your blood pressure but also enhance your overall quality of life, one restful night at a time.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking annual injection designed to protect against Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has successfully passed an important early safety trial. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers have shared that the drug lenacapavir prevents the virus from replicating inside cells. If further testing proves successful, this could become the longest-lasting form of HIV prevention available.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Currently, individuals at risk of HIV can take daily pills or receive injections every eight weeks as part of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although highly effective, the need for regular doses can be challenging. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The prospect of a once-a-year injection could significantly improve accessibility and adherence to HIV prevention methods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-yearly-hiv-dose"&gt;A yearly HIV dose&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the initial trial, 40 participants who did not have HIV received a single muscle injection of lenacapavir. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results showed no major side effects or safety concerns. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, traces of the medication remained in their bodies after 56 weeks, suggesting its potential as an annual PrEP option.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future trials will need to involve a more diverse group of participants, researchers emphasized at the 2025 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, they remain optimistic about the drug’s potential. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As they noted, “Yearly dosing of lenacapavir has the potential to further decrease current barriers to PrEP by increasing the uptake of, persistence on, and, therefore, scalability of PrEP.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This development could play a key role in global efforts to curb the HIV epidemic. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), around 39.9 million people are currently living with HIV, with 65% of cases in the African region. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations like WHO, the Global Fund and UNAIDS are working to improve access to HIV-prevention medicines in hopes of ending the epidemic by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lenacapavir-brings-hope"&gt;Lenacapavir brings hope&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lenacapavir’s success in early trials has sparked excitement among HIV advocacy groups. Richard Angell, from the Terrence Higgins Trust, called the results “as exciting as they are transformational.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“PrEP as a daily pill has been a game-changer in our HIV response,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The prospect of ‘safe’ annual injectable PrEP is as exciting as it is transformational. It’s great to see these early results that suggest injectable PrEP might be effective for up to 12 months. We need to get ready for its rollout now and fund sexual-health clinics to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This statement reflects a growing demand for more convenient HIV prevention options that could reach more people and simplify treatment plans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inequalities-in-prep-access"&gt;Inequalities in PrEP access&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the effectiveness of PrEP, access to these &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/lists/7-plants-transform-modern-medicine" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;medications&lt;/a&gt; has been uneven. Angell highlighted existing disparities, stating, “The oral pill is still not available in prisons, online or in community pharmacy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He also pointed out regional differences in PrEP availability, noting that while Scotland has approved two-monthly PrEP injections, England still awaits the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) approval.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With ongoing advancements in HIV prevention, experts hope that new long-acting treatments like lenacapavir can bridge these gaps and make protection more widely available. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If further &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/health/poop-pill-trial-for-cancer" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt; confirm its effectiveness, this annual injection could revolutionize the fight against HIV, making prevention easier and more accessible for millions worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)00405-2/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt; medical journal.&lt;/p&gt;

"As this investigation is ongoing, potential other exposures are also being assessed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state's first two measles cases this year have been in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child was unvaccinated but did not attend daycare or school while infectious, according to the Suffolk County Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State health officials said the child had recently traveled "outside of the U.S."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials declined to give the age of the infected child, other than to say they were under 5. Since children generally receive their first measles vaccination between the age of 12 and 15 months, babies are usually unvaccinated for their first year of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2024, a child under 5 from Nassau County was also treated at Cohen's for measles. It wasn't clear how that child contracted the disease and they had not been traveling overseas, where measles is more common. The child recovered and was released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before that, the most recent Long Island measles cases were in 2019, when there were three in Nassau and one in Suffolk, according to state health department data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new Suffolk case has not been linked to measles outbreaks elsewhere in the United States, the health department said. The majority of cases have been reported in Texas, where 223 people have tested positive for measles, including one school-aged child who died from the disease. That child had not received a measles vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen Children’s Medical Center is working with health officials "under established exposure protocols to ensure no further cases arise from this incident," according to a hospital statement emailed to Newsday on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Measles can be very serious. It’s much more than just a rash as complications can include pneumonia and inflammation of the brain, and often results in hospitalization," New York State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said in a statement. "The most important thing people can do to protect themselves is to ensure they've been properly immunized against measles and immediately get a shot if they are not."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can be spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can live up to 2 hours in the air even after an infected person leaves, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms, such as high fever, cough and red eyes start 7 to 14 days after a person is infected, followed by a distinctive red rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One dose of the measles vaccine, which is given between 12 and 15 months, gives you about 93% protection," said Dr. Matthew Harris, who works in emergency medicine at Cohen Children's Medical Center. "The second dose, which is given between 4 and 6 years, gets it up to about 97%."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harris said a very small percentage of children who are fully vaccinated get measles and if they do it is a much more mild form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no treatment for measles, the best we can offer is supportive care," Harris said. "It can cause a devastating pneumonia, it can cause a form of encephalitis that is irreversible and we also know that measles has longstanding impact on your immune system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told NewsdayTV Tuesday: "Measles was nearly eradicated in the early 2000s. The emergence of measles here in New York and in many states around the country is highly concerning because there are many children who are at extraordinarily high risk for complications of measles, namely those under the age of 1."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before a measles vaccine became available in 1963, about three to four million Americans were infected with measles every year, 400 to 500 people died and 48,000 were hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With David Olson and AP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Lisa L.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cheese can help you feel more satisfied on a reduced calorie diet. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mozzarella, swiss, ricotta and cottage cheese are higher in protein, and feta can be used in smaller amounts thanks to its strong flavor. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Being mindful of the protein, fat and calorie content can help you select a cheese that supports your weight loss efforts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cheese is unlikely to be the first food to come to mind when it comes to weight loss. Because of its calorie density, recommended portion sizes are often small, making it feel like a food that doesn’t deserve a spot on your plate. The good news? This isn’t true. In fact, not only can cheese be included in a diet for weight loss, but it can be beneficial to do so too! 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cheese is a source of important nutrients, including protein, which helps you feel full after meals, and minerals, like calcium and phosphorus. “Plus, cheese adds flavor to meals, so you don’t feel deprived while cutting calories,” says&lt;a href="https://kelseyandcooperskitchen.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Kelsey Sackmann, MS, RD&lt;/a&gt;. The key is learning which cheeses to choose and how to incorporate them into your eating plan.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Any cheese can fit into a diet plan that’s customized to meet your needs. That said, five types of cheese stand out for being particularly helpful if you’re trying to lose weight. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Cottage Cheese &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Thanks to its high protein content, dietitians commonly recommend cottage cheese for people trying to lose weight. “A 1-cup serving of low-fat (1%) cottage cheese provides approximately 28 grams of protein,” says&lt;a href="https://nutritionbymandy.com/about-mandy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Mandy Tyler M.Ed., RD, CSSD, LD&lt;/a&gt;. That’s well above the amount found in most other cheeses making it a good choice if you’re looking to boost your protein intake. Protein helps keep you full for longer and is essential for building and maintaining muscle mass, a key component to weight loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “In addition, cottage cheese contains calcium and phosphorus, important nutrients for strong bones,” says Tyler. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are many ways to include cottage cheese in your diet.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Mozzarella cheese is a semi-soft cheese commonly made from cow’s or buffalo’s milk. It’s a good choice for weight loss because it’s relatively low in calories compared to other cheeses with a similar amount of protein. One ounce of&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7937030/is-mozzarella-cheese-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; mozzarella&lt;/a&gt; contains 6 grams of protein and just 85 calories, whereas the same amount of mild cheddar has 7 grams of protein and 110 calories.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you're on a weight loss journey and are trying to watch your intake of fats, you can even opt for reduced-fat or fat-free mozzarella cheeses,” says&lt;a href="https://www.thedietitiandish.com/about-me" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Patricia Kolesa MS, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. Mozzarella is most commonly used in Italian cuisine, like pasta and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/17976/main-dishes/pizza/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;pizza&lt;/a&gt;, but it pairs just as well with crackers and fruit.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Feta cheese is a soft cheese traditionally made from sheep’s or goat’s milk. It’s a staple in Greek cuisine but has a range of culinary uses. One ounce of feta contains 75 calories, 6 grams of fat and 4 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Similar to other cheeses, feta is a good source of calcium, a nutrient that benefits bone health. “Feta cheese can be a good choice for individuals looking to lose weight, as it is lower in both calories and fat than many other cheese varieties,” says Tyler.  “In addition, feta cheese has a strong flavor, thus a small amount can be used to enhance the overall flavor of the meal.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Swiss cheese is a hard cheese made from cow’s milk. It has a strong flavor and unique appearance, often containing holes of various sizes. One ounce of swiss cheese has 111 calories, 9 grams of fat and 8 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Its slightly higher protein content makes it a good choice for weight loss as it may be more filling than cheeses with less protein per ounce. Notably, Swiss is also low in sodium with just 53 mg per ounce, making it a potentially good choice for those following a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/category/4302/low-sodium-meal-plans/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;low-sodium diet&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ricotta cheese is actually not a cheese at all. Instead, it’s made from whey, a byproduct of the cheese making process. From a culinary standpoint, ricotta is treated as a cheese and can be enjoyed similarly to other soft cheeses, like cottage cheese or mascarpone. Ricotta cheese is typically made from cow’s or goat’s milk and is a good source of protein. One ½-cup serving of whole milk ricotta contains 186 calories, 13 grams of fat and 9 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Choose a higher-protein cheese &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; All cheese contains protein, but some contain higher amounts than others. For example, cottage cheese is a significant source of protein and can be used as the primary protein source in a meal or snack. Other cheeses, like feta and mozzarella, contribute protein to a meal but are unlikely to offer enough as a standalone source. Cheeses that are high in protein can help with satiety, meaning you’ll stay full longer. This is especially helpful if you’re following a reduced calorie diet. “Protein digests at a slower rate, helping us feel fuller for longer and less likely to overeat later in the day,” says Kolesa.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Be mindful of fat content &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cheese is naturally high in fat, though some cheeses are available in low- or non-fat varieties. While higher fat foods are often higher in calories, it should be noted that dietary fat intake is essential for nutrient absorption and satiety. If you’re trying to lose weight, Tyler recommends being mindful of portion sizes and considering low-fat options to help stay within your daily calorie goal.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Limit highly processed cheeses &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cutting back on ultra-processed foods may benefit weight loss—including highly processed cheeses. “There’s no need to blacklist any cheese, but some—like processed cheeses and high fat, creamy varieties—pack in extra calories, additives and fewer nutrients,” says Sackmann. Examples of ultra-processed cheeses include “spray canned cheeses, cream cheese and American cheese,” says Kolesa. “These cheese types [may] contain added sugars and sodium, which can make it harder to lose weight and [may] increase the risk of other chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers,” she adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Enjoy cheese with fiber-rich or protein-rich foods &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; From a nutritional and weight loss perspective, cheese is best when paired with high-fiber or high-protein foods. “If weight loss is the goal, stick to portions sizes, add fiber to it and use it as a vehicle for flavor,” says Sackmann. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains and beans are high in fiber and can be easily combined with cheese for a more balanced meal or snack. You can try this combination in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8078448/cottage-cheese-snack-jar/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cottage Cheese Snack Jar&lt;/a&gt;, which provides 20 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber to help keep you full until your next meal.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While cheese is considered a calorie-dense food, it can certainly have a place in a weight loss eating pattern. Cheeses like mozzarella, swiss, ricotta and cottage cheese are higher in protein, helping you feel full for longer, while feta cheese can be used in smaller amounts thanks to its strong flavor. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to providing protein, including cheese in your diet can also help make your meals more satisfying. “Many people enjoy cheese [for] both the flavors and the creamy texture, so finding ways to include it in your eating plan when trying to lose weight could help you stick to that eating plan much better than [if you try] banning cheese [altogether],” says&lt;a href="https://heidimcindoord.com/#about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Heidi McIndoo, MS, RD&lt;/a&gt;. By being mindful of protein, fat and calorie content, you’ll find that it’s possible to lose weight while enjoying all the benefits cheese has to offer

In addition to these foods, you might also try &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-probiotics/" target="_self"&gt;probiotic supplements&lt;/a&gt;. Look for labeling that reads, "contains live cultures" or "contains active cultures" in these common probiotic foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Yogurt&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A staple probiotic food, go for yogurt with live and active cultures. Some yogurts are specifically marketed for their probiotic content or to help improve digestion. Yogurt usually has &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/want-probiotics-but-dislike-yogurt-try-these-foods-202107142918" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;L. acidophilus bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, which can promote the growth of good bacteria in your gut. Yogurt is a great option because it's widely available, comes in a variety of flavors to suit your taste and can be eaten straight from the container.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Kimchi&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kimchi is a traditional Korean side dish made by fermenting vegetables with probiotic lactic acid bacteria. Kimchi can give you that probiotic punch, and it's made with healthy ingredients like vegetables (most commonly Napa cabbage, carrots, scallions and radish), garlic, red pepper powder, ginger and other spices. It makes a wonderful side and is traditionally served with steamed rice. Kimchi is associated with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24456350/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;research regarding&lt;/a&gt; anti-cancer, anti-obesity, colorectal health, cholesterol reduction, anti-aging, brain health, immune health and skin health properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Pickles&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might be surprised to learn that &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-super-healthy-probiotic-foods#TOC_TITLE_HDR_13" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;pickles&lt;/a&gt; can contain probiotics. You just have to make sure you buy fermented pickles, which are usually found in the refrigerated section of the health food aisle. Some brands even advertise probiotic content. They trend under the term "healthy pickles," but be sure to read the labels to ensure they contain probiotics. You can even make them at home. Some people also drink or use the juice the pickles are fermented in. Note that jarred pickles tend to be high in sodium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Sourdough&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sourdough starter contains lactic acid bacteria. The starter is the environment where yeast and good bacteria grow by consuming water and flour. Natural prebiotics and probiotics are listed in research as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8306212/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;one of the benefits&lt;/a&gt; of sourdough bread. It's also linked to better blood glucose control, reduced cholesterol, a lower risk of diabetes, reduced cardiovascular disease risk and improved weight control. Also, it makes a pretty good sandwich bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Kefir&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kefir is a fermented milk made using kefir grain. It starts as a normal cow's or goat's milk, and then a grain-like yeast and lactic acid bacterial colony called kefir is added to the milk. The mixture is left to ferment for around a day and then the milk is filtered from the grains, creating the kefir drink. The resulting drink is a &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/9-health-benefits-of-kefir#TOC_TITLE_HDR_3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;powerful probiotic&lt;/a&gt; that actually packs more probiotics than yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Kombucha&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kombucha is "a go-to for fermented botanicals," Barkyoumb says. "This magic potion has been dubbed the 'immortal health elixir' because of its ability to support whole-body health and wellness while preventing illnesses. High-quality kombucha is filled with probiotics and amino acids that will help your body digest sugar, and is also a great natural hangover cure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This drink is actually a fermented tea, so you're getting the health benefits of tea with the probiotic boost of a fermented beverage. It's made by adding strains of bacteria, yeast and sugar to either black or green tea, which leads to the drink's probiotic-happy environment. It ferments for about a week or more until it grows a mushroom-type texture on top. The mushroom gets filtered out to make new kombucha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. Sauerkraut&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This German comfort food is fermented cabbage made by lacto-fermenting the vegetable in its brine with salt. As part of the traditional fermentation process, probiotics are in &lt;a href="https://ffhdj.com/index.php/ffhd/article/view/262#link={%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://ffhdj.com/index.php/ffhd/article/view/262%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22probiotics%22}" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;the end product&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this is another product where you have to specifically buy probiotic sauerkraut or make your own. Many brands use vinegar and sugar or are pasteurized, which reduces the growth of bacteria and kills probiotics. Common canned sauerkraut is usually made with vinegar or it's pasteurized (or both).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. Miso soup&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Japanese food is served as a side to many meals. Miso is a paste typically made from fermented soybeans and works as a condiment to make sauces, spreads and soup stock. Miso soup uses this paste for the stock. Because miso is a fermented food, it packs &lt;a href="https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(16)33413-8/fulltext" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;the probiotic punch&lt;/a&gt;. Miso soup works great with larger meals but it also makes a nice, light lunch on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9. Apple cider vinegar&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/4-surprising-health-benefits-of-apple-cider-vinegar/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apple cider vinegar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is twice-fermented apple juice. Apple cider vinegar has been making its rounds for years as a popular health supplement. It has natural probiotics from the fermentation process. Though its benefits &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/exploring-the-health-benefits-of-apple-cider-vinegar" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;need further research&lt;/a&gt;, many people also use it for everything from calming acid reflux to weight loss. It has a strong flavor, so if you don't like taking it directly, add it to salad dressing, marinades or pickling liquid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10. Some cheese&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain types of cheese have probiotics. For instance, aged cheeses &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/exploring-the-health-benefits-of-apple-cider-vinegar" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;that are not heated&lt;/a&gt; afterward tend to have probiotics. Examples include Swiss, Gouda, cheddar, Edam, Gruyère, cottage cheese and provolone. The good news is that many popular cheese types have probiotics, including a healthy bowl of cottage cheese topped with fruit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;11. Pickled vegetables&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along the same lines as the kimchi and pickles above, you can also look for any pickled vegetables that specifically list having probiotics. One idea is to look into lacto-fermented escabeche, a pickled dish from Mexico that can contain a wide variety of vegetables. Or you can make a fermented giardiniera, an Italian pickle relish. Using fermented pickled vegetables is also a great way to shop locally and preserve vegetables for use out of season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;12. Buttermilk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buttermilk may seem like a drink out of "Little House on the Prairie," but traditional buttermilk can be an excellent source of probiotics. Buttermilk covers different types of fermented dairy beverages, but traditional buttermilk is the liquid skimmed out of the butter-making process. The trick is to avoid cultured buttermilk, which is the most common type in supermarkets and usually does not have probiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOMjJ0SktEOU1PMVZvMkRyQV9zXzdOTEVSZ3ZZa0NiM3cwMWdKRDhjb0lkdFd4SGFUUDM0am5hUjZWZmhtdDd6YzdpY1pfUXl3eU5HSnYtb0h6ZTM1QUNZb255SXREMXcyeWR0N0lNSXFJQW9fcmNtSW9LMXMtMTlOY0FHTWtfeWVIRjBicGlGUEd6OEVZRWFuYWxrQUxxaDM1dV8wa01n</guid></item><item><title>Measles at LAX: L.A.

County Department of Public Health announced Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a viral infection that spreads through the air and via droplets. It can potentially lead to serious health complications, including death. The virus can spread when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes, or a person can contract it by touching an infected surface, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/what-to-know-about-measles-and-vaccines#:~:text=A%20measles%20outbreak%20in%20the,may%20only%20become%20more%20common." target="_blank"&gt;John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is so contagious, the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; says, you can get measles just by being in a room where an infected person has been — even up to two hours after that person has left the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the second recent case of a measles-infected person exposing others at LAX. Last month, an &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-02-28/first-confirmed-measles-case-in-los-angeles-county-since-2015-how-to-protect-yourself"&gt;infected infant&lt;/a&gt; returning home to Orange County arrived at the airport on a Korean Air flight in Terminal B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials listed the following locations the infected person visited after their flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are at risk of exposure to the recent measles case include: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Travelers who were at the Tom Bradley International Terminal at LAX the evening of March 5 between 7 and 10:40 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who visited Cloud 9 Nail Salon in North Hollywood on March 7 between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. The salon is at 5142 N. Lankershim Blvd.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Customers of Superior Grocers at 10683 Valley Blvd. in El Monte who visited on March 10 between 8:15 and 10:30 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;California now has &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/measles.aspx#:~:text=As%20of%20February%2022%2C%202025%2C%20three%E2%80%8B%20confirmed%20measles%20case,provisional%20and%20subject%20to%20change." target="_blank"&gt;five reported cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; as of March 11 amid an expanding measles outbreak in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are 222 cases across the nation in states that include Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas and Washington, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All measles cases diagnosed in California thus far were of infected people who traveled internationally, the county health department stated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 17% of cases nationwide have required hospitalization for management of measles complications or for the purpose of isolation, and two people have died from complications of the disease; most of the cases have been among individuals who were not immunized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say the best way to protect against the measles is with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing measles; one dose is about 93% effective. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;The CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; getting the first dose of the MMR vaccine at ages 12 to 15 months and the second dose at 4 to 6 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-to-do-if-youve-been-exposed-to-measles" class="subhead"&gt;What to do if you’ve been exposed to measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you were on the flight or at the terminal, nail salon or grocery store where the infected traveler visited, you should:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review your immunization and medical records to determine if you’re protected against measles. If you have not had measles in the past or have not yet obtained the measles vaccine, you are at risk of contracting the disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contact and notify your healthcare provider as soon as possible about a potential exposure if you are pregnant, have a weakened immune system or haven’t been immunized against the disease. Parents or guardians of infants who were possibly exposed should contact their pediatrician.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor yourself for symptoms, specifically a fever or unexpected rash from seven to 21 days after the potential exposure. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If symptoms develop, stay home and do not enter a healthcare facility before calling first to make them aware of your exposure and symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-long-it-takes-for-measles-symptoms-to-appear" class="subhead"&gt;How long it takes for measles symptoms to appear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms can develop from seven to 21 days after exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposed individuals who have been free of symptoms for more than 21 days are no longer at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-symptoms-of-measles" class="subhead"&gt;The symptoms of measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between seven and 14 days after exposure, your symptoms could include high fever, cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes, and rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From seven to 18 days after exposure, you may develop a rash on your face and upper neck. The rash can spread to your hands and feet over the course of three days. Health officials say the rash should last for five or six days before fading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infection can result in severe complications, including blindness, encephalitis (an infection causing brain swelling and, potentially, brain damage), severe diarrhea and related dehydration, ear infection, trouble breathing due to pneumonia and, in some cases, death, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s most common for complications to occur in children younger than 5 and adults over the age of 30, according to public health experts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 22:55:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPUGVIMXBRNlA1UDlPOGNYVGpYdDBmbFR6UngyTW9tOW9kbkF2OGxPWFdhWVFHVGNqaEh6NzVKX1lIaG5rTEZMaEVoTE1hMmNUdmlfdTR1WVhHLVpLV2ppdzByeFNSTnE3OVhkaFU0aDM4RVJNcUU4RzR1R3pWUklNNXpTekxWOFFBMC1kTWJBQ2RUdmJnQUtONDRhamh4Z0RBanpjekN0REFhdw</guid></item><item><title>West Texas measles outbreak spreads into Oklahoma - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxNbG0xbUZfNWYyZzZZVTB4eHpvUTY0UkdpSnVUXzBRM2xDMGhlcE5FOU56NGlZWWJ3dzBMX2xWeWRpdXZkY0FxdXZkbEp6c3hHQXpXZDFHbXYxeldLUnZ1aWRDVkR6VDVLSU9JV3RuVXlXVUlYWmpCLXZZQjFwYWtUTVhSSDI2QjczaVRlZDAxbTB1MTFJY2hncTJwUVRlOTTSAVZBVV95cUxNajc2ZEdMazFsbEVTb0RjYldYY3NYMjFpUHNFRHp1U09udE5XZUZ6R3JXTlBSajloYzRFWk9KOUd6enA0amZ4WHN6LVdNLU8zVkJlcjhuUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A third state is now part of the growing measles outbreak in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;On Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/news---events/newsroom/2025/first-cases-of-measles-in-oklahoma-reported.html" target="_blank"&gt;health officials in Oklahoma reported &lt;/a&gt;two “probable” cases in the state that appear to be linked to the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/west-texas-measles-outbreak-families-forego-conventional-medicine-vacc-rcna194795" target="_blank"&gt;ongoing outbreak in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/west-texas-measles-outbreak-families-forego-conventional-medicine-vacc-rcna194795" target="_blank"&gt;Texas and New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;According to the Oklahoma State Department of Health, the two people developed measles symptoms after exposure to cases associated with the Texas and New Mexico outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The individuals isolated immediately after they realized they had been exposed and stayed home throughout the period they were contagious, health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The two cases come as the outbreak in West Texas continues to grow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;On Tuesday, the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/a&gt; said that 223 measles cases had been confirmed in the state, up from 198 last week.

                                        &lt;p&gt;As the U.S. grapples with its first measles deaths in nearly a decade, health officials are urging Southern Californians to verify their vaccination status. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two unvaccinated people have died of measles in the past two weeks — including a &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309800/texas-measles-child-death-vaccination" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;child in rural Texas&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/07/nx-s1-5320352/measles-rfk-west-texas-outbreak" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;adult in a New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; — part of an outbreak that has infected more than 200 people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far,  there have been more than 220 measles cases reported in 12 U.S. states this year, compared with 285 throughout last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, L.A. County officials confirmed a case in a resident who recently had traveled through LAX. Passengers "assigned to specific seats" on China Airlines flight CAL8/CI8 arriving March 5 will be notified that they may have been exposed, according to a news release from Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. Local officials said they're working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, people at the following locations are cautioned of possible exposure:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wednesday, March 5, from 7 p.m. to 10:40 p.m. at Tom Bradley International Terminal at LAX.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Friday, March 7, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.: Cloud 9 Nail Salon, 5142 N. Lankershim Blvd., North Hollywood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monday, March 10, from 8:15 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.: Superior Grocery Store, 10683 Valley Blvd., El Monte.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is no active outbreak in California, there are now &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/measles.aspx" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;five confirmed measles cases&lt;/a&gt; reported in the state since January, according to the California Department of Public Health. That includes an infected &lt;a class="Link" href="https://laist.com/news/health/health-officials-warn-of-potential-measles-exposure-at-lax" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;infant who traveled through &lt;u&gt;LAX&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Feb. 19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all of 2024, there were 15 confirmed measles cases in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California has strict student &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/School/laws-california-law.aspx" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;vaccination laws&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and an average vaccination rate above 96% among kindergartners, but health officials warn that the region remains vulnerable because of international travel connections and pockets of under-vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mem-embed mem-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine provides the best protection against the disease. According to the CDC, 94% of reported cases have been in unvaccinated people or those with unknown vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have questions about measles and your risks in Southern California? We have answers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What’s causing the current spike in U.S. measles cases?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary cause is declining vaccination rates, experts say. Outbreaks are most likely to occur when the vaccination rate&lt;a class="Link" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html__;!!Iwwt!WOht7WM-b65xhcncf6ZyqjlBqbKTRaIxWB-NlqKDVH0JWldhrMa3FkN8ikXMnavEP7uPA4dFvFvxPawOGro$" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt; in a community dips below 95%&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rural west Texas county where the current outbreak is centered has an 82% MMR vaccination rate among kindergarteners, according to &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;state health records&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The reason we are seeing measles outbreaks is solely because some parents are not protecting their children from this highly contagious disease by immunizing them,” said John Swartzberg, clinical professor emeritus at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And in some cases, it’s because adults who have not been vaccinated are choosing to remain unvaccinated," Swartzberg continued. "There is no other explanation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many communities have fallen below the 95% threshold in recent years, health experts said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The primary reason for lower vaccination rates has been misinformation spreading through the internet and social media about potential harms of vaccination,” said Saahir Khan, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at USC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most prominent example is a scientific paper from the early 1990s that claimed to find a link between vaccination and autism — the study was later debunked and &lt;a class="Link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2831678/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;retracted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. As of last week, the CDC is planning a study to revisit that topic, &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-cdc-plans-study-into-vaccines-autism-sources-say-2025-03-07/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reuters reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How common is measles in the U.S.?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles was &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;officially eliminated from the United States in 2000&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which means there is no continuous transmission of the disease originating within the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New cases typically begin when travelers bring measles from abroad. Local outbreaks can occur when the disease reaches communities with pockets of unvaccinated people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2000, the number of people reported to have measles each year has ranged from a low of 37 people in 2004 to a high of 1,282 in 2019, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s the likelihood of a measles outbreak in Southern California?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An outbreak in the Los Angeles area is much less likely than in rural Texas because Southern California counties have generally maintained vaccination rates above 95% among school-aged children. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kern County, which borders L.A. County, had an MMR vaccination rate below 92% during the 2022-23 school year. That year, 12 Northern California counties also had vaccination rates below the threshold for herd immunity, according to the &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Immunization/2022-23KindergartenFirstGradeSummaryReport.pdf" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;California Department of Public Health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if there are pockets of people who have not been vaccinated within Southern California, an outbreak could occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are likely specific communities within Los Angeles that have lower vaccination rates and are at risk of outbreaks, as we have observed in other areas as with the Somali community in Minnesota or the Orthodox Jewish community in New York,” Khan said. “Unfortunately, vaccine misinformation has been targeted at these communities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community-level data on vaccination rates are available through annual school reporting audits conducted by the California Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data provided for the 2021-22 academic year shows more than 200 schools in Los Angeles County with less than 95% of students vaccinated against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can check out recent MMR vaccination rates at your child’s school or childcare facility (or schools in your ZIP code) in an &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/School/HowDoing.aspx" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;interactive map and database&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained by state health officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Has Southern California had a measles outbreak before?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Southern California has experienced several measles outbreaks in recent years. The most significant was a 2014-15 outbreak associated with Disneyland, which infected at least 131 California residents and spread to other states and countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, there were 73 confirmed measles cases in California, including 41 cases associated with six outbreaks. Five of those outbreaks were linked to patients who traveled internationally, according to state health officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Am I safe if I was vaccinated as a kid?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you received two doses of the measles vaccine as a child, you are considered protected for life and do not need a booster dose, according to the &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/questions.html" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re exposed to the virus, two doses of measles vaccine are about 97% effective, according to the CDC. One dose is about 93% effective. In the rare cases when vaccinated people do contract measles, they typically experience milder symptoms and are less contagious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you received only one dose as a child and were born after 1957, you are generally considered protected. But the CDC recommends that people in some groups ensure they’ve had two doses, including college students, healthcare workers and international travelers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, if you received the killed measles vaccine (an earlier formulation used between 1963-1967), you should ask your doctor about getting revaccinated with the current MMR vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are immunocompromised or pregnant should not get vaccinated, experts say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If someone is unsure, has not been vaccinated, or does not think they completed the full series and may be at higher risk they should talk with their doctor about getting a booster dose,” said Scott Roberts, assistant professor of Infectious Diseases at Yale School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Am I safe if I've had the measles before?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. The CDC considers you protected from measles if you have medical records confirming you had measles at some point in your life. Natural immunity after measles infection is lifelong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People born before 1957 are generally considered to have lifelong natural immunity because of widespread exposure to measles prior to the introduction of the vaccination program in 1963.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What if I don't have my vaccination records?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can’t find your vaccination records or other proof of measles immunity, the CDC recommends getting the MMR vaccine. There is no harm in getting another dose if you may already be immune, according to the health agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you could have a healthcare provider test your blood to determine whether you’re immune, but this is generally not recommended, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The antibody test is less helpful since it waxes and wanes, is variable by lab, and doesn’t measure all arms of the immune system,” said Roberts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Should my baby get an early 'bonus dose'?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early doses of the MMR vaccine (before 12 months) are typically only recommended for infants traveling to countries with high measles rates or living in areas with active measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With no active outbreak in Southern California currently, experts recommend sticking with the regular vaccination timeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early "bonus doses" don't count toward the two-dose series needed for school entry, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Children who receive an early dose still need their regular doses at 12 to 15 months and 4 to 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The vaccine works best if you get it for the first time between 12 and 15 months,” said Swartzberg. “If you get it earlier than 12 months, you’ll need to get two more doses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerned parents should talk to their child’s pediatrician, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How contagious is measles? How serious?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is extremely contagious. The virus is airborne and can live in the air or on surfaces for up to two hours. Each infected person can spread the disease to as many as 18 others who are not protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the vaccination program began in 1963, 3 million to 4 million people got measles each year in the United States, according to CDC estimates. Those cases resulted in 48,000 hospitalizations and between 400 and 500 deaths annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, for every 1,000 children who get measles, one or two will die from it, according to the CDC. About 1 in 5 unvaccinated Americans who get measles are hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms of measles?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms typically develop one to two weeks after exposure and occur in several stages:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Initial symptoms: High fever, cough, runny nose and conjunctivitis (red, watery eyes).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two to three days later: Small white spots may appear inside the mouth. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;After three to 5 days: A rash breaks out, beginning on the face and spreading to the neck, torso, arms, legs and feet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What should I do if I think I've been exposed to measles?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you believe you've been exposed, federal health officials recommend the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Call your doctor ASAP — don’t go straight to a medical facility without calling because you could put others at risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Check your immunity status (vaccination history, past infection).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay home and avoid public places for three weeks if you're unvaccinated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor for symptoms even if you're vaccinated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If symptoms develop, isolate yourself and call your doctor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mem-embed mem-end"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                                    &lt;/div&gt;

Vaccines clearly save lives, there’s no question about the science of that,” O’Leary said. Better understanding what parents want to learn from their pediatrician – or adults’ questions about their own shots -- is “really about improving care and not just necessarily about just the vaccination rates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“You can’t say you’re for vaccine safety and not study how people think about vaccines,” added Dr. Georges Benjamin of the American Public Health Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some of the canceled grants are a type that help fund the salaries of promising young researchers, whose careers may be threatened, O’Leary said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s the latest move against vaccines since Robert F.

Researchers found that compromised sleep quality leads to dysfunction in this crucial system, potentially increasing risks for memory decline and cognitive impairments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using advanced brain imaging in 72 older adults, the research highlighted that poor sleep negatively impacts connections within brain networks linked to memory performance. These insights emphasize the importance of maintaining good sleep hygiene to support brain health and healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep and Brain Health:&lt;/strong&gt; Poor sleep quality impairs the brain’s glymphatic system, crucial for clearing harmful proteins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Dysfunctional glymphatic activity due to poor sleep correlates with memory decline in older adults.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Networks:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep quality directly influences brain networks, affecting overall cognitive health and aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Hong Kong&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poor sleep among older adults is linked to disruptions in the brain’s “waste removal system”, according to researchers at The University of Hong Kong (HKU).  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study led by Professor Tatia M.C. Lee, Chair Professor of Psychological Science and Clinical Psychology and May Professor in Neuropsychology at HKU, offers valuable insight into how sleep quality impacts brain functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many studies have linked poor sleep with a decline in brain functioning. Professor Lee’s team focused on the glial-lymphatic (glymphatic) system, a fluid transport pathway that plays a vital role in clearing waste from the brain. The system’s efficiency is a critical determinant of brain health, particularly in ageing populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Lee and her team sought to understand the glymphatic-brain relationship in poor sleepers, which underlies memory decline. Dysfunction of the glymphatic system leads to the accumulation of toxic proteins, and this process has recently been implicated in several neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sleep quality, brain activities, and glyphamtic functioning are related. Understanding how sleep quality influences the glymphatic system and human brain networks offers valuable insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning age-related memory change,” Professor Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team studied 72 older adults using functional MRI scans and sleep recordings.  The findings indicate that poor sleep quality adversely affects normal brain function by deactivating the restorative glymphatic system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results clearly reveal the effect of sleep on the human brain’s network through the glymphatic system, which in turn affects memory performance in older adults,” said Professor Lee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Therefore, maintaining efficient glymphatic functioning seems crucial for promoting healthy aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study add important evidence that sleep quality affects cognitive health through the underlying neural relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Impaired memory is a common complaint among older adults with poor sleep quality,” Professor Lee noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results provide a novel perspective on the interplay between sleep, the glymphatic system and multimodal brain networks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was recently published in &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; in an article entitled “Effects of sleep on the glymphatic functioning and multimodal human brain network affecting memory in older adults”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this aging and sleep research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#88e6efe2e9f1e5ededc8e0e3fda6e0e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jaymee Ng&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://hku.hk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Jaymee Ng – University of Hong Kong&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41380-024-02778-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Effects of sleep on the glymphatic functioning and multimodal human brain network affecting memory in older adults&lt;/a&gt;” by Tatia M.C.

A proxy of the glymphatic functioning was obtained from the Diffusion Tensor Image Analysis along the Perivascular Space (DTI-ALPS) index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structural and functional brain networks were constructed based on MRI data, and coupling between the two networks (SC-FC coupling) was also calculated. Correlation analyses revealed that DTI-ALPS was negatively correlated with sleep quality measures [e.g., Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and apnea-hypopnea index].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding human brain networks, DTI-ALPS was associated with the strength of both functional connectivity (FC) and structural connectivity (SC) involving regions such as the middle temporal gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus, as well as with the SC-FC coupling of rich-club connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we found that DTI-ALPS positively mediated the association between sleep quality and rich-club SC-FC coupling. The rich-club SC-FC coupling further mediated the association between DTI-ALPS and memory function in good sleepers but not in poor sleepers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results suggest a disrupted glymphatic-brain relationship in poor sleepers, which underlies memory decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings add important evidence that sleep quality affects cognitive health through the underlying neural relationships and the interplay between the glymphatic system and multimodal brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 21:40:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5IN2JHNjd6dzlDRTV1V0RQVWZWUkVGUldGdTdTenVFRE5nUWJjRm92OWZVZ1FCMlRtMEJVeUotS1NNNEhMSXBpTVBfUUY0Q3BuOXkwM3Z3RjBocmZzam1tNHV2VHE4R1ZoN3A3SXlYbFlqVnM</guid></item><item><title>Man Whose Daughter Died From Measles Stands by Failure to Vaccinate Her: "The Vaccination Has Stuff We Don’t Trust" - Futurism</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE5aQmdLZ2M2dXNEUE4xeVlubWwzRnpjNmMxVWZhaHJuVHJMdmFzV193RDN1Qm5DdmdiNmp6XzZDUXlsNmlDTUdPdkJsNHg1c0ZMWWhjbHlTLVNJZVE5LVJiT3J0bXJwY3hEcjBwNDZxTXduQjZZZkQteQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section id="incArticle" class="post-content z-50 w-full p-3 space-y-4 bg-white border lg:-mt-6 md:p-4 md:border-gray-900 lg:ml-3 lg:w-2/3 font-b text-3"&gt;&lt;div class="space-y-4 lg:space-y-0"&gt;&lt;p class="block text-xs text-gray-500 uppercase lg:hidden font-c"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Image by Getty / Futurism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus far, there's only been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;one confirmed death&lt;/a&gt; in the measles outbreak spreading across North America — and the father of the unvaccinated child who died of the preventable disease is expressing no regrets about failing to get her the jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a startling &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/03/texas-measles-outbreak-death-family/681985/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the father of the six-year-old girl who became the first measles death in the United States &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/health/texas-measles-death/index.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;in 10 years&lt;/a&gt; discussed the beliefs that led up to her dying from an infectious disease that was essentially &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;eradicated at the turn of the last century&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identified only as Peter, the father at the heart of this tragedy is, like many others in Seminole, the small West Texas town at the center of the outbreak, a member of the traditional-minded Christian sect known as Mennonites. There's apparently nothing in that group's doctrine barring modern medicine, but like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8858841/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;many other conservative religious groups&lt;/a&gt;, many Mennonites are vaccine skeptics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The vaccination has stuff we don’t trust," Peter told &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;. "We don’t like the vaccinations, what they have these days. We heard too much, and we saw too much."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter insists that measles is a normal part of life — although for much of the country, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/well/measles-outbreaks-texas-rfk-jr.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;it is not&lt;/a&gt;, and hasn't been for decades in the wake of generations of successful vaccination campaigns against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everybody has it," the man told the magazine. "It’s not so new for us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those comments echo claims made by new Health and Human Services secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who said during president Donald Trump's first televised cabinet meeting at the end of February that it was "&lt;a href="https://x.com/DrMikeMendoza/status/1895219682673861020" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;not unusua&lt;/a&gt;l" for measles cases to spike from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have measles outbreaks every year," the political scion claimed — a claim that is only true now because anti-vaxxers like him and the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/03/nx-s1-5198506/rfk-jr-anti-vaccine-chd-lawsuits" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;group he used to lead&lt;/a&gt; have made people afraid to get them for fear of "injury" from these proven-safe inoculations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/anti-vaxxers-aghast-rfk-jr-vaccines" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;since changed his tune&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/05/rfk-measles-scrutiny-00214952" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;increased scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/the-dangers-of-rfk-jrs-measles-response" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;handle the outbreak&lt;/a&gt; taking place on his watch, the father of the six-year-old girl claimed by the disease has not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everybody has to die," he told &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic's &lt;/em&gt;Tom Bartlett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Peter appeared to become emotional after that admission, telling the columnist that it was "very hard" to deal with the "big hole" in his life resulting from the loss of his young child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's impossible to imagine what the man is going through — if only because it seems cruel to hold onto such regressive beliefs in the face of unnecessary death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on measles:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/anti-vaxxers-aghast-rfk-jr-vaccines" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anti-Vaxxers Aghast as RFK Jr. Admits That Vaccines Are Pretty Fantastic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 21:37:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE5aQmdLZ2M2dXNEUE4xeVlubWwzRnpjNmMxVWZhaHJuVHJMdmFzV193RDN1Qm5DdmdiNmp6XzZDUXlsNmlDTUdPdkJsNHg1c0ZMWWhjbHlTLVNJZVE5LVJiT3J0bXJwY3hEcjBwNDZxTXduQjZZZkQteQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
