So when he suddenly experienced left-sided weakness, numbness and difficulties with balance, walking, swallowing and speech, a family member rushed him to a nearby stroke clinic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“His blood pressure was sky high — about 254 over 150 millimeters — yet when you looked at him you’ve never know it, because he looked so well. That’s why we call hypertension the silent killer,” said Dr. Sunil Munshi, a consulting physician at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Munshi is the senior author of a case report about the man, a warehouse worker from Sherwood, Nottingham, whose name was withheld to protect his privacy. The paper was published Tuesday in the journal BMJ Case Reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Normal blood pressure for adults is less than 120 over 80 mm HG (millimeters of mercury). Blood pressure of 180 over 120 or higher is considered a medical crisis that requires immediate emergency care.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“His left side was numb, and scans showed he had a stroke in the deeper part of the brain, the thalamus, which explains the unsteadiness,” Munshi said. “He was admitted, and we treated him with five different medications until his blood pressure dropped to 170.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back at home again, the man’s blood pressure continued to climb, reaching 220 despite numerous drugs. Munshi and his team searched for answers for weeks, running extensive tests that turned up negative. Then one day the man told Munshi about his energy drink habit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Each day he consumed eight highly potent energy drinks to stay alert for his job — two cans at four different times during the day,” Munshi said. (The brand name was withheld from the study.) “Each of the drinks contained 160 milligrams of caffeine. Suddenly the diagnosis was clear.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some energy drinks can have up to 500 milligrams of caffeine, compared with 30 milligrams in tea and 90 milligrams in coffee, said study first author Dr. Martha Coyle, a resident doctor at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In the UK, guidelines suggest 400 milligrams of caffeine a day, between two and four cups,” Coyle said. “This gentleman was consuming 1,200 to 1,300 milligrams, three times the amount.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The US Food and Drug Administration also recommends no more than 400 milligrams a day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just weeks after stopping his consumption of the energy drink, the man’s blood pressure returned to normal. Today, years after the incident, he is healthy but still lives with the aftermath of his stroke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I obviously wasn’t aware of the dangers drinking energy drinks were causing to myself,” the man told his doctors. “(I) have been left with numbness (in my) left hand side hand and fingers, foot and toes even after 8 years.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Combinations of ingredients ‘cause havoc’&lt;br&gt; It’s not just high levels of caffeine. Today’s energy drinks also contain blood pressure boosting ingredients such as the amino acid taurine, Munshi said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Energy drinks that contain caffeine plus taurine produce significantly higher blood pressure than caffeine alone,” he said. “They also contain high levels of glucose — we know sugar damages the blood vessels in diabetes which leads to heart damage.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Energy drinks also typically contain ginseng, which impacts metabolism, and guarana, a plant thought to contain caffeine at twice the concentration of a coffee bean, according to the study. Milder stimulants such as theophylline, found in cocoa, and theobromine, found in tea, are often included as well, Coyle said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Such energy drinks can cause cardiac arrhythmias, damage the endothelium, the tissue that lines blood vessels, and aggregate blood platelets, Munshi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When platelets are aggregated, especially in the setting of high glucose, they can produce blood clots,” he said. “Young people are often willing to try energy drinks, especially in combination with other drugs such as cocaine or methylamphetamine, which have similar effects, and all of these drugs together can cause havoc.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Medical literature is full of examples of the harms of energy drinks, so this case, while startling, is not an isolated event, Munshi said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We have seen other patients who developed an irregular heartbeat, what we call atrial fibrillation,” he said.” Another patient developed an intracellular hemorrhage in the brain, while yet another patient had a stroke in the brain due to a blood clot.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Munshi believes doctors need to become more aware of the impact of energy drinks and ask about use during regular checkups, “especially when people come at a younger age with cardiovascular problems or strokes.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The nature of these drinks is changing. They have become more and more dangerous and more potent,” he added. “We propose increased regulation of energy drink sales and advertising campaigns, which are often targeted at younger ages.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>East Idaho News</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 00:10:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxOMDE5bjU5MUVZZHluenFJa08xaVlhYk1DVjlDZkVwT0hQLXRQeTVGSVdZek00ZVRlS2Y4NXZaV0V2RWRCb3BDMFVUMzR4TnJLb0Noa0pNX2pROHJsOGpLTE50NllKcTdQLUN3czktaWFyYVZZSWFsRGh3bnZWNDJlY1Z1aW82SnVUc3h5eElvZzVJeDdjTjRCbzdIRmVuTDRPWXdWNWoyT0FUVi1XMkxrWXZhUEhtTGMwOGFsY1N3bUVMOTFLeFcyZQ</guid></item><item><title>秃鹫尸体在俄亥俄州学校外腐烂后怀疑是禽流感-纽约时报</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/09/us/dead-vultures-bird-flu-ohio.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 23:55:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTFBZSDNCTGRCUUR5b0hpZHdjY3dCMXE1OWNpbkFfX0lfTW1tdG1MRVh4Y05qMEZrYkREb2hiV0FSNDNnZDhNSlphaHZNNFpVRllaWk1felpwbjRzUERuTk1DM1oxTjZQUXpMLW1KWlhLSE1TVVZrTm13czVB</guid></item><item><title>医生在FIT 50岁后发出与能量饮料有关的中风警告- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/doctors-issue-warning-after-fit-50-year-old-gets-stroke-tied-to-energy-drinks-2000697325</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl prose-science dark:prose-science"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If you’re a huge fan of energy drinks, you might want to listen up: a case study out today shows the perils of drinking too many of these caffeine-rich beverages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An otherwise healthy 50-year-old man in the UK developed a stroke likely caused by his habit of eight energy drinks per day, according to his doctors. Though the man ultimately recovered from the injury, he continues to have some lingering symptoms years later. The doctors say his case should offer an important lesson that these drinks aren’t necessarily harmless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Energy drinks are not currently widely seen as dangerous for cardiovascular risks—they have been discussed because of their effect on sleep and concentration, but the public has little awareness of the more hidden risks they pose,” study author Martha Doyle, a stroke doctor at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;No other identifiable cause&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the paper, &lt;a href="https://casereports.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bcr-2025-267441"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in BMJ Case Reports, the man visited the hospital with sudden numbness on his left side and general unsteadiness. He also had a remarkably high blood pressure reading of 254/150. For context, 120/80 is normal blood pressure, while 180/120 and above is recognized as a “hypertensive crisis.” Tests soon confirmed he had experienced a mild stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The man was hospitalized for three days. He was discharged with medications to lower his blood pressure and prevent further stroke. Over the next three months of follow-up visits, he appeared to make an excellent functional recovery, though he continued to have some numbness. More worryingly, he still had incredibly high blood pressure despite his medication, and he was even readmitted to the hospital as a result. He was then given more antihypertensives.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Finally, during a more detailed examination of his lifestyle, the man disclosed to doctors that he loved energy drinks. On average, he consumed eight drinks a day, each containing 160 milligrams of caffeine per serving. That amounts to about 1.3 grams of caffeine per day—over three times the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much#Footnote"&gt;maximum recommended dose&lt;/a&gt; (400 milligrams) for a typical adult.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The man was fit and healthy for his age, with no major stroke risk factors like a history of smoking or current alcohol drinking. The doctors’ many tests also failed to find any clear precipitating cause for his stroke, other than his very high blood pressure. So given all that, it’s almost certain the man’s energy drink habit played at least a part in spiking his blood pressure and subsequently triggering his stroke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We attribute this patient’s stroke to the effects of his energy drink consumption because through thorough investigations using multiple diagnostic methods we ruled out any other identifiable cause,” Coyle said.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the man agreed to quit energy drinks for good. Within a week, his blood pressure started to return to normal, and it remained healthy after he was weaned off the antihypertensives (yet more evidence that the drinks were to blame). Further follow-up visits showed that he made a complete recovery with no further strokes, and eight years later, his blood pressure continues to be normal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That said, he does still experience some residual numbness to this day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I obviously wasn’t aware of the dangers drinking energy drinks were causing to myself, (I) have been left with numbness (in my) left hand side hand and fingers, foot and toes even after eight years,” the man wrote in a patient perspective accompanying the report.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A needed warning&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The doctors say that there are several reasons why energy drinks can raise the risk of stroke and other cardiovascular problems, mostly tied to the high amounts of caffeine and sometimes sugar found in them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aside from causing a chronic rise in blood pressure, for instance, too much caffeine might cause a sudden narrowing of blood vessels in the brain or trigger an arrhythmia (an irregular heartbeat). Some ingredients popular in these drinks, such as taurine and ginseng, might also amplify the effects of caffeine, while others like &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK589113/"&gt;guarana&lt;/a&gt; can contain high amounts of undisclosed caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There have been some &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/21-year-old-man-nearly-dies-of-heart-failure-after-drin-1846699497"&gt;high-profile cases&lt;/a&gt; of cardiovascular disease tied to energy drinks. Between 2022 and 2023, for instance, at least two &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/panera-charged-lemonade-caffeine-second-death-lawsuit-1851080766"&gt;heart-related&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/23/business/panera-lawsuit-charged-lemonade-death/index.html"&gt;deaths&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. were linked to Panera Bread’s highly caffeinated “Charged Lemonade” energy drinks. By mid-2024, Panera had &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/panera-says-phasing-controversial-charged-lemonade-rcna151058"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; the item from its menu, and earlier this summer, the company &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/panera-settles-remaining-lawsuits-highly-caffeinated-charged-lemonade-rcna217767"&gt;settled&lt;/a&gt; the remaining lawsuits over these deaths and other reported injuries.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the report authors say that—much like their patient—the public still isn’t generally aware of the health risks these drinks can carry. And it’s possible that these risks could warrant increased regulation of these products or the advertising for them. Compared to something like alcohol, they note, energy drinks are frequently marketed to younger kids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Whether health authorities should be actively intervening we cannot definitively conclude from our reporting of just this case,” Coyle said. “However it would be beneficial to get this out there so if any similar cases exist they can be brought to attention. And also for the public, they have the right to know the risks of what they are consuming.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Speaking as someone who loves his morning and sometimes afternoon coffee, I’ll certainly be a bit more proactive in tracking my daily caffeine consumption from now on.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quarantine period for measles is 21 days from the exposure, which is the maximum incubation period before the tell-tale rash appears. Measles is highly infectious, with up to 90 percent of unvaccinated or otherwise vulnerable people contracting the virus upon exposure. People infected with measles are infectious from four days before the rash appears to four days after its onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak is occurring in the northern region of South Carolina, with many cases identified in Spartanburg County, which contains Inman, as well as Greenville County. Both counties have low vaccination rates. For the 2024–2025 school year, only 90 percent of Spartanburg students were vaccinated, while Greenville’s vaccination rate was 92.4 percent. Those numbers are well below the 95 percent target needed to halt community transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two counties’ low vaccination rates are coupled with high rates of religious exemptions. Spartanburg has the state’s highest rate, with 8.2 percent of students exempt from the school vaccination requirement based on religious beliefs. Neighboring Greenville has a religious vaccination exemption rate of 5.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 111 outbreak cases, 105 were unvaccinated, three were partially vaccinated, two had an unknown status, and one case was fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a national scale, vaccination rates have declined overall amid misinformation spread by anti-vaccine activists, including current Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. As such, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;measles cases&lt;/a&gt; are at a 33-year high, with nearly 2,000 cases this year and 46 outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was updated to correct the year the US eliminated measles. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;It’s normal for parents, or anyone, to have questions about vaccinations -- but what happens if your pediatrician urges a shot that’s &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-rfk-gold-standard-science-research-autism-6e4c6bc2534252ab1e7add0942043778"&gt;under attack by the Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s getting more likely: The nation’s leading doctors groups are in an unprecedented standoff with federal health officials who have attacked long-used, lifesaving vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The revolt by pediatricians, obstetricians, family physicians, infectious disease experts and internists came to a head when an advisory panel handpicked by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. urged an &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-babies-hepatitis-b-10f8db54beb38c5cd39a94f8a3657752"&gt;end to routine newborn vaccination&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; against hepatitis B, a virus that can cause liver failure or liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That vaccine saves lives, helped child infections plummet and has been given safely to tens of millions of children in the U.S. alone, say the American Academy of Pediatrics and other doctors groups that vowed Tuesday to keep recommending it.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;But that’s not the only difference. That Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices now is examining possible changes to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-rfk-kennedy-trump-covid-fda-novavax-b50f4d6fbcca378eb89b059bc8a91477"&gt;the entire childhood vaccination schedule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, questioning certain ingredients and how many doses youngsters receive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pushing back, the American Academy of Pediatrics has issued its own recommendations for youngsters. Other medical groups — plus some city and state public health departments that have banded together — also are issuing their own advice on certain vaccines, which largely mirrors pre-2025 federal guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Infobox" data-module data-gtm-region="This article is part of AP's Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We owe our patients a consistent message informed by evidence and lived experience, not messages biased by political imperative,” Dr. Ronald Nahass, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, told reporters Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;But Nahass acknowledged the inevitable consumer confusion, recounting a relative calling him last weekend for advice about hepatitis B vaccination for her new grandbaby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most Americans don’t have a Cousin Ronnie to call. They are left alone with fear and mistrust,” he said, urging parents to talk with their doctors about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;New guidelines without new data concern doctors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B isn’t the only vaccine challenge. Kennedy’s health department recently changed a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention webpage to contradict the longtime scientific conclusion that &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-autism-vaccines-7b1890f626dd5921fafd00fdd1e6425a"&gt;vaccines don’t cause autism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Federal agencies also moved to restrict COVID-19 vaccinations this fall, and are planning policy changes that could &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-prasad-memo-fda-rfk-jr-7cf543476ab3867b25a47463c9c5c144"&gt;restrict future flu and coronavirus shots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to vaccine advice, “for decades, ACIP was the gold standard,” said Dr. Jake Scott, an infectious disease physician and Stanford University researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel once routinely enlisted specialists in specific diseases for long deliberations of the latest science and safety data, resulting in recommendations typically adopted not only by the CDC but by the medical field at large, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week’s meeting of Kennedy’s panel, which includes vaccine skeptics, marked a radical departure. CDC specialists weren’t allowed to present data on hepatitis B, the childhood vaccine schedule or questions about vaccine ingredients. Few of the committee members have public health experience, and some expressed confusion about the panel’s proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;At one point, a doctor called in to say the panel was misrepresenting her study’s findings. And the panel’s chairman wondered why one dose of yellow fever vaccine protected him during a trip to Africa when U.S. children get three doses of hepatitis B vaccine. The hepatitis B vaccine is designed to protect children for life from a virus they can encounter anywhere, not just on a trip abroad. And other scientists noted it was carefully studied for years to prove the three-dose course offers decades of immunity — evidence that a single dose simply doesn’t have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If they’ve got new data, I’m all for it — let’s see it and have a conversation,” said Dr. Kelly Gebo, an infectious disease specialist and public health dean at George Washington University, who watched for that. “I did not see any new data,” so she’s not changing her vaccine advice.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Committee members argued that most babies’ risk of hepatitis B infection is very low and that earlier research on infant shot safety was inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Especially unusual was a presentation from a lawyer who voiced doubt about studies that proved benefits of multiple childhood vaccines and promoted discredited research pointing to harms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think at any point in the committee’s history, there was a 90-minute uninterrupted presentation by someone who wasn’t a physician, a scientist, or a public health expert on the topic — let alone someone who, who makes his living in vaccine litigation,” said Jason Schwartz, a vaccine policy expert at Yale University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By abandoning data and the consensus of front-line doctors, the ACIP is “actively burning down the credibility that made its recommendations so powerful,” added Stanford’s Scott. “Most parents will still follow their pediatricians, and AAP is holding the line here. But the mixed messages are precisely what erode confidence over time.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Parents already have a choice — they need solid guidance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump administration health officials say it’s important to restore choice to parents and to avoid mandates. That’s how the panel’s hepatitis B recommendation was framed — that parents who really want it could get their children vaccinated later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents already have a choice, said Dr. Aaron Milstone of the American Academy of Pediatrics. The government makes population-wide recommendations while families and their doctors tailor choices to each person’s health needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many doctors don’t — or can’t — do their own lengthy scientific review of vaccines and thus had relied on the ACIP and CDC information, Yale’s Schwartz noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They “rely on trusted expert voices to help navigate what is, even in the best of times, a complicated landscape regarding the evidence for vaccines and how best to use them,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a role that the pediatricians and other doctors groups, plus those multistate collaborations, aim to fill with their own guidelines — while acknowledging it will be a huge task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, “ask your questions, bring your concerns and let us talk about them,” said Dr. Sarah Nosal, of the American Academy of Family Physicians, urging anyone with vaccine questions to have an open conversation with their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Early reports show a fast-moving wave of infections that is already sending vulnerable individuals to hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, infection levels remain low in most regions, yet Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wastewater Surveillance System data shows flu activity rising in more than three dozen states as of early December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The CDC is warning that this flu season could be as bad as last year's flu season, which was the worst on record on hospitalizations and severe disease,” said Shereef Elnahal, president of Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University, during a recent press conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dawn Nolt, an infectious disease expert at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University raised concerns of how the strain this flu season could have on the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don't have that many beds,” Nolt said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“So one bed that's needed to treat a child with a respiratory illness is one less bed for the child who has to recover from surgery from appendicitis, who needs treatment for a bleeding disorder, or for the child who decides to take up skateboarding in the middle of winter and has a fracture."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="YouTubeEmbed_youTubeEmbed__ygKv1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oregon officials are watching the situation closely. Howard Chiou, medical director at the Oregon Health Authority, emphasized that while hospitalization and test positivity rates are currently typical for this point in the season, both indicators are trending upward. Given influenza’s rapid mutation rate, Chiou urged residents to get vaccinated rather than wait for clearer signs of severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You don’t wait for an accident to put the seat belt on,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine uptake, however, remains a concern. Roughly 1 million Oregonians—about 23% of the state—have received a flu shot so far, a figure approximately five percentage points lower than last year. Officials attribute the decline partly to the broader rise in vaccine skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising case numbers in several states hint at the strain’s disruptive potential. Massachusetts has observed a sharp acceleration in activity, with flu-related hospitalizations more than doubling in just two weeks. In Iowa, an “extremely high” rate of illness forced the Moulton-Udell school district to close for two days and cancel athletic events after nearly 30% of students and staff became sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationally, the CDC estimates that between 1.9 million and 3.3 million Americans have contracted the flu since October, with as many as 38,000 requiring hospitalization. Some hospital systems—including those in New Jersey and California’s Sonoma County—have reinstated mask requirements to protect high-risk patients during the respiratory virus season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health experts note that although this year’s influenza season appears to be starting earlier, an early onset does not necessarily predict a more severe peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 22:22:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1wFBVV95cUxNd1Mxdk5PTTIySld0ZW04UGlZSkhfMUVSSlJMaWl0Q0pkb2p5VHkyOEdCS2hWS3NIVW5aMXVUY3B6Tk4tMnMzbFU4V19PSnF0NUN1b1R2cEx2UjJUeUpSMzJWeVJ5VVB4YjdwMEVuQlBjRWUwTndiWEF1Z05jNlA5anVLWG1LZElnR2FNS1k5Vnp4TmNwMUZsOVpVaEp0VHFTd0FVVFNrY21EQkQtM2F5dWVDbUVSV1N1ZjBvZlBUOUNxZ1dKOXNjQ29IcWNOeUVvRXlPY2lxQQ</guid></item><item><title>大规模研究揭示痛风从何而来，而不是我们所想的那样- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-study-reveals-where-gout-comes-from-and-its-not-what-we-thought</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Gout is often blamed on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alcohol-can-trigger-serious-cardiac-effects-in-young-people"&gt;overindulgence in alcohol&lt;/a&gt; or unhealthy eating, but research suggests genetics plays a much bigger role in the painful arthritic condition than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, an international team of scientists looked at genetic data collected from 2.6 million people across 13 different cohorts of DNA data. That number included 120,295 people with "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-024-01921-5"&gt;prevalent gout&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparing the genetic codes of people with the condition to those of people without, the team found 377 specific &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"&gt;DNA regions&lt;/a&gt; where there were variations linked to gout – 149 of which hadn't been associated with the disease before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-revive-20-million-year-old-gene-to-help-fight-gout"&gt;Scientists Revive 20-Million-Year-Old Gene to Help Fight Gout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While lifestyle and environmental factors are certainly still in play, the findings suggest genetics is a major driver of gout risk – and the researchers think there may be more undiscovered genetic links still to be found, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gout is a chronic disease with a genetic basis and is not the fault of the sufferer – the myth that gout is caused by lifestyle or diet needs to be busted," &lt;a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/news/newsroom/study-busts-myths-about-cause-of-gout"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist Tony Merriman from the University of Otago in New Zealand, when the study was published last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gout/"&gt;Gout takes hold&lt;/a&gt; when there are high levels of uric acid in the blood, which then form sharp crystal needles in the joints. When the body's immune system starts to attack those crystals, it leads to significant pain and discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetics is important in every stage of that process, the researchers suggest. Particularly, it affects the likelihood of the body's immune system attacking the crystals, and in the way &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uric_acid"&gt;uric acid&lt;/a&gt; is transported around the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gout can come and go, but there are treatments available – and the authors behind the study think misconceptions can put people off getting those treatments. That's a real problem with cases of the condition &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrrheum.2015.91"&gt;rising and rising&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This widespread myth causes shame in people with gout, making some people more likely to suffer in silence and not go and see the doctor to get a preventive drug that lowers urate in the blood and will prevent their pain," &lt;a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/news/newsroom/study-busts-myths-about-cause-of-gout"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Merriman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of giving us a better understanding of the causes of gout, the study provides scientists with more options to explore when it comes to treatments, particularly in terms of managing the body's immune response to the buildup of uric acid. In fact, existing drugs could be repurposed for this job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_151682" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-151682" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Gichtfuss_im_Roentgenbild_002-642x693.png" alt="Huge Study Shows Where Gout Comes From, And It Isn't What We Thought" class="size-medium wp-image-151682" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Gichtfuss_im_Roentgenbild_002-642x693.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Gichtfuss_im_Roentgenbild_002-385x415.png 385w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Gichtfuss_im_Roentgenbild_002-768x828.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Gichtfuss_im_Roentgenbild_002-600x647.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Gichtfuss_im_Roentgenbild_002.png 1016w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-151682" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Gout on X-rays of a left foot in the metatarsal-phalangeal joint of the big toe.

Nevertheless, it gives us a much better sense of a health problem that's been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diseases-dickens-might-find-familiar-are-making-a-comeback-following-uk-s-austerity"&gt;afflicting people for centuries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope that, in time, better and more accessible treatments will become available with the new targets we identified," &lt;a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/news/newsroom/study-busts-myths-about-cause-of-gout"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Merriman. "Gout deserves more health-spend resources and greater prioritization in the health system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-024-01921-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Genetics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in November 2024. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;If you've noticed that one drink hits you harder than it used to, you're not alone. It's part of the natural aging process, and it may be your body doing you a favor.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AILSA CHANG, HOST: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the holidays, and for many people that means more parties and more occasions for alcoholic drinks. NPR's Maria Godoy reports on how alcohol can hit harder as we get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARIA GODOY, BYLINE: Once upon a time, a drink or two went down the hatch with no problems. Now it's a recipe for misery. Sound familiar? Dr. Monica Christmas of the University of Chicago Medicine says it's a common lament as people enter middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MONICA CHRISTMAS: You are not alone. I am in that age range, too, and absolutely it needs to be spread out or it's all going to go straight to my head and I will need to sleep half the day away the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: There are physiological explanations for why our ability to tolerate alcohol wanes with age. For one thing, the liver enzymes that break down alcohol become less efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHRISTMAS: And so that means that our bodies metabolize alcohol a little bit differently. And we also lose more muscle as we get older, and that muscle is replaced by fatty tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: That's important because muscle stores water, which dilutes alcohol in our blood. Having less muscle mass means alcohol will hang around in our bodies longer, says Johannes Thrul. He's an alcohol and substance abuse researcher at Johns Hopkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JOHANNES THRUL: And so what this means is that the same drink that previously maybe felt just fine now leads to a higher blood alcohol level. You feel the effects for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: These changes happen to both men and women as they enter middle age. But for women in perimenopause, Christmas says alcohol can exacerbate the symptoms that come with hormonal fluctuations, like mood swings and irritability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHRISTMAS: Alcohol is - already is known to be a depressant. It can also increase baseline anxiety symptoms. Alcohol can disrupt sleep too. If you're already experiencing all of those symptoms, it's just that much more compounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: While worse hangovers might not sound like a good thing, think of it as your body nudging you in the right direction. Geriatrician Ken Koncilja with the Cleveland Clinic says the risks of drinking alcohol increase with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KEN KONCILJA: Things like liver disease, increased risk of diabetes, high blood pressure very much can be exacerbated. Memory problems - alcohol use can cause dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: It can also interfere with many medications and lead to balance problems and more falls. And drinking alcohol raises the risk of several types of cancer. Koncilja says he makes it a point to discuss the benefits of cutting back with his patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KONCILJA: And these conversations about alcohol use, being proactive with people in their 50s and 60s has huge impact for their health and well-being when they're in their 80s and 90s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: Johannes Thrul of Johns Hopkins says while the healthiest option is to not drink at all, even small changes to cut back can reap health benefits. During holiday parties, he says, try alternating alcoholic drinks with mocktails, and drink plenty of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THRUL: Why don't you just give it a try and see how it feels? 'Cause you might be surprised how good it actually is when you sleep better, you have less anxiety the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: He says your body will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maria Godoy, NPR News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Nearly 800 New Yorkers were hospitalized with the flu that week, up 93% from the week before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="1isr3"&gt;State officials are urging New Yorkers to get vaccinated against the flu, as well as against COVID and RSV, as they prepare to gather with friends and family for the winter holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="3qoq5"&gt;"We expect a more severe flu season due to circulating strains of the virus compared to last year,” state Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said in a statement on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="c299l"&gt;"Gathering with loved ones is what this season is all about,” McDonald continued. “Vaccines ensure we have the best protection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="fjk8q"&gt;About 3.4 million New Yorkers had gotten their flu shots for the season as of mid-November, a slight drop from the same period last year, when 3.5 million flu shots had been given out statewide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="48l34"&gt;State data shows COVID vaccination has also dropped 30% so far this season compared with the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="evjph"&gt;A period of confusion over access to the shots ensued this fall amid a shift in federal guidance. Gov.

    &lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Avoid 'brain' supplements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From fish oils to vitamins and softgels claiming to boost memory, every pharmacy seems to be selling the next miracle pill to boost your brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Landsverk cast doubt on these claims, saying that, realistically, no pill could replace someone doing the basics of eating well and exercising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told Daily Mail: 'To prevent dementia, you do need to look at changing your habits, as opposed to taking a pill and still having your steak and fries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;On the list was brain supplements, which they said were not likely to boost cognitive health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'None of these supplements have been proven to be helpful. None of them have proven efficacy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because they are sold as supplements, they do not go through safety or efficacy testing and do not need to be proven effective in studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Landsverk also raised concerns over potential contaminants in neurological-related supplements that could harm someone's brain rather than boost its health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/Home/PressRelease/3822"&gt;2020 study by the American Academy of Neurology&lt;/a&gt; that tested 10 supplements bearing names such as 'nootropics', 'smart drugs' and 'cognitive enhancers' detected prescription drugs in them that were not approved for use in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drugs included two analogs of piracetam, a prescription drug used to improve brain function approved in Europe that has not been approved in the US because of little evidence it is effective, and phenibut, a nervous system depressant that has been linked to addiction, reduced consciousness and breathing problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Failing to wear glasses or use hearing aides when needed was also a factor, the researchers said (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Don't go without your glasses or hearing aids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 75 percent of Americans need some form of vision correction, while around 15 percent, mostly older adults, need a hearing aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But surveys suggest that many who need these inventions avoid them, either because of concerns over their appearance, habit or a refusal to admit either has deteriorated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Langa warned, however, that not using these could raise the risk of someone suffering from dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told Daily Mail: 'There is increasing evidence around making sure things like hearing troubles or vision problems are addressed to help prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There are two main theories why these may be a risk; One is that, as people have more trouble with hearing and vision, they kind of stop interacting with the world a bit more and, by doing that, they are more socially isolated, and we know that social isolation is a risk factor for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The other potential pathway would be the idea that, because the brain is receiving less input due to a vision or hearing impediment, the brain is stimulated less and this somehow injures or harms the brain.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts warn that less stimulation of the brain may weaken connections between neurons in the organ, raising the risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/fullarticle/2813302#:~:text=Results%20The%20study%20population%20comprised,more%20high%2Dquality%20longitudinal%20studies."&gt; 2024 study&lt;/a&gt; involving 573,000 people, including 40,000 with hearing loss, found that those who had hearing loss but were not using hearing aids had a 20 percent higher risk of dementia compared to those without the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among those who had hearing loss but were using the devices, they had a six percent higher risk of dementia compared to those without the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;There was also a warning over living in cities, with experts saying the pollution, noise and lack of green spaces could affect someone's health (Above is Bangkok, Thailand)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Choose your home wisely&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many are attracted to the big city for job opportunities, higher salaries and the chance to mingle with a wide variety of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Langa warned that these 'concrete jungles', where about 80 percent of the US population live, could raise someone's risk of suffering from dementia in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Elizabeth Landsverk, shown above, also warned over the risk factors that could raise someone's risk of suffering from dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told Daily Mail: 'There is increasing evidence that pollution exposure in life may increase the risk for cognitive decline and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Additionally, the amount of traffic, noise, your ability to get outside into say, parks or green space where you are able to do physical activity and interact with friends, all of those seem to have an important impact on your risk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have previously suggested that pollution may raise the risk of dementia because it leads people to breathe in more fine particles that can enter the circulatory system and be carried to the brain, where they damage brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Being in a neighborhood with few green spaces or meeting points may also pose a risk, researchers suggest, because someone may have fewer opportunities to socialize with friends or a community or stimulate their brain through vigorous physical activity, which can also raise their risk of suffering from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts also recommended that people should get the shingles vaccine, which studies have suggested may be able to reduce someone's risk of suffering from dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Don't skip the shingles vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The shingles vaccine is recommended for all adults aged 50 years or older, but estimates suggest less than 40 percent get the shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Shown above is Dr Ken Langa, an internist and dementia researcher at the University of Michigan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vaccine protects against the chickenpox virus, which remains dormant in the body for decades after an infection and can be reactivated, often in later life when the immune system is weaker. About 1 million Americans get shingles every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Langa told Daily Mail that the vaccine could also have a second, unexpected, use; preventing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'The shingles vaccine prevents or decreases the risk that the [chickenpox] virus gets reactivated and, therefore, decreases the amount of inflammation that your body is exposed to and has to fight off the virus again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Certainly, one theory is that because the vaccine will decrease the likelihood of having a shingles episode, it decreases the likelihood of the body having high inflammation, and the nerves in the brain sort of benefit.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/03/shingles-vaccination-dementia.html"&gt;study published in July&lt;/a&gt; last year found that, out of 100,000 adults tracked, those who received the shingles vaccine were 20 percent less likely to develop dementia over the next seven years than those who did not receive the shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Shown above is a stock image of a tick biting a human. In some cases, Lyme disease may also raise someone's risk of being diagnosed with dementia (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Watch out for tick bites&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in 10 Americans are bitten by a tick every year, and nearly half a million people are diagnosed with Lyme disease annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease is treated with antibiotics, but can cause brain fog, headaches, memory issues and drooping on one side of the face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But now, amid anecdotal cases, experts are looking into whether the tick-borne disease may also be a risk factor for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jessica Zwerling, a neurologist at the Montefiore Hudson Balley Center of Excellence for Alzheimer's Disease in New York City, said: 'Lyme disease can raise the risk of arthritis, and a different type of brain disease when it comes to dementia.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Langa said: 'It would not be top of my list, maybe five or six paragraphs down, but there is evidence to suggest that this could raise the risk of dementia.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts said that Lyme disease may raise the risk of dementia by causing inflammation in the body, which could disrupt nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Alzheimer's Society says online that there is now increasing evidence to suggest a potential link between dementia and Lyme disease, but that it is not yet enough to say that it can cause the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It adds: 'In rare cases Lyme disease can also affect the brain, causing dementia-like symptoms. With early treatment, this is reversible.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Society cited a 2023 case study of a man who developed a form of dementia years after suffering from Lyme disease, although said it was not clear whether the two were connected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 20:56:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxNdXk2OHJzTkluMXRoUjJrWGpDd3FyLW5fOHpObW0xbE9iRzV6dHlmS0xqYWkyaDkyZTNsVmhqNXBYbXJKVUxlOUxIeU5uNnM0dklFdzRKb0VDcm9KUm5XT3dERUxPRU5aa3puQzktQ1FwZndmbm9QZnJPa19oSktSWG1zZ1U1WGZuTzU4amlB0gGTAUFVX3lxTFBNMURZUjdsRnUxamNzVTU0RHZFRnRzTjlKQ0wwZ0Z2QkVqck1nU21RR2ttelpnZFFaQzloMzNpNVFIaEhaNHVRNk1VYzI2emhuM0JqeG1OY3FrQjlvYVhURmRUMTZEMFJyb3h6OFlBbC11MU5HY1F0aDc4MmNueXNDLUVsRE80Y000LUlOUXRYY2pTdw</guid></item><item><title>大蒜漱口水？科学说是- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/garlic-mouth-wash-the-science-says-yes-2000697393</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl prose-science dark:prose-science"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It turns out that in addition to keeping vampires away, garlic might also have decent mouthwashing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A team of researchers has conducted a review of past studies regarding garlic extract’s potential as an antimicrobial mouthwash compared to chlorhexidine, the current standard. While further research is necessary, they concluded that it can indeed serve as a viable alternative, particularly in higher concentrations. The side effects described by the researchers, however, failed to address what a garlic-based mouthwash would mean for one’s romantic life. Maybe that’ll be for the next review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A natural alternative?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial mouthwashes are used to treat bacterial, fungal, and viral oral diseases impacting the mouth’s hard or soft tissues. Patients can use them for gingivitis, cavities, periodontal diseases, and even halitosis—a.k.a. bad breath.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Chlorhexidine is widely used as a gold standard mouthwash but is associated with side effects and concerns over antimicrobial resistance. Garlic (&lt;em&gt;Allium sativum&lt;/em&gt;), known for natural antimicrobial properties, has emerged as a potential alternative, though clinical evidence remains limited,” the researchers, all from the University of Sharjah’s College of Dental Medicine, wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2210803325000648?via%3Dihub"&gt;review article&lt;/a&gt; published this fall in the Journal of Herbal Medicine. “This systematic review compares the antimicrobial efficacy of garlic extract with chlorhexidine in clinical practice, assessing its viability as a herbal substitute,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;From an initial pool of over 400 articles, the team narrowed the selection down to five, and their review revealed that higher concentrations of garlic extract mouthwash exhibited antimicrobial capabilities comparable to chlorhexidine. Chlorhexidine is a common synthetic antimicrobial agent effective in different medical and dental contexts. Garlic, the vegetable virtually everyone knows and loves, is frequently used as an herb and spice and is one of the strongest naturally occurring antibacterial and antifungal crops. While garlic extract can cause side effects, they’re usually less intense than side effects linked to synthetic chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, “the effectiveness varied based on mouthwash concentration and duration of application, contributing to differences in outcomes,” the researchers wrote. “Some studies favored chlorhexidine for maintaining higher plaque/salivary pH, while others reported garlic extract to be more effective at certain concentrations. However, garlic mouthwash may cause greater discomfort.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Side effects&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The papers reported side effects such as a burning sensation and unpleasant odor. Unsurprisingly, this might impact people’s inclination to drop chlorhexidine for a vampire-resistant alternative. Garlic extracts, however, are more easily accessible than chlorhexidine and similar synthetic agents, which usually necessitate a prescription. They are commonly accessible in a number of over-the-counter health products. What’s more, mouthwash with garlic extract seems to have more lasting residual effects than chlorhexidine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall, “garlic extract mouthwash demonstrated clinical antimicrobial effectiveness, with significant reductions in bacterial counts from baseline,” the researchers explained. Their review indicates that, in certain situations, garlic extract mouthwash could be a possible alternative to antiseptics and disinfectants such as chlorhexidine, which remains the gold standard mouthwash.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“These studies have contributed to understanding the antimicrobial role of garlic extract in comparison to synthetic agents like chlorhexidine,” they continued. However, “further clinical studies with larger samples and longer follow-up are needed to confirm effectiveness and improve clinical applicability.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Someone also needs to check in on the potential for garlic breath.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="ad76ee2c-13c2-4bea-8d5a-ce6c6b0bb414"&gt;Scientists think a very common childhood infection may be linked to bladder cancer — and now, they're figuring out the chain reaction that connects the two diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's known that people who get kidney transplants are &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2173578621000755?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2173578621000755?via%3Dihub" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;three times more likely&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to develop bladder cancer than the general population. Researchers have hypothesized that because transplant patients are immunosuppressed, dormant viruses lurking in the body are given the opportunity to reactivate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="ad76ee2c-13c2-4bea-8d5a-ce6c6b0bb414-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;These sleeping pathogens include &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ukkidney.org/rare-renal/patient-information-0/bk-nephropathy" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ukkidney.org/rare-renal/patient-information-0/bk-nephropathy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;BK virus (BKV)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, also called human polyomavirus type I, a common cold virus that 95% of people pick up as children.

Normally, these enzymes help form the body's first-line defense against viruses and other pathogens. "They have these signatures from APOBECs, and we know APOBECs are part of the antiviral host defense," Baker explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker and his team took healthy human bladder cells and infected them with the BK virus in lab dishes. They found that the cells not only exhibited mutations similar to those seen in bladder cancer but also boosted the activity of APOBEC3, an enzyme that damages viral genomes in response to infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="f0e5849b-46a2-484e-a3b1-a4cef781e9a4"&gt;When the scientists turned off APOBEC3 and then infected the cells with the BK virus, the DNA damage didn't occur. This finding suggests that the enzyme made by the host cell was causing the damage, not the virus itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the researchers found increased APOBEC3 expression and cancer-like genetic mutations in nearby "bystander" cells that hadn't been infected with the virus. So, a cell doesn't have to contain the actual virus to accumulate genetic mutations caused by an infection elsewhere in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That was a surprise," Baker said. "But the reason it makes perfect sense is that … bladder cancers don't have viruses in them." This finding starts to unravel the connection between early-life viral infections and cancers diagnosed decades later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-07a975ec-4651-4d1e-9745-0e91a83d8579" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-starting-point-3"&gt;A starting point&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="a50d178e-2a61-41a1-a186-70795c51de77"&gt;Although these initial data are impactful, Moore said he would like to see whether patients with bladder cancer are infected more often with the BK virus than people without the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is intriguing," he said, "but only a starting point and work needs to be done to show its actual importance to human cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a person contracts the BK virus in childhood, they generally experience common cold symptoms before recovering. The virus then stays inactive, or &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0882401016300389?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0882401016300389?via%3Dihub" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dormant&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in the kidney, bladder and tubes between the two organs.

                                        Most people on the planet aren't getting enough omega-3, according to an analysis out of the UK that found 76% of the global population is falling short of the recommended daily intake. The review, conducted by researchers at the University of East Anglia, the University of Southampton, and health retailer Holland &amp;amp; Barrett, is the first to compile national and international omega-3 guidelines for generally healthy people across all life stages, per &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251208052527.htm"&gt;ScienceDaily&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers say the health benefits of omega-3 fatty acids like EPA and DHA are well-established, ranging from supporting infant development and reducing the risk of preterm birth to improving heart health and lowering the risk of depression and cognitive decline later in life.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

                                        The research published in the &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/nutrition-research-reviews/article/an-overview-of-national-and-international-long-chain-omega3-polyunsaturated-fatty-acid-intake-recommendations-for-healthy-populations/2B7F6FD161EE90A7472B2B20909C4926"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrition Research Reviews&lt;/em&gt; journal&lt;/a&gt; points to a mismatch between public health guidance and what people actually consume. They also note that the recommendations themselves are inconsistent and confusing the world over. "To close that gap, we need easier, sustainable ways to get these important nutrients—like foods enriched with omega-3s or supplements," says the University of East Anglia's Anne Marie Minihane.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

                                        The most commonly recommended intake for adults is 250mg per day of combined EPA and DHA, with pregnant women advised to get an extra 100mg to 200mg of DHA. The recommended levels can be met by eating more oily fish or taking supplements, though the researchers acknowledge that dietary preferences and sustainability concerns can get in the way. Per &lt;a href="https://nutraceuticalbusinessreview.com/study-links-higher-omega-3-levels-lower-suicidal-thoughts"&gt;Nutraceutical Business Review&lt;/a&gt;, a different &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12944-025-02689-1"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; found that higher omega-3 levels have been tied to a reduced risk of suicidal ideation.

Five deaths have also been reported. Both Nassau and Lee County have recorded no fatalities this year. Lee has registered four cases, while Nassau has only registered one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nationwide, at least 72 cases have been recorded across 12 states in 2025, mostly in the South, although one infection was also reported as far north as &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/massachusetts/index.html" id="mol-a66f7670-d509-11f0-bb8f-917bb609b4fd"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Louisiana has seen a major uptick in Vibrio, with 26 infections and five deaths reported so far this year, well above the seven to 10 infections recorded annually. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vibrio are bacteria that naturally live in coastal waters, but are found in higher numbers from May to October when water temperatures rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Genevieve Gallagher, 49, caught Vibrio vulnificus after swimming at a beach off Florida's coast.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Warning signs of an infection include skin redness or a rash that quickly becomes swollen or painful, fluid-filled blisters, fever, pain and an altered mental state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In severe cases, patients may need to have limbs amputated or the bacteria can enter the blood and cause the life-threatening condition sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in five people infected with the bacteria die from the disease, the CDC says, and about 80 percent are hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with weakened immune systems, older adults or those eating raw seafood are most at risk for the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Florida revealed the two new cases in an update to its statewide data on December 5, but gave no further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The state health department warns online: 'Vibrio vulnificus is a naturally occurring bacteria in warm, brackish water. Water and wounds do not mix. Do not enter the water if you have fresh cuts and scrapes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Florida's case and fatality tally from Vibrio is below last year's, when a total of 82 infections and 19 deaths were recorded.

						The "Shaking Palsy."Those are the words Dr. James Parkinson used in an essay more than 200 years ago to group together symptoms and describe a mysterious infirmity afflicting six individuals in London. The British physician was the first to identify and document the condition now known as Parkinson's disease, a progressive movement disorder. Its hallmark is damage to the dopamine-producing neurons in the brain that can lead to muscle stiffness, slowness, balance issues and a host of other problems.Dopamine is a crucial neurotransmitter involved in our brain's reward system. The chemical plays a central role in motivation, as well as executive function (which includes attention, decision-making, multitasking and planning), movement and emotional regulation.By 2021, public health researchers  reported there were almost 12 million cases worldwide. And the number of people living with Parkinson's is projected to top 25 million by 2050. The disease not only substantially burdens the individual, but also takes a toll on their family, their community and society as a whole."We're now growing as a neurodegenerative disease faster than Alzheimer's disease — that should grab everybody's attention," neurologist Dr. Michael Okun told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast, Chasing Life.Parkinson's disease is so much more than just a shaking palsy, as scientists have come to learn since 1817, but there is still quite a way to go in identifying its root causes, understanding more fully the progression of the disease, and even developing a foolproof diagnostic test."It becomes obvious, just absolutely obvious, when you see the folks with disease that this isn't just a disease of dopamine; it isn't just a disease of the brain. We see it in the gut. We see it in the skin. We see it in multiple organs," said Okun, who cofounded and codirects the Norman Fixel Institute for Neurological Diseases at the University of Florida, in Gainesville, and is the medical director and medical adviser for the Parkinson's Foundation. "So, it is super important that we ask the why: Why does it start? Why does it progress? Why does it spread?"Genetics plays a key role in between 10% and 15% of cases. For many others, Okun said, the underlying cause of the disease might be more mundane and insidious: environmental toxins — via the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat and the chemicals with which we regularly come in contact."We have such an opportunity now to understand, hey, we don't have to live in a world where we think it's inevitable to get Parkinson's," Okun said. His latest book on the disease, "The Parkinson's Plan: A New Path to Prevention and Treatment," cowritten with Dr. Ray Dorsey, in part explores the associations between the disease and a host of chemicals that quietly assail our bodies.You can listen to the full episode here.What can you do to reduce your chances of getting Parkinson's? Okun has a list of 25 tips in his book, and these are his five favorites.Drink clean waterInvest in a carbon water filter for your kitchen sink, Okun said via email."A simple carbon filter can reduce the invisible toxicants that sneak into drinking water and may stress vulnerable brain systems," he said. "Clean water lowers the everyday chemical load your gut and brain must handle."These filters can reduce exposure to pesticides and chemicals like trichlorethylene, or TCE, a common chemical used to dry-clean clothes, decaffeinate coffee and degrease metal, as well as other impurities. (In December 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency announced an almost complete ban of TCE, but lawsuits have so far stayed the rule's effective start date under certain circumstances.)Breathe clean airUse air purifiers both at home and work."Removing fine particulate matter from indoor air protects the nose-to-brain pathway that may seed Parkinson's," Okun said. "Cleaner air means fewer triggers entering through the brain's front door."Make sure to use an air purifier with a carbon filter designed to remove volatile organic chemicals, or VOCs, such as TCE. Volatile organic compounds are gases that can be emitted from solid or liquid products, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. These chemicals can cause problems such as eye, nose and throat irritation and damage to the liver, kidney and central nervous system, the federal agency said.Eat clean foodTake the time to wash your fruits and vegetables, even if they are organic."Rinsing and scrubbing your produce … helps remove pesticide residues that can quietly injure mitochondria over time," Okun noted. "This simple daily habit lowers the exposure load your brain and nervous system must manage."And just as you would when washing your hands, you should rinse them for more than 20 seconds, Okun added.Keep your body movingExercise every day. Regular movement is thought to prevent or delay the onset of Parkinson's disease — and it is also crucial for people who already live with the disorder."Exercise every day, using four 20-minute walks (around 7,000 steps), or an equivalent routine that keeps you moving throughout the day," Okun said via email. "Movement wakes up natural dopamine circuits, improves mobility, and may possibly slow symptom progression."For those who feel unsteady on their feet, Okun noted that a recumbent stationary bike is a safe and effective alternative.Get enough sleepPrioritize  consistent, high-quality sleep to give your brain a chance to recover every night."Deep sleep activates the brain's built-in cleaning system, flushing toxins and helping symptoms improve the following day," Okun said. "Protecting sleep is protecting brain health, especially when living with or aiming to prevent Parkinson's."Then, when you get up in the morning, enjoy a cup of caffeinated coffee or tea. Research has consistently associated caffeine consumption with a lower risk of Parkinson's Disease; it is believed to protect the dopamine-producing nerve cells from damage caused by environmental toxins.

&lt;p id="899d75a7-18a1-47b0-b795-4d66b09cb0f2"&gt;Graying hair could be a sign that the body is effectively protecting itself from cancer, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer-causing triggers, such as&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/sun-and-uv/uv-radiation.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/sun-and-uv/uv-radiation.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt; &lt;u&gt;ultraviolet (UV) light&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or certain chemicals, activate a natural defensive pathway that leads to premature graying but also reduces the incidence of cancer, the research found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="899d75a7-18a1-47b0-b795-4d66b09cb0f2-2"&gt;The researchers behind the study tracked the fate of the stem cells responsible for producing the pigment that gives hair its color.

A tiny pocket within the follicle contains reserves of melanocyte stem cells — precursors to the cells that produce the melanin pigment that gives hair its color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every hair cycle, these melanocyte stem cells will divide and produce some mature, differentiated cells," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://profiles.sgul.ac.uk/dot-bennett" target="_blank" data-url="https://profiles.sgul.ac.uk/dot-bennett" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dot Bennett&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a cell biologist at City St George's, University of London who was not involved in the study. "These migrate down to the bottom of the hair follicle and start making pigment to feed into the hair."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graying occurs when these cells can no longer produce sufficient pigment to thoroughly color each strand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ksVhsp8PbtHfP6RDqKuDoS" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ksVhsp8PbtHfP6RDqKuDoS slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a sort of exhaustion called cell senescence," Bennett explained. "It's a limit to the total number of divisions that a cell can go through, and it seems to be an anti-cancer mechanism to prevent random genetic errors acquired over time propagating uncontrollably."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the melanocyte stem cells reach this "stemness checkpoint," they cease to divide, meaning the follicle no longer has a source of pigment to color the hair. Ordinarily, this occurs with old age as the stem cells naturally reach this limit. However,&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/aging-regeneration/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/aging-regeneration/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Emi Nishimura&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of stem cell age-related medicine, and colleagues at the University of Tokyo were interested in how this same mechanism operates in response to DNA damage — a key trigger for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/cancer" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/cancer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cancer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mouse studies, the team used a combination of techniques to track the progress of individual melanocyte stem cells through the hair cycle after exposing them to different harmful environmental conditions, including &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/ionizing-radiation" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/ionizing-radiation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ionizing radiation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and carcinogenic compounds. Intriguingly, they found that the type of damage influenced how the cell reacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ionizing radiation caused the stem cells to differentiate and mature, and ultimately activated the biochemical pathway responsible for cell senescence. As a result, the melanocyte stem cell reserves were rapidly depleted over the hair cycle, thus halting the production of further mature pigment cells and leading to gray hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, by essentially switching off cell division, this senescence pathway prevented the mutated DNA from passing into a new generation of cells, thus lowering the likelihood of those cells forming cancerous tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposure to chemical carcinogens — such as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/GB/en/product/sigma/d3254" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/GB/en/product/sigma/d3254" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a tumour initiator widely used in cancer research — appeared to bypass this protective mechanism. Instead of switching on senescence, it toggled on a competing cellular pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="53a902ed-cd55-4ae4-ac21-91f9620410a6"&gt;This alternative chemical sequence blocked cell senescence in the team's mouse studies, enabling the hair follicles to retain their stem cell reserves and the ability to produce pigment, even after DNA damage. That meant that the hair retained its color, but in the long term, the unchecked replication of damaged DNA led to tumor formation and cancer, the team said in a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/imsut/en/about/press/page_00079.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/imsut/en/about/press/page_00079.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings reveal that the same stem cell population can meet opposite fates depending on the type of stress they're exposed to, lead study author Nishimura said in the statement. "It reframes hair graying and melanoma [skin cancer] not as unrelated events, but as divergent outcomes of stem cell stress responses," Nishimura added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step will be to translate this understanding into human hair follicles, to see whether these observations in mice carry over to people, Bennett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="e1897105-2585-44b3-a7d1-e6eebd501436"&gt;

And if you’re sick, a steaming cup of whiskey, honey, lemon, and water can sound like a lot more fun than crackers and broth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But what about the alcohol? Here’s what experts say about hot toddies and colds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="can-i-have-a-hot-toddy-when-im-sick" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I have a hot toddy when I’m sick?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Overall, it’s not a great idea, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Patients sometimes bring up hot toddies as a cold remedy, says Jesse Bracamonte, a family medicine physician at Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona. Indeed, some of the ingredients can be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Hot fluids, honey, and a little bit of lemon can be very therapeutic in combating a respiratory infection,” says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But there’s an important exception: “I would never recommend having alcohol with any illness,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="59efc4b2-afa6-43ab-99b5-d2f50c2d0b01" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":7,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Is love addiction real – and what does it look like?","elementId":"59efc4b2-afa6-43ab-99b5-d2f50c2d0b01","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/dec/02/love-addiction-explained"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While drinking can cause a relaxing effect, consuming alcohol while sick can also overly sedate you, particularly if you’re taking cold and cough medications like Benadryl, Bracamonte says. Combining alcohol with medications that have sedative effects can &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/health-professionals-communities/core-resource-on-alcohol/alcohol-medication-interactions-potentially-dangerous-mixes" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increase risks&lt;/a&gt; like falling and overdose, and change how you metabolize prescriptions – people over 65 need to be especially cautious because of their slower metabolism. (Even outside hot toddy season, it’s essential to chat with your doctor about potential alcohol-medication interactions.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Alcohol may also weaken the immune system and slow down healing, Bracamonte says. Furthermore, drinking can cause dehydration, worsening symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The last thing you want to do when you have a cold is get dehydrated,” says Joan Blake, a registered dietician and clinical instructor at Boston University. “If you take in something that is going to dehydrate you, it’s sort of like filling a bucket with a hole in the bottom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It’s also likely that if you’re not feeling well, you’re not eating much. Drinking alcohol on an empty stomach can cause blood sugar levels to drop, says Blake. Low blood sugar can lead to dizziness. In particular, people who are diabetic or pre-diabetic need to monitor their blood sugar, Blake explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="whats-good-about-a-hot-toddy" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s good about a hot toddy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you take the booze out of the equation, a non-alcoholic hot toddy could help with a cold, says Bracamonte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lemon contains vitamin C, which can support the immune system, says Blake. Some &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8264544/#B133" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests consuming vitamin C may slightly shorten the duration of the common cold (though you would probably need to consume at least &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279544/#:~:text" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;200 milligrams&lt;/a&gt;; an orange has &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/sources-of-vitamin-c" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;about 83 milligrams&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://ebm.bmj.com/content/26/2/57" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4264806/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/571638#:~:text" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; honey can help reduce cough frequency and discomfort. “A little bit of honey for a cough goes a long way,” says Bracamonte. A small amount of sugar, like the amount in a dollop of honey, can provide some necessary energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-16" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hydration helps with illness, especially &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4022-upper-respiratory-infection" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;upper respiratory infections&lt;/a&gt; like colds, explains Bracamonte. Staying hydrated &lt;a href="https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/mas/news/five-ways-water-can-help-you-stay-healthy-1758946" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;helps your cells&lt;/a&gt; maintain a strong immune system, reduces the likelihood of headaches, and loosens mucus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-can-you-eat-or-drink-to-help-with-a-cold" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can you eat or drink to help with a cold?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you’re intrigued by the idea of the hot toddy, Blake recommends adding ginger because of its anti-inflammatory components and swapping in apple cider to replace the whiskey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Even if you don’t have an appetite, it’s still important to consume a small amount of sugar, “so you can have some kind of fuel,” Blake explains. A Gatorade or its equivalent could be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Bracamonte also recommends chamomile tea as a soothing beverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As for food, a 2010 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3023145/#abstract1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that eating fruits and vegetables is associated with a 20% reduction in the number of days of moderate or severe common cold symptoms. Blake also recommends classic chicken noodle soup: It is hydrating and contains a healthy balance of nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ultimately, it’s important to stay hydrated and get plenty of rest, says Bracamonte. Colds usually last three to seven days; if your illness lasts longer than that or if you’re having difficulty breathing, you should contact your healthcare provider for help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While sipping a hot toddy might sound like a bright reprieve from the monotony of feeling sick, it’s more useful to stick to the basics: sleep, eat healthy and keep those non-boozy liquids coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 17:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNd3lJcnpFeFY1MngyVkMwb3BpSXkwcFVsRWdlRHlrWTVONE0zWDRrVHNuUE9RenpQbWN1ZFNPZUh0aWxnVWtTZDAyVmZiVjg4U092NnVvejAxNVJkMkJwdlJhRmlGeEtkMXhQMm9FNTktaFNxaWFRb2hlVDNwWDFpbUdKSWdQNG53NWxaNThuVnk2Q3JZYWc</guid></item><item><title>官员告诉俄亥俄州学校像垃圾一样扔掉72只死秃鹰事实证明他们患有禽流感- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/officials-told-ohio-school-to-trash-72-dead-vultures-like-garbage-turns-out-they-had-bird-flu-2000697260</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl prose-science dark:prose-science"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;An Ohio elementary school recently became the site of an animal massacre you’d expect to see at the start of a horror movie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Staff and students at St. Bernadette’s School in Clermont County discovered 72 dead vultures on campus after returning from the Thanksgiving holiday break. It took days and mounting media pressure before state wildlife officials responded to the school’s pleas and agreed to collect and test the potentially diseased carcasses. And as it turns out, some of the birds have since tested positive for avian influenza, though the risk of infection to the public is considered low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Initially ignored&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The birds were found on campus December 1, according to local media outlet WCPO 9. School staff contacted the fire chief at Pierce Township, who reached out to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR). Despite the clear possible danger of bird flu, ODNR officials initially declined to help, saying it wasn’t part of the agency’s usual duties.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“They were very adamant that they were not coming. There was a recommendation that you just take them, put them in a bag, double-bag them and throw them in the garbage,” Pierce Township Trustee Allen Freeman &lt;a href="https://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/i-team/we-dont-know-why-the-birds-have-died-72-vultures-dead-at-clermont-county-school"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; WCPO 9. After WCPO 9’s investigative team contacted the ODNR about the situation, however, the agency changed its tune. Last Friday morning, wildlife officials arrived to collect the birds.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bird die-offs can happen for various reasons, but one of the most concerning potential culprits is a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza (HPAI). Remarkably, though, the ODNR still wasn’t planning to test the collected birds for flu—at least initially.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In a statement to WCPO 9, an ODNR spokesperson said that since some wild birds in the county had earlier tested positive for HPAI, all subsequent large die-offs (six or more dead birds) are presumed to be carrying the disease. However, a spokesperson for Clermont County Public Health stated that the department would indeed arrange for the testing of two birds. On Monday, the results came back, showing a presumptive positive for bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A low risk, for now&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Avian influenza is a serious and growing public health threat. Experts worry that an HPAI strain can eventually evolve to spread widely between humans while causing severe illness—a combination ripe for causing the next pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This danger has become all the more present in the U.S. since last year, when a strain of H5N1 bird flu started to spread widely among dairy cows and other mammals. At least 71 people in the U.S. have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html"&gt;caught&lt;/a&gt; H5N1 as well, while two are thought to have died from it. Just last month, a person in Washington exposed to wild birds and backyard chickens &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/first-human-dies-of-rare-h5n5-bird-flu-strain-heres-what-you-need-to-know/"&gt;also died&lt;/a&gt; of bird flu, albeit a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/first-ever-human-case-of-h5n5-bird-flu-found-in-washington-2000686941"&gt;different strain&lt;/a&gt; of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;For now, human cases of H5N1 and other bird flu strains remain relatively rare, and the overall risk to the public is low. But the more people are exposed to infected wild birds or other carriers, the greater the chance that one day, we might not be so lucky.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Which is why it’s all the more important to minimize these exposures as much as possible. And that’s also why it’s probably not the best idea to tell an elementary school that a bunch of dead birds isn’t a big deal to clean up on its own.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

He was soon hospitalized, ventilated and then died. Postmortem testing confirmed rabies, the CDC report said, baffling authorities because the recipient’s family had said he had not had any exposure to animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Doctors then reviewed records about the kidney donor, a man in Idaho, and discovered that in the Donor Risk Assessment Interview (DRAI) questionnaire he said he had been scratched by a skunk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When asked, the family explained that a couple of months before, in October, while he was holding a kitten in a shed on his country property, a skunk approached, showing “predatory aggression toward the kitten”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The man fought off the animal in an encounter that the report says “rendered the skunk unconscious”, but not before the man received a “shin scratch that bled”, although he did not think he had been bitten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Five weeks later, a family member said, he became confused, had difficulty walking swallowing and walking, experienced hallucinations and had a stiff neck. Two days later, he was found unresponsive at home after a presumed cardiac arrest. Although he was resuscitated and hospitalized, he never regained consciousness, and after several days was “declared brain dead and removed from life support”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The report states that several of his organs, including his left kidney, were donated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After rabies was suspected in the kidney recipient, authorities went back to test laboratory samples from the donor; they tested negative for rabies. But biopsy samples directly from his kidneys did detect a strain “consistent with a silver-haired bat rabies”, suggesting that he had, in fact, died of rabies and had passed it on to the donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The investigation suggested a “likely three-step transmission chain” in which a bat infected a skunk, which infected the donor, whose kidney then infected the donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC said it was only the fourth reported transplant-transmitted rabies event in the United States since 1978. It noted that the risk for any transplant-transmitted infection, including rabies, is extremely low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After discovering that three people also received cornea grafts from the same donor, authorities immediately removed the grafts and administered Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) to prevent infection. The three people remained asymptomatic, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC report stated that in the US, family members often provide information about a prospective donor’s infectious disease risk factors, including animal exposures. Rabies is typically “excluded from routine donor pathogen testing because of its rarity in humans in the United States and the complexity of diagnostic testing”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“In this case, hospital staff members who treated the donor were initially unaware of the skunk scratch and attributed his pre-admission signs and symptoms to chronic co-morbidities,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In an interview with the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/06/health/rabies-death-skunk-kidney-transplant.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Lara Danziger-Isakov, the director of immunocompromised host infectious diseases at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, described the incident as “an exceptionally rare event”, adding that “overall, the risk is exceptionally small”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxOWnhPUGlzVGYzT3Mycl8yYjFIWGYyODNseUxPdnhqMVFlLTZma0tXdDVqSC1UNnpnNi05d2VVSWZ1Um5DUUF6Z2FTUEVTemM5QzhOVkE4SXhZVEpicW5nbEZEU1pySzFWd2s0VG9uV0xqTmlOSkxMeHdlNkxLVENwRk1uZjd3NUk</guid></item><item><title>睡眠不足强烈预测预期寿命缩短-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/sleep-life-expectancy-30028/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new nationwide analysis shows that getting fewer than seven hours of sleep a night is one of the strongest predictors of shorter life expectancy across U.S. counties. Sleep sufficiency outperformed other behavioral factors—including diet, exercise, and loneliness—with only smoking showing a stronger association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings reveal a consistent year-to-year correlation between sleep duration and lifespan in nearly every state. Researchers say the results underscore the urgent need to treat sleep as a core pillar of long-term health rather than a luxury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep Outranks Other Factors:&lt;/strong&gt; Insufficient sleep predicted shorter life expectancy more strongly than diet, exercise, or loneliness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nationwide Pattern:&lt;/strong&gt; Correlations appeared across almost every U.S. state from 2019–2025.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep affects cardiovascular, immune, and brain function, offering multiple pathways to longevity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Oregon Health and Science University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A good night’s sleep is more than a luxury: New research from Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University suggests that insufficient sleep may shorten your life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;SLEEP Advances&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers tapped a vast, nationwide database looking for survey trends associated with average life expectancy county by county.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a behavioral driver for life expectancy, sleep stood out more than diet, more than exercise, more than loneliness — indeed, more than any other factor except smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t expect it to be so strongly correlated to life expectancy,” said senior author Andrew McHill, Ph.D., associate professor in the OHSU School of Nursing, the OHSU School of Medicine and OHSU’s Oregon Institute of Occupational Health Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve always thought sleep is important, but this research really drives that point home: People really should strive to get seven to nine hours of sleep if at all possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted primarily by graduate students in the Sleep, Chronobiology and Health Laboratory of the OHSU School of Nursing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have broadly understood the importance of sufficient sleep for a variety of positive health outcomes. However, McHill and co-authors said they were surprised by the strength of the connection to life expectancy. The effect of insufficient sleep swamped the impact of diet and exercise as a predictor of life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s intuitive and makes a lot of sense, but it was still striking to see it materialize so strongly in all of these models,” McHill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m a sleep physiologist who understands the health benefits of sleep, but the strength of the association between sleep sufficiency and life expectancy was remarkable to me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although previous research has shown broadly that lack of adequate sleep leads to higher mortality risk, the new research is the first to reveal year-to-year correlations between sleep and life expectancy for every U.S. state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of modeling, the CDC defined sufficient sleep as at least seven hours a night, which is recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found clear correlations in each year and in most U.S. states between sleep and life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statistical analysis did not delve into reasons why inadequate sleep appears to shorten life expectancy, but McHill noted that sleep influences cardiovascular health, the immune system and brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research shows that we need to prioritize sleep at least as much as we do to what we eat or how we exercise,” he said. “Sometimes, we think of sleep as something we can set aside and maybe put off until later or on the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Getting a good night’s sleep will improve how you feel but also how long you live.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to McHill, co-authors include lead author Kathryn E. McAuliffe, B.S., Madeline R. Wary, B.S., Gemma V. Pleas, B.A., Kiziah E.S. Pugmire, B.S., Courtney Lysiak, B.A., Nathan F. Dieckmann, Ph.D., and Brooke M.

Moreover, sleep insufficiency was significantly associated with lower life expectancy when controlling for traditional predictors of mortality, with only smoking displaying a stronger association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings demonstrate the importance of adequate sleep in all communities regardless of income level, access to health care services, or geographical classification.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:03:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTFB6b094RU9UTTlvS1hFazFoU3lkWnB6OHQ2MHpzR1lfUVg5cld3THROdTFBY2hGNmc2Tl9DOW5zN0xuWk5PN3lFcnJ2ckMtdVl4UEN6b1dMS2lXaWluRV9PMVFDSDR0RG9n</guid></item><item><title>帕金森病正在上升。5个降低患病风险的专家提示- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/09/health/parkinson-risk-reduction-wellness</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Those are the words Dr. James Parkinson used in &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/jnp.14.2.223" target="_blank"&gt;an essay&lt;/a&gt; more than 200 years ago to group together symptoms and describe a mysterious infirmity afflicting six individuals in London. The British physician was the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/140/3/843/3053438" target="_blank"&gt;first to identify&lt;/a&gt; and document the condition now known as Parkinson’s disease, a progressive movement disorder. Its hallmark is damage to the dopamine-producing neurons in the brain that can lead to muscle stiffness, slowness, balance issues and a host of other problems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22581-dopamine" target="_blank"&gt;Dopamine is a crucial neurotransmitter &lt;/a&gt;involved in our brain’s reward system. The chemical plays a central role in motivation, as well as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4084861/" target="_blank"&gt;executive function&lt;/a&gt; (which includes attention, decision-making, multitasking and planning), movement and emotional regulation.

            By 2021, public health researchers  reported there were &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/15/4/e095610" target="_blank"&gt;almost 12 million cases&lt;/a&gt; worldwide. And the number of people living with Parkinson’s is projected to &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/388/bmj-2024-080952" target="_blank"&gt;top 25 million&lt;/a&gt; by 2050. The disease not only &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41531-020-0117-1" target="_blank"&gt;substantially burdens&lt;/a&gt; the individual, but also their family, their community and society as a whole.

            “We’re now growing as a neurodegenerative disease faster than Alzheimer’s disease — that should grab everybody’s attention,” neurologist Dr. Michael Okun told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast, Chasing Life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4da7a000e3b6ncmjxtj6m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Parkinson’s disease is so much more than just a shaking palsy, as scientists have come to learn since 1817, but there is still quite a ways to go in identifying its root causes, understanding more fully the progression of the disease, and even developing a foolproof diagnostic test.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4da7a000f3b6n4ev6avjs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It becomes obvious, just absolutely obvious, when you see the folks with disease that this isn’t just a disease of dopamine; it isn’t just a disease of the brain. We see it in the gut. We see it in the skin. We see it in multiple organs,” said Okun, who cofounded and codirects the Norman Fixel Institute for Neurological Diseases at the University of Florida, in Gainesville, and is the medical director and medical adviser for the Parkinson’s Foundation. “So, it is super important that we ask the why: Why does it start? Why does it progress? Why does it spread?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4da7a000g3b6na3b4m2v9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.parkinson.org/advancing-research/our-research/pdgeneration/genetics-behind-pd" target="_blank"&gt;Genetics&lt;/a&gt; plays a key role in between 10% and 15% of cases. For many others, Okun said, the underlying cause of the disease might be more mundane and insidious: &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11091623/" target="_blank"&gt;environmental toxins&lt;/a&gt; — via the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3114824/" target="_blank"&gt;the chemicals&lt;/a&gt; with which we regularly come in contact.

            “We have such an opportunity now to understand, hey, we don’t have to live in a world where we think it’s inevitable to get Parkinson’s,” Okun said. His latest book on the disease, “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Parkinsons-Plan-Path-Prevention-Treatment/dp/1541705386/" target="_blank"&gt;The Parkinson’s Plan&lt;/a&gt;: A New Path to Prevention and Treatment,” cowritten with Dr. Ray Dorsey, in part explores the associations between the disease and a host of chemicals that &lt;a href="https://movementdisorders.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mds.29371" target="_blank"&gt;quietly assail&lt;/a&gt; our bodies.

            “A simple carbon filter can reduce the &lt;a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/camp-lejeune/about/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/sites/lejeune/background.html" target="_blank"&gt;invisible toxicants&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10186205/" target="_blank"&gt;sneak into drinking water&lt;/a&gt; and may stress vulnerable brain systems,” he said. “Clean water lowers the everyday chemical load your gut and brain must handle.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000l3b6nog29wypb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These filters can reduce exposure to pesticides and chemicals like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7941732/" target="_blank"&gt;trichlorethylene, or TCE&lt;/a&gt;, a common chemical used to dry-clean clothes, decaffeinate coffee and degrease metal, as well as other impurities. (In December 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency announced an almost &lt;a href="https://www.michaeljfox.org/news/landmark-victory-parkinsons-community-epa-bans-trichloroethylene" target="_blank"&gt;complete ban of TCE&lt;/a&gt;, but lawsuits have so far &lt;a href="https://www.safetyandhealthmagazine.com/articles/27607-epa-further-delays-provisions-of-trichloroethylene-ban" target="_blank"&gt;stayed the &lt;/a&gt;rule’s effective start date under certain circumstances.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Use air purifiers both at home and work.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Removing &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8583112/" target="_blank"&gt;fine particulate matter&lt;/a&gt; from indoor air protects the nose-to-brain pathway that may seed Parkinson’s,” Okun said. “Cleaner air means fewer triggers entering through the brain’s front door.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000o3b6n6dg8yoi5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Make sure to use an air purifier with a carbon filter designed to remove volatile organic chemicals, or VOCs, such as TCE. &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/volatile-organic-compounds-impact-indoor-air-quality#:~:text=Volatile%20organic%20compounds%20(VOCs)%20are,cosmetic%2C%20degreasing%20and%20hobby%20products." target="_blank"&gt;Volatile organic compounds are gases&lt;/a&gt; that can be emitted from solid or liquid products, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. These chemicals can cause problems such as eye, nose and throat irritation and damage to the liver, kidney and central nervous system, the federal agency said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Take the time to wash your fruits and vegetables, even if they are organic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000r3b6nn4d2ajsr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Rinsing and scrubbing your produce … helps remove pesticide residues that can quietly injure mitochondria over time,” Okun noted. “This simple daily habit lowers the exposure load your brain and nervous system must manage.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000s3b6nnkhnn86p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And just as you would when washing your hands, you should rinse them for more than 20 seconds, Okun added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader_elevate vossi-subheader_elevate--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmiy4e2eh00133b6nzqluc9bf@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="keep-your-body-moving" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Keep your body moving
&lt;/h2&gt;

            Exercise every day. Regular movement is thought to prevent or delay the onset of Parkinson’s disease — and it is also crucial for people who already live with the disorder.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000v3b6n87p5vvmv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Exercise every day, using four 20-minute walks (~7000 steps), or an equivalent routine that keeps you moving throughout the day,” Okun said via email. “Movement wakes up natural dopamine circuits, improves mobility, and may possibly slow symptom progression.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000w3b6nlbochgs9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For those who feel unsteady on their feet, Okun noted that a recumbent stationary bike is a safe and effective alternative.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000x3b6n8cnrfv9y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Prioritize  consistent, high-quality sleep to give your brain a chance to recover every night.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000y3b6nb3r3vmm3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Deep sleep activates the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4636982/" target="_blank"&gt;brain’s built-in cleaning system&lt;/a&gt;, flushing toxins and helping symptoms improve the following day,” Okun said. “Protecting sleep is protecting brain health, especially when living with or aiming to prevent Parkinson’s.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000z3b6n10xbzrop@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then, when you get up in the morning, enjoy a cup of caffeinated coffee or tea. Research has consistently associated caffeine consumption with a lower risk of Parkinson’s Disease ; it is believed to protect the dopamine-producing nerve cells from damage caused by environmental toxins.
    &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Back in 2023, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/01/ancient-roman-concrete-could-self-heal-thanks-to-hot-mixing-with-quicklime/"&gt;we reported&lt;/a&gt; on MIT scientists’ conclusion that the ancient Romans employed “hot mixing” with quicklime, among other strategies, to make their famous concrete, giving the material self-healing functionality. The only snag was that this didn’t match the recipe as described in historical texts. Now the same team is back with a fresh analysis of samples collected from a recently discovered site that confirms the Romans did indeed use hot mixing, according to a new paper published in the journal Nature Communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we’ve &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/noblewomans-tomb-reveals-new-secrets-of-ancient-romes-highly-durable-concrete/"&gt;reported previously&lt;/a&gt;, like today’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_cement" data-uri="7e5fcbf7f79050078486c69c2a8120d1"&gt;Portland cement&lt;/a&gt; (a basic ingredient of modern concrete), ancient &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_concrete" data-uri="57459e017b35b6cdf856f9fbc4b450d3"&gt;Roman concrete&lt;/a&gt; was basically a mix of a semi-liquid mortar and aggregate. Portland cement is typically made by heating limestone and clay (as well as sandstone, ash, chalk, and iron) in a kiln. The resulting clinker is then ground into a fine powder with just a touch of added gypsum to achieve a smooth, flat surface. But the aggregate used to make Roman concrete was made up of fist-sized pieces of stone or bricks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his treatise &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_architectura" data-uri="eea6afa7452c7f0ebb23ac2d0cb07a89"&gt;&lt;em&gt;De architectura&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (circa 30 CE), the Roman architect and engineer &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius" data-uri="3509522d11f467111a16bc495afbaac9"&gt;Vitruvius&lt;/a&gt; wrote about how to build concrete walls for funerary structures that could endure for a long time without falling into ruin. He recommended the walls be at least two feet thick, made of either “squared red stone or of brick or lava laid in courses.” The brick or volcanic rock aggregate should be bound with mortar composed of hydrated lime and porous fragments of glass and crystals from volcanic eruptions (known as volcanic tephra).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admir Masic, an environmental engineer at MIT, has studied ancient Roman concrete for several years. For instance, in 2019, Masic helped pioneer a new set of tools for analyzing Roman concrete samples from Privernum at multiple length scales—notably, Raman spectroscopy for chemical profiling and multi-detector energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) for phase mapping the material. Masic was also a co-author of a &lt;a href="https://ceramics.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jace.18133"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; analyzing samples of the ancient concrete used to build a 2,000-year-old mausoleum along the Appian Way in Rome known as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Caecilia_Metella" data-uri="a1e0e058f4d17139857bbc00170dfbdb"&gt;Tomb of Caecilia Metella&lt;/a&gt;, a noblewoman who lived in the first century CE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in 2023, Masic’s group analyzed samples taken from the concrete walls of the Privernum, focusing on strange white mineral chunks known as “lime clasts,” which others had largely dismissed as resulting from subpar raw materials or poor mixing. Masic et al. &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add1602"&gt;concluded that&lt;/a&gt; was not the case. Rather, the Romans deliberately employed “hot mixing” with quicklime that gave the material self-healing functionality. When cracks begin to form in the concrete, they are more likely to move through the lime clasts. The clasts can then react with water, producing a solution saturated with calcium. That solution can either recrystallize as calcium carbonate to fill the cracks or react with the pozzolanic components to strengthen the composite material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="8e865027-b6bc-4a71-bca7-115096375383"&gt;New research in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2842444" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;JAMA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; finds that more parents are opting out of giving their babies a recommended vitamin K shot at birth. And that puts babies at risk, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know unequivocally that infants that don't receive vitamin K are at significantly higher risk of getting serious bleeding," the lead study author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/vitamin-k-shot-given-at-birth-prevents-lethal-brain-bleeds-but-more-parents/" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;told Scientific American&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All newborns are &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/prenatal/delivery-beyond/Pages/Where-We-Stand-Administration-of-Vitamin-K.aspx" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;recommended to receive an injection of vitamin K&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrient that helps the body form blood clots. Older children and adults get vitamin K from their diets and their gut microbiomes, but babies are born with very little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nutrient doesn't easily pass through the placenta and babies' microbiomes are too immature to make it; breast milk also contains relatively little vitamin K, and regardless, vitamin K given to babies by mouth isn't absorbed well. That means babies are vulnerable to vitamin K deficiency, which can lead to dangerous bleeding, and in turn, permanent brain damage or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one-time vitamin K shot protects babies from this deficiency extremely effectively and safely. Since universal administration of the vitamin was started in 1961, the U.S. has "nearly eliminated" vitamin K deficiency bleeding. But now, our &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://publications.aap.org/hospitalpediatrics/article-abstract/10/3/286/26024/Refusal-of-Intramuscular-Vitamin-K-by-Parents-of?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;numbers are slipping&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JAMA analysis found that, between 2017 and 2024, the rate of vitamin K shot refusal has risen nearly 80%, with the proportion of newborns not given the shot rising from 2.92% to 5.18%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anecdotally, I've seen my share of breathless, online influencers spreading misinformation about vitamin K shots. Their efforts are closely tied to — if not indistinguishable from — the anti-vaccine movement, despite vitamin K shots not being vaccines. Often, the influencers promote unproven alternatives to the shot, which they personally happen to sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But to put it plainly: when vitamin K administration goes down, the rate of babies dying goes up. The new JAMA study calls attention to that disturbing trend.

&lt;p id="5ef6da5b-e0d9-433a-8ec2-24b2a863a3d9"&gt;XRISM observed comet 3I/ATLAS between Nov. 26 and Nov. 28, just as the comet moved far enough away from the sun to be visible to the telescope’s instruments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Comets are enveloped by clouds of gas produced as sunlight heats and vaporizes their icy surfaces," XRISM representatives wrote in a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xrism.jaxa.jp/en/topics/news/1208/" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "When this gas interacts with the energetic stream of charged particles flowing from the Sun — the solar wind — a process called charge-exchange reaction occurs, producing characteristic X-ray emission."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers described the glow in the X-ray image as a "faint emission structure" and said it was potentially the result of a diffuse cloud of gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers also noted that instrumental effects such as vignetting or detector noise can create similar structures in images, so they'll have to do follow-up analysis to confirm whether the extensive emission structure belongs to the comet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Moving forward, the XRISM team will continue refining its data processing and analysis to further reveal the activity of this interstellar comet and the nature of its interaction with the solar wind," the representatives wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, they're failing.&lt;/p&gt;

The final text of the COP30 agreement didn't contain any &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/22/roadmaps-adaptations-and-transitions-what-climate-measures-were-agreed-at-cop30" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;clear mention of fossil fuels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which are the primary source of increased greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="8edf36cc-9124-4b5d-8879-fc14311af94c"&gt;EngineAI said that the purpose of the simulated fight was to counter claims that its latest model was a CGI creation, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/12/07/world/video/engineai-chinese-ceo-kicked-by-humanoid-robot-t800-digvid" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CNN reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the T800 appears to have a decent kick, it doesn't go unnoticed that Tongyang was standing still, waiting patiently for his robot to strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, don't expect to see robots beating UFC fighters anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

That's the takeaway from a gigantic particle detector located a mile underground in South Dakota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 417-day-long experiment, known as LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), looked at the light signatures released as particles collide with xenon atoms in a giant vat, which is placed deep underground so that most particles from space cannot muddy the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark matter, which emits no light yet exerts gravitational force, is thought to make up most of the universe.

&lt;p id="a20d76ea-e4e8-40fb-8f54-b073644b85fb"&gt;Japan has downgraded its tsunami warning to a tsunami advisory. The initial warning meant that the authorities &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.data.jma.go.jp/multi/tsunami/tsunami_advisory.html?lang=en" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;expected a maximum tsunami height&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of between 3.3 feet and 9.8 feet (1 and 3 m).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, an "advisory" level means that the expected maximum height has been reduced to 3.3 feet, in keeping with the wave heights recorded thus far.&lt;/p&gt;

CMEs have the potential to clash with Earth's magnetic field and trigger geomagnetic storms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow's strong geomagnetic storm forecast is associated with the eruption of a solar flare on Saturday. The resulting CME is predicted to arrive at midday tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Space Weather Prediction Center noted that the CME could also have limited, minor effects on technological infrastructure, but this can usually be mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ad3d32a5-827f-43a8-acfb-1a9f39d3e519"&gt;Parts of the Northern Hemisphere could see some auroras on Monday, according to Live Science's sister site &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://space.com" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Space.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Space Weather Prediction Center has forecast a less intense &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/forecast-discussio" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;G1 geomagnetic storm&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a result of a separate CME that left the sun on Dec. 4, while the U.K.'s Met Office has the more intense G3 watch in place for tonight and tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our sun is very active at the moment. The Space Weather Prediction Center recorded another powerful &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/x11-flare-was-observed-080501-utc" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;solar flare&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier today. The X1.1-level flare triggered high-frequency radio disruptions over parts of Australia and southern Asia, according to NOAA.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"I went to see our family doctor because my arm was hurting for over a week. He diagnosed it as 'tennis elbow' and told me to take anti-inflammatories. Weeks later, I lost most of the feeling in my hand, so I was given nerve conduction tests, then imaging. It turned out I had under 50% of the normal nerve conduction, because I'd originally broken my arm and it healed badly, crushing the nerve in my elbow. I needed urgent surgery to chisel away the extra bone around the nerve. The neurosurgeon doing the operation injected the local anesthetic and waited for it to go numb. He checked my sensation and I could feel everything. Another shot. Same result. I told him to go ahead and I'd just put up with it. It was a tad painful, to say the least. If you imagine somebody literally chiselling away at your funny bone carefully for 4 hours, you'll get some idea.

Collagen is the protein that keeps skin firm, smooth, and bouncy. The body makes its own collagen, but production slows with age, stress, sun exposure, and poor diet. While fruits don’t contain collagen directly, many of them provide vitamin C, antioxidants, and amino acids–supporting nutrients that help the body build it naturally. Here are five fruits that stand out for their skin-supporting strength.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 13:35:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>根治性新疗法清除64%无法治愈的癌症患者的疾病- IFLScience</title><link>https://www.iflscience.com/radical-new-treatment-clears-disease-in-64-percent-of-patients-with-incurable-cancer-81836</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p data-pasted="true"&gt;Patients with previously incurable cancer are seeing incredible results thanks to a pioneering new treatment that has just completed early trials. The world-first gene therapy is called BE-CAR7, and it’s being tested in children and adults with an aggressive form of leukemia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first patient to undergo the treatment was Alyssa Tapley, now aged 16. Tapley, from Leicester in the UK, was diagnosed with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in May 2021. Her &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/tags/cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; did not respond to the standard treatments of chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant, which is true for about 20 percent of children with this diagnosis. The family were essentially out of options when the clinical trial was proposed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I chose to take part in the research as I felt that, even if it didn’t work for me, it could help others,” Tapley said in a &lt;a href="https://www.gosh.nhs.uk/news/ready-made-t-cell-gene-therapy-tackles-incurable-t-cell-leukaemia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BE-CAR7 treatment is a multi-step process developed by researchers at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) and University College London. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy donor white blood cells are first modified to make them “universal” by removing surface receptors and nullified by removing an immune marker called CD7. This prevents the recipient’s immune system from simply destroying the new cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another surface protein called CD52 is then removed. This hides the donor cells from the powerful immune-suppressing drugs that are given to the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, a new DNA sequence is added to the cells via a modified virus, which allows the cells to produce the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10110629/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;chimeric antigen receptor&lt;/a&gt; (CAR). This is the secret weapon that allows the donor cells to target cancerous T-cells inside the patient’s body. CAR-T cell treatments have been particularly promising for blood cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These perfectly engineered cells are then given to the patient, where they will hopefully go to town on the cancer cells and destroy them. The ideal timeline is four weeks, after which the patient can then receive a &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/what-happens-if-you-donate-your-bone-marrow-and-the-recipient-commits-a-crime-74783" target="_blank"&gt;bone marrow transplant&lt;/a&gt; to rebuild their own immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span contenteditable="false" draggable="true" class="fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FGnYaZgLdyo?&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" class="fr-draggable"&gt;VIDEO&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Tapley’s case, it worked. She first shared her story back in 2022, but since then her cancer has remained undetectable and she’s been able to get back to enjoying life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve gone sailing, spent time away from home doing my Duke of Edinburgh Award but even just going to school is something I dreamed of when I was ill. I’m not taking anything for granted. Next on my list is learning to drive, but my ultimate goal is to become a research scientist and be part of the next big discovery that can help people like me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Seeing Alyssa go from strength-to-strength is incredible and a testament to her tenacity and the dedication of an array of small army of people at GOSH,” added investigator and bone marrow transplant consultant Dr Rob Chiesa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="fr-image-container no-background" data-asset-id="87955" data-reactroot=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="fr-figcaption"&gt;&lt;p class="fr-caption"&gt;Alyssa Tapley with her father, James.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="fr-reference"&gt;Image credit: courtesy of Alyssa's family&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, in a new paper and presentation at the 67th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting, the team is reporting the results of a phase 1 trial of BE-CAR7 in eight children and two adults. The results were once again promising: 82 percent of the patients achieved “very deep remissions” and were able to proceed to the bone marrow transplant, and 64 percent of them are still disease-free, some of them for three years at this point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that not all the patients originally recruited into the trial survived the treatment. There are side effects and it takes a long time for a person’s immune system to rebuild after a bone marrow transplant, during which extreme care must be taken to avoid infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are intense and difficult treatments – patients and families have been generous in recognising the importance of learning as much as possible from each experience,” said lead researcher Professor Waseem Qasim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for a cancer this rare and aggressive, the team says this treatment offers hope where none really existed before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve seen impressive responses in clearing leukaemia that seemed incurable – it’s a very powerful approach,” said consultant hematologist Dr Deborah Yallop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immunotherapies like &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/pioneering-gene-therapy-cures-patients-cancer-and-is-still-working-10-years-on-62482" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;CAR-T cell therapy&lt;/a&gt; have been &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/new-multiple-myeloma-immunotherapy-puts-90-percent-of-patients-into-full-remission-69156" target="_blank"&gt;revolutionary&lt;/a&gt; in cancer treatment in recent decades. Given the success of this trial, charitable funding has been made available to support treatment of a further 10 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a comment to the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-looking-at-universal-base-edited-car7-t-cells-for-t-cell-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/" target="_blank"&gt;Science Media Centre&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Tania Dexter, senior medical officer at UK stem cell charity Anthony Nolan – which &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/discover-the-life-saving-potential-of-stem-cells-at-the-worlds-first-stem-cell-register-76129" target="_blank"&gt;IFLScience visited last year&lt;/a&gt; – reacted to the news. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results of the study are promising, with most patients achieving levels of remission allowing them to receive a stem cell transplant. Considering these patients had a low chance of survival before the trial, these results bring hope that treatments like this will continue to advance and become available to more patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2505478#sec-1" target="_blank"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 13:14:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxOTFZYaE9WU1U1eHd6eHpJeGc5T21ySjJyUlhLUG5TRVN4ZUtjYlR3VFBKeGdKdU9vR2VOaDlRdG51U1Z0bmY5amwxRjhMMDBsNG91ZUZBUlVhazhNN0hZam11Yks0RGwwOS1WY0dnTU5CTFp1aFA0T3ppbEs2ZElBSG5xQlVHbFNKdnpyRjh2SEVnN2FFOXRqNm5JS1JILVVtcHc2TzBMMXpBVHZtelVLTkNOVDlBYVM0</guid></item><item><title>与一只新小狗一起“沉思她的新生活”的黄金猎犬TikTok破解了-雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/golden-retriever-contemplating-her-life-120500633.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We see a ton of pet-related social media posts and accounts.

As you can probably guess, one of those goldens is named Leia. And Leia's got a new younger sister, Daisy. Only one problem. According to a recent 10-second TikTok video, Daisy has Leia "contemplating her new life," in which she has a pesky younger sister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The video is captioned "Leia's contemplating her new life" and begins with Leia putting her front legs up on the couch, while her human parent films the interaction. Leia is trying hard to get away from Daisy, who is also standing on her hind legs and putting her front paws on the couch, mimicking her older sister and also getting closer to their human parent. The video captions what they imagine Leia is saying: "Mom, she's bothering me again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/dog-face" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐶;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🐶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/parade-pets" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:SIGN UP to get "pawsitivity" delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP to get "pawsitivity" delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/paw-prints" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐾🐾;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🐾🐾&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;"Mom, She's Bothering Me Again"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Daisy then moves in closer, putting her paws on her big sister, Leia. Leia immediately tries hard again to move away, and the caption on the screen reads, "Ew, too close." Daisy leans in even harder, putting her head on Leia, and the caption switches to narrating what Daisy must be thinking. "But sister, I just want to playyy," the caption says. Then the video pans back to show just a close-up of Leia's face with the caption reading, "Can we return this thing?" And that's how the video ends!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/puppy-thought-getting-versus-puppy-230500896.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: 'Puppy I Thought I Was Getting' Versus 'Puppy I Got' Video Is Cracking People Up;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: 'Puppy I Thought I Was Getting' Versus 'Puppy I Got' Video Is Cracking People Up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some other TikTok users chime in in the comments with their own narrations of what Leia must be thinking and trying to communicate. "Can we return it? I'll drop her off at FedEx," TikTok user @balian76 commented. "Get this thing away from me," another TikTok user adds. "Excuse me, Mother, but this is unbearable. I simply can't even," TikTok user @MissKate also comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are many benefits to getting another dog as a companion for your current dog. The first benefit is just that—companionship. Especially if you're frequently out of the house for work or travel, this can give your dog some social interaction and a friend to keep them company. It's also a good way to increase your dog's activity. Younger dogs have more energy and love to play, keeping your older dog engaged and active. There are, of course, some things to consider. Mostly, it's important to be absolutely certain that both you and your current dog can handle the significant lifestyle change and all that comes with owning two dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/golden-retriever-thinks-hes-invisible-110500419.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: Golden Retriever Who Thinks He's Invisible While Stalking His Brother Has Us in Stitches;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: Golden Retriever Who Thinks He's Invisible While Stalking His Brother Has Us in Stitches&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally published by &lt;a href="https://pethelpful.com/pet-news/golden-retriever-contemplating-new-life-with-puppy-tiktok" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PetHelpful;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PetHelpful&lt;/a&gt; on Dec 9, 2025, where it first appeared in the &lt;a href="https://pethelpful.com/pet-news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pet News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Pet News&lt;/a&gt; section.

In it, 20 adults ate one of two diets, which were identical in nutrients and differed only in their level of processing. Participants who ate ultra-processed foods (UPFs) consumed about 500 kilocalories more per day and gained weight, whereas those on a minimally processed diet lost weight. The results offered strong evidence that many industrially produced foods can override satiety signals and drive overeating. And it made Hall one of the most influential figures in nutritional science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02754-w" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03977-7/d41586-025-03977-7_51412508.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Are ultra-processed foods really so unhealthy? What the science says&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understandably, expectations were high for his book, &lt;i&gt;Food Intelligence&lt;/i&gt;, co-written with Canadian journalist Julia Belluz. It digs deeper into the implications of the 2019 study — that the harms of processed foods can’t be reduced to their fat, sugar or salt content alone, and that the prevalent government strategy of politely asking companies to tweak their recipes by cutting salt or sugar content, say, is unlikely to address rising obesity rates. Unfortunately, the execution only partly lives up to the promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this wide-ranging primer on food science, Hall and Belluz revisit many food-related misconceptions. They debunk the idea that cutting 500 kilocalories a day reliably leads to the loss of half a kilogram a week and that “broken metabolism” explains obesity — as Hall showed in his studies on contestants who participated in &lt;i&gt;The Biggest Loser&lt;/i&gt;, a reality television programme built around extreme weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-04163-x" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03977-7/d41586-025-03977-7_51793264.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Are you what you eat? How food shapes self-image&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors challenge the current obsession with protein, noting that most people already consume enough through ordinary diets. They are equally dismissive of the booming supplements industry, arguing that many products lack clinical evidence or have been shown to offer no real benefit. Their scepticism extends to continuous glucose monitoring in people without diabetes, which they warn might provoke needless anxiety without providing clear advantages. The critique culminates in a forceful take down of the personalized-nutrition industry — diet plans based on genetics, which they argue have no solid scientific basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Limited legislation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By tracing the origins of the limited control the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) exerts over food additives and supplements, the authors provide valuable context for why the US food environment is particularly problematic. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 ensured that dietary supplements do not require premarket approval. The FDA also allows companies to introduce additive chemicals into food if these are merely ‘&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-ingredients-packaging/generally-recognized-safe-gras" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-ingredients-packaging/generally-recognized-safe-gras" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;generally recognized as safe&lt;/a&gt;’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lax regulatory framework, shaped heavily by food-industry lobbying, stands in stark contrast to the stricter regimes in much of Europe and Latin America. Some countries now warn the public about highly processed foods, yet nutrition-guideline committees in the United States and United Kingdom still decline to mention them as potentially harmful, even as the FDA has been asked to consider the issue in its upcoming review. The status quo persists despite multiple observational studies, Hall’s influential 2019 clinical trial and studies that have replicated his findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03977-7/d41586-025-03977-7_51787772.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03977-7/d41586-025-03977-7_51787772.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Kevin Hall, sitting in an hospital room, speaks to someone off camera." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03977-7/d41586-025-03977-7_51787772.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Nutrition researcher Kevin Hall dispels widely held misconceptions about food.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Mark Schiefelbein/AP Photo/Alamy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of solutions, the book argues that “personal responsibility” plays little part in nutrition — a point that, if pushed too rigidly, can feel disempowering. The authors insist that the real challenge lies in reshaping the “toxic food environment” that drives overconsumption. They call for tighter regulation and greater transparency on additives, reformulation of industrial products, and taxes on ultra-processed foods to shift diets towards whole foods, fruit and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a powerful message, and one that deserves wider attention, even if the book’s practical diet suggestions are underwhelming: eat less meat, eat more fruit and vegetables, and store junk food out of sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;A barrage of &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/future-society/social-media-children-brain-rot"&gt;AI-generated brain rot&lt;/a&gt; is haunting children across numerous screens, from personal smartphones to school-issued laptops to televisions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Social media is adding significantly to that cacophony, making it harder than ever for kids to concentrate. Now, new research from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University has found a significant link between screen time and diagnoses of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), suggesting that exposing young brains to social media could have major mental health implications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;As detailed in a &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatricsopenscience/article/doi/10.1542/pedsos.2025-000922/205729/Digital-Media-Genetics-and-Risk-for-ADHD-Symptoms?autologincheck=redirected" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Pediatrics Open Science&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers followed 8,324 children aged nine to ten years old in the US for four years. The children self-reported how much time they spent on social media, watching TV, or playing video games. Their parents also assessed their ability to pay attention and any signs of hyperactivity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;There was a clear link between social media use and an attention deficit, raising the possibility that the constant sensory assault by online services like TikTok and Snapchat could be robbing kids of the ability to focus. That’s in contrast to TV or video game use, which showed no clear association with symptoms of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Our study suggests that it is specifically social media that affects children’s ability to concentrate,” said coauthor and Karolinska Institutet professor of cognitive neuroscience Torkel Klingberg in a &lt;a href="https://news.ki.se/using-social-media-may-impair-childrens-attention" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The researchers found that over the four years, children went from spending an average of 30 minutes a day to 2.5 hours a day on social media. Meanwhile, inattention symptoms also increased.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Social media entails constant distractions in the form of messages and notifications, and the mere thought of whether a message has arrived can act as a mental distraction,” Klingberg added. “This affects the ability to stay focused and could explain the association.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;While it’s always hard to figure out causation in research like this, one clue is that children who were already struggling with symptoms of ADHD at the outset of the study didn’t start using social media more, suggesting that its use leads to inattentiveness, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Importantly, there was no evidence of reverse association, as average inattention symptoms did not predict increased social media use,” the paper reads.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Interestingly, an increase in social media use was shown to have no effect on hyperactivity, which is also a symptom associated with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Although the effect size is small at the individual level, it could have significant consequences if behavior changes across population level,” the researchers wrote in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;As such, the number of ADHD diagnoses in the US is &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/05/23/1252941968/adhd-diagnoses-are-rising-1-in-9-u-s-kids-have-gotten-one-new-study-finds" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;rising&lt;/a&gt;. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15374416.2024.2335625" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt;, one in nine US kids is now living with the disorder, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention categorizing it as an “&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/research-news/19960/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;expanding public health concern&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;As of 2022, there were over seven million kids and adolescents in the US with a diagnosis of the condition, up from just over six million in 2016, a significant rise in only a matter of six years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;According to Klingberg, social media may have contributed to the trend over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Greater consumption of social media might explain part of the increase we’re seeing in ADHD diagnoses, even if ADHD is also associated with hyperactivity, which didn’t increase in our study,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The researchers stressed that their findings didn’t establish explicit, causative links and that social media use doesn’t necessarily imply a child will develop ADHD symptoms. However, they suggest parents should discuss limiting the time children spend on social media each day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“We hope that our findings will help parents and policymakers make well-informed decisions on healthy digital consumption that support children’s cognitive development,” said first author and Karolinska Institutet postdoctoral researcher Samson Nivins, in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;

Mice fed AL were allowed free access to food at all times and never ran out of food. The mice on the DR regimen received 50% of their average daily (normal) intake of food. Mice on DR were given pre-weighed pellets between 09:00 h and 11:00 h every day of the experiment. Following 1 week on their respective diet, mice were subcutaneously injected with 2.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; (EO771) or 5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; (B16-OVA) cells into the right abdominal flank. Tumour volume was measured every 2–3 days with a calliper once tumours became palpable. Tumour initiation was scored as a tumour volume of ≥250 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Mice were euthanized when the tumour volume reached 1,500 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. For experiments involving anti-PD1 treatment, mice received 200 µg of IgG (BP0091; RRID: AB_1107773) or anti-PD1 (BP0033-2; RRID:AB_1107747) antibodies intraperitoneally every 3 days, for a total of five injections (1 mg of antibody total). Treatment was initiated 7 days after tumour cell injection. The maximal tumour size permitted by the ethical regulations was 1,500 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and this limit was not exceeded in any experiment. Animals were monitored regularly for signs of discomfort or distress, and any animal reaching predefined humane endpoints was euthanized in accordance with approved protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec18"&gt;TIL isolation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;TIL were isolated from palpable tumours 12–14 days post tumour cell injection. Tumours were mechanically homogenized in a six-well plate and then passed through a 100 µm cell strainer, followed by a 40 µm cell strainer. The single-cell suspension was incubated with red blood cell lysis buffer for 1 min at 20–22 °C (room temperature), after which three volumes of T cell media (TCM) were added to halt the lysis reaction. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 500 RCF for 5 min at 4 °C and then resuspended in 0.5–1 ml of TCM and processed for flow cytometry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec19"&gt;Mouse T cell isolation and culture&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells were purified from mouse spleens through negative selection using magnetic bead-based isolation kits (StemCell Technologies). T cells were cultured in TCM: Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium (IMDM; Wisent) containing 10% Nu-Serum IV culture supplement (Corning), 50 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; penicillin, 50 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; streptomycin (Gibco), 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco) and 2 mM &lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;-glutamine (Gibco; final concentration 6 mM). T cells (1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells per ml) were activated in vitro by stimulation with plate-bound anti-CD3ε (clone 145-2C11; 2 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and anti-CD28 (clone 37.51; 1 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) antibodies for 48 72 h.

Mobile phase A consisted of LC–MS-grade water (W6, Fisher) with 3% LC–MS-grade methanol (A456, Fisher), mobile phase B was LC–MS-grade methanol and both mobile phases contained 10 mM tributylamine (Sigma-Aldrich, 90780), 15 mM LC–MS-grade acetic acid (Fisher, A11350) and 0.01% medronic acid (v/v; Agilent, 5191-4506).

Column temperature was kept at 35 °C, flow rate was held at 0.25 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and the chromatography gradient was as follows: 0–2.5 min held at 0% B; 2.5–7.5 min from 0% B to 20% B; 7.5–13 min from 20% B to 45% B; 13–20 min from 45% B to 99% B; and 20–24 min held at 99% B. A 16-min wash gradient was run in reverse flow direction between every injection to back-flush the column and to re-equilibrate solvent conditions as follows: 0–3 min held at 100% B and 0.25 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; 3–3.5 min held at 100% B and ramp to 0.8 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; 3.5–7.35 min held at 100% B and 0.8 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; 7.35–7.5 min held at 100% B and ramp to 0.6 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; 7.5–8.25 min from 100% B to 0% B and ramp to 0.4 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; 8.25–15.5 min held at 0% B and ramp to 0.25 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; and 15.5–16 min held at 0% B and 0.25 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. MS parameters were as follows: source voltage −2,500V; sheath gas, 60; aux gas, 19; sweep gas, 1; ion transfer tube temperature, 320 °C; and vaporizer temperature, 250 °C. Full scan data were collected using an Orbitrap with a scan range of 70–850 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; at a resolution of 240,000 and RF lens at 35%. Fragmentation was induced in the Orbitrap using assisted higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) collision energies at 15, 30 and 45%. Orbitrap resolution was 15,000, the isolation window was 2 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; and data-dependent scans were capped at five scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For acetyl-CoA measurements, samples were analysed with a Vanquish liquid chromatography system coupled to an Orbitrap ID-X (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using an H-ESI source in positive mode. A total of 2 μl of each standard and/or sample was injected and run through a 5-min reversed-phase chromatography Cortecs T3 Column (1.6 μm, 2.1 mm × 150 mm; Waters, 186008500) combined with a Cortecs T3 VanGuard Pre-column (1.6 μm, 2.1 mm × 5 mm; Waters, 186008508). Mobile phase A consisted of 100% LC–MS-grade water (Fisher, W6), 0.01% ammonium hydroxide (Fisher, A470) and 5 mM ammonium acetate (Sigma-Aldrich, 73594), and mobile phase B consisted of 99% LC–MS-grade acetonitrile (Fisher, A955). Column temperature was kept at 30 °C, flow rate was held at 0.3 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the chromatography gradient was as follows: 0–0.5 min held at 0% B; 0.5–1 min from 0% B to 10% B; 1–4 min from 10% B to 50% B; 4–4.1 min from 50% B to 99% B; and 4.1–5 min held at 99% B. A 5-min wash gradient was run between every injection to flush the column and to re-equilibrate solvent conditions as follows: 0–2 min held at 100% B; 2–3 min from 100% B to 0% B; and 3–5 min held at 0% B. MS parameters were: source voltage, 3,500 V; sheath gas, 70; aux gas, 25; sweep gas, 1; ion transfer tube temperature, 300 °C; and vaporizer temperature, 250 °C. A targeted single ion scan was performed in the Orbitrap to target acetyl-CoA and all of its carbon-13 isotopologues with a centre mass of 810.133 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; and an isolation window of 48 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;. Resolution was set at 60,000, RF lens at 60% and scan time was set for 2–4 min of the chromatographic gradient described above. Data-dependent MS2 fragmentation was induced in the Orbitrap using assisted HCD collision energies at 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100% as well as with collision-induced dissociation (CID) at a collision energy of 35%. For both MS2 fragmentations, Orbitrap resolution was 30,000, the isolation window was 1 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; for HCD and 1.5 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; for CID, and the total cycle time was 0.6 s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For βOHB quantification in serum and tumours, metabolites were extracted with a 40% acetonitrile, 40% methanol and 20% water solution. An external standard curve for βOHB was generated from 10 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; to 0.01 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; by half-log serial dilutions. Standards were processed identically to tissue and serum samples throughout the workflow. Tissues were extracted at a concentration of 40 mg tissue per ml, and serum at 40 µl serum per ml of extraction solvent. Extracts were dried and reconstituted in water (200 µl for tissue, 1 ml for serum) containing 100 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of internal standard ([U-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]-βOHB). Samples and standards were analysed on an Orbitrap Exploris 240 (Thermo) in ESI-negative mode using tributylamine ion-paired chromatography as described above. Data were processed using Skyline, and internal standard-normalized peak areas were used to calculate βOHB concentrations, which are reported in units of mg g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for tissues and mM for serum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec24"&gt;Lipidomics analyses&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipidomics samples were analysed with a Thermo Vanquish dual liquid chromatography system using two alternating methods, referred to as chromatography 1 and chromatography 2, coupled to an Orbitrap ID-X (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using an H-ESI source in positive and negative mode, respectively. A total of 2 μl of each standard and/or sample was injected, column temperatures were kept at 50 °C and the flow rate was held at 0.4 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. For both chromatography 1 and 2, mobile phase A consisted of 60% LC–MS-grade acetonitrile (Fisher Scientific, A955), 40% LC–MS grade water (Fisher Scientific, W6), 0.1% LC–MS-grade formic acid (Fisher Scientific, A117) and 10 mM ammonium formate (Fisher Scientific, 70221), and mobile phase B consisted of 90% LC–MS-grade isopropanol (Fisher Scientific, A461), 8% LC–MS-grade acetonitrile, 2% LC–MS-grade water, 0.1% LC–MS-grade formic acid and 10 mM ammonium formate. Chromatography 1 used a 30-min reversed-phase chromatography Accucore C30 column (2.6 μm, 2.1 mm × 150 mm; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 27826-152130) combined with an Accucore C30 guard column (2.6 μm, 2.1 mm × 10 mm; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 27826-012105), and the gradient was as follows: 0–1 min held at 25% B; 1–3 min from 25% B to 40% B; 3–19 min from 40% B to 75% B; 19–20.5 min 75% B to 90% B; 20.5–28 min from 90% B to 95% B; 28–28.1 min from 95% B to 100% B; and 28.1–30 min held at 100% B. A 30 min wash gradient was run between every injection (in parallel with chromatography 2) to flush the column and to re-equilibrate solvent conditions as follows: 0–2 min held at 100% B and 0.3 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; 2–2.1 min from 100% B to 25% B and held at 0.3 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; 2.1–4 min held at 25% B and ramp to 0.4 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; 4–6 min held at 25% B and ramp to 0.6 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; 6–17 min held at 25% B and 0.6 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; 17–17.1 min held at 25% B and ramp to 0.4 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; and 17.1–30 min held at 25% B and 0.4 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Chromatography 2 used a 30-min reversed-phase chromatography Acquity UPLC CSH C18 column (1.7 μm, 2.1 mm × 100 mm; Waters, 186005297) combined with a a VanGuard pre-column (1.7 μm, 2.1 mm × 5 mm; Waters, 186005303), and the gradient was as follows: 0–1 min held at 25% B; 1–3 min from 25% B to 40% B; 3–4 min from 40% B to 50% B; 4–16 min from 50% B to 65% B; 16–17 min from 65% B to 70% B; 17–25 min from 70% B to 75% B; 25–27 min from 75% B to 100% B; and 27–30 min held at 100% B. A 30-min wash gradient was run between every injection (in parallel with chromatography 1) that used the same gradient as the chromatography 1 wash gradient. For both methods, MS parameters were as follows: source voltage, +3,250 V or −3,000 V depending on method polarity; sheath gas, 40; aux gas, 10; sweep gas, 1; ion transfer tube temperature, 300 °C; and vaporizer temperature, 275 °C. Full scan data were collected using the Orbitrap with a scan range of 200-1,700 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;at a resolution of 500,000 and RF lens at 45%. Data-dependent MS2 fragmentation was induced in the Orbitrap using assisted HCD collision energies at 15, 30, 45, 75 and 110% as well as with CID at a collision energy of 35%. For both MS2 fragmentations, Orbitrap resolution was 15,000, and the isolation window was 1.5 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;. A &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; 184 mass trigger, indicative of phosphatidylcholines, was used for CID fragmentation. Data-dependent MS3 fragmentation was induced in the ion trap with the scan rate set at Rapid, using CID at a collision energy of 35%. MS3 scans were triggered by specific acyl chain losses for detailed analysis of mono-, di- and triacylglycerides. Total cycle time was 2 s. Lipid identifications were assigned using LipidSearch (v.5.0; Thermo Fisher Scientific).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For data analysis, peak picking and integration was conducted in Skyline (v.22-23) using in-house curated compound lists of accurate mass MS1 and retention time of chemical standards&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 69" title="House, R.

Red blood cells were lysed using red blood cell lysis buffer containing 0.15 M NH₄Cl, 10 mM KHCO₃ and 0.1 mM EDTA, followed by neutralization with three volumes of TCM. For cell staining, single-cell suspensions were incubated with a cocktail of fluorescently labelled antibodies and dyes as listed in the Key Resources Table. Cell viability was assessed using Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 506 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. To assess cytokine production following &lt;i&gt;Lm&lt;/i&gt;OVA infection, splenocytes collected from infected mice at 7 dpi were stimulated with 1 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; OVA&lt;sub&gt;257–264&lt;/sub&gt; peptide (Anaspec) and 50 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; IL-2 for 4 h at 37 °C. TIL were re-stimulated with PMA and ionomycin. GolgiStop protein transport inhibitor (BD Biosciences) was added at a 1:1,500 dilution during the last 2 h of incubation to block cytokine secretion. After stimulation, cells were stained with surface marker antibodies in staining buffer (PBS containing 2% FBS and 0.02% sodium azide) for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were fixed and permeabilized using the Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4 °C for 1 h. Intracellular staining was performed by incubating cells with fluorescently labelled antibodies targeting intracellular markers for either 1 h or overnight at 4 °C. Flow cytometry data were acquired using a CytoFLEX (Beckman Coulter), Aurora Cytek or BD Accuri C6 Plus cytometer. Cell sorting was performed on an Astrios (Beckman Coulter) or BD FACSAria Fusion cell sorter. Data analysis was conducted using FlowJo software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec30"&gt;CITE-seq experimental protocol&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;C57BL/6J mice aged 10–12 weeks were allocated to either AL feeding or DR for 1 week before tumour cell injection. Following the feeding regimen, each mouse was subcutaneously injected with 5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; B16-OVA melanoma cells. At 13 dpi, tumours were dissected from the mice for further analysis. To prepare single-cell suspensions, excised tumours were mechanically dissociated and filtered sequentially through 100 µm and then 50 µm cell strainers. Throughout all procedures, cells were kept on ice to preserve viability. The resulting cell suspensions were counted, and cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. To prevent nonspecific antibody binding, cells were blocked with TruStain FcX Plus (BioLegend, 156603) in Cell Staining Buffer (CSB; BD Biosciences, 420201) for 10 min at 4 °C. Each tumour sample was then labelled with a specific antibody (Hashtags 1–8, product information in Key Resource Table) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, including appropriate incubation and washing steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After hashtag labelling, cells were stained with a panel of fluorescently labelled antibodies targeting surface markers to identify live CD45⁺ leucocytes while excluding red blood cells (Ter119⁻), tumour cells (CD105⁻) and dead cells (DAPI&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). This staining facilitated the isolation of the desired cell population during flow cytometric sorting. Cells were sorted by flow cytometry, and live CD45⁺ cells were collected into tubes containing IMDM supplemented with 10% FBS. After sorting, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in CSB, and cell viability was reassessed. Based on cell counts, CD45⁺ cells were adjusted to a concentration of 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells per 50 µl and blocked again with TruStain FcX Plus for 10 min at 4 °C. During this blocking step, TotalSeq C antibodies were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions (BioLegend). The TotalSeq C antibodies were then added to the CD45⁺ cells and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C to label cell surface proteins for subsequent analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following antibody staining, cells were washed three times with CSB to remove unbound antibodies. Cells were then resuspended in 1× PBS containing 0.04% pure BSA at an approximate concentration of 2,200 cells per µl. The prepared cell suspension was used for downstream library preparation and sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec31"&gt;CITE-seq library preparation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Libraries were generated and sequenced by the VAI Genomics Core. Cells were processed with 10× Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5ʹ GEM kit (v.1.1) according to the manufacturer’s instructions to target an output of 13,000 cells per sample using a 10× Genomics Chromium Controller. In brief, single-cell suspensions in PBS + 0.04% BSA were assessed for quantity and viability on the CytoFLEX S (Beckman Coulter), then 20,000 cells per sample were loaded onto the Chromium Controller. Single cells were captured in gel beads in emulsion, where they were lysed. Released RNA was barcoded and then converted to cDNA. Using beads, cDNA was separated from the hashtag oligonucleotides (HTO), and each was used to generate adaptor-ligated libraries. Quality and quantity of the finished gene expression and HTO libraries were assessed using a combination of Agilent DNA High Sensitivity Chip (Agilent Technologies) and QuantiFluor dsDNA System (Promega). Then, 2 × 100 bp, paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer using an S2, 200-cycle sequencing kit (v.1.5) to a minimum depth of 20 K reads per cell. Base calling was done by Illumina RTA3, and output was demultiplexed and converted to FastQ format with Cell Ranger (10× Genomics, v.3.1.0).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec32"&gt;CITE-seq quality control and processing&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following library preparation, FastQ files were processed using Cell Ranger (v.7.0.1) to map and quantify expression profiles for both the transcriptome and epitopes. Single-cell 5′ paired-end sequencing chemistry was used, and the sequencing data were aligned to the mouse reference genome m10-2020-A. The resulting raw_feature_bc_matrix, containing both transcript-level and epitope quantifications, was imported into R using the Read10X function from the Seurat package (v.5.0.0). Initial data processing involved separating the gene expression (GEX) data, ADTs and HTOs, which was critical for downstream analysis. A Seurat object was created using the CreateSeuratObject function. Quality control and normalization steps were then performed: HTO data were normalized using the NormalizeData function with the method set to ‘CLR’ (centred log ratio transformation), and the HTODemux function was used to classify cells based on HTO signals into ‘singlets’, ‘doublets’ and ‘negative’ categories. Further quality control filtering was applied by retaining cells with ADT counts of at least 150, RNA counts of at least 200, an HTO classification of ‘singlet’ and mitochondrial gene expression percentage less than 20%. The GEX matrix was normalized using the SCTransform function (sctransform v.0.4.1), and ADT data were normalized using the NormalizeData function. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on both RNA and ADT data using the RunPCA function, including all ADTs for dimensionality reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To generate a joint uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) embedding that integrates both GEX and ADT data, the FindMultiModalNeighbors function was used, followed by the RunUMAP function, resulting in a weighted nearest-neighbour UMAP. Cluster identification was achieved by integrating gene expression profiles, ADT data and gene expression density visualizations using the plot_density() function from the Nebulosa package (v.1.14.0). Details of cluster identification are provided in Supplementary Tables&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01415-6#MOESM1"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01415-6#MOESM1"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Figs.&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01415-6#Fig9"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01415-6#Fig13"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;. Statistical analyses for violin plots were performed using the Kruskal–Wallis test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon comparison tests with Bonferroni &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value adjustment. Sequencing data from the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE267070"&gt;GSE267070&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec33"&gt;RNA velocity estimation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To infer cellular trajectories from the scRNA-seq data, we performed RNA velocity analysis using the Python implementation of Velocyto (v.0.17.17), following previously described methods&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 45" title="La Manno, G. et al.

In brief, spliced and unspliced counts were generated using the velocyto run10x subcommand, outputting a loom file for importing into Python or R. Next, we used scvelo to infer RNA velocity vectors and projected them onto the UMAP embeddings generated above. This approach enabled us to determine the directional changes of cells between dietary conditions.

In brief, cells were resuspended in 50 µl of lysis solution and proteins were quantified using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23227) following the vendor-supplied protocol. Plates were read at an absorbance of 562 nm using the Synergy LX Multi-Mode Reader, and Gen5 software was used for data analysis (BioTek/Agilent). Polynomial regression was used in the Gen5 software to calculate protein concentrations from a protein standard curve after an average blank absorbance subtraction. Then, 25 µg of protein per sample was reduced and alkylated at 95 °C for 10 min, and samples were digested overnight with Trypsin/Lys-C at 30 °C at a ratio of 10:1 (protein:enzyme (w/w)). Resulting peptides were cleaned with the supplied peptide clean-up columns in the EasyPep mini kit and then dried down in a Genevac SpeedVac before resuspension for instrument analysis. Samples were resuspended in 12.5 µl 0.1% formic acid (Fisher Scientific, LS118-1) and diluted 1:1 with 6 µl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Fisher Scientific, LS119-500) in autosampler vials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec36"&gt;Data-independent acquisition LC–tandem MS proteomics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data-independent acquisition analyses were performed on an Orbitrap Eclipse coupled to a Vanquish Neo system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a FAIMS Pro source (Thermo Fisher Scientific) located between the nanoESI source and the mass spectrometer. A total of 2 μg of digested peptides were separated on a nano capillary column (20 cm × 75 μm inner diameter, 365 μm outer diameter, 1.7 μm C18; CoAnn Technologies, HEB07502001718IWF) at 300 nl min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Mobile phase A consisted of LC–MS-grade H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (Fisher Scientific, LS118-500), mobile phase B consisted of 20% LC–MS-grade H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and 80% LC–MS-grade acetonitrile (Fisher Scientific, LS122500), both containing 0.1% formic acid. The LC gradient was 1% B to 24% B in 110 min; 85% B in 5 min; and 98% B for 5 min; with a total gradient length of 120 min. The column temperature was kept constant at 50 °C using a customized column heater (Phoenix S&amp;amp;T). For FAIMS, the selected compensation voltage was applied (−40 V, −55 V and −70 V) throughout the LC–MS/MS runs. Full MS spectra were collected at 120,000 resolution (full width half-maximum; FWHM), and MS2 spectra at 30,000 resolution (FWHM). Both the standard automatic gain control target and the automatic maximum injection time were selected. A precursor range of 380–985 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; was set for MS2 scans, and an isolation window of 50 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; was chosen with a 1 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; overlap for each scan cycle; 32% HCD collision energy was used for MS2 fragmentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data-independent acquisition data were processed in Spectronaut (v.19; Biognosys) using direct data-independent acquisition. Data were searched against the &lt;i&gt;Mus musculus&lt;/i&gt; proteome. The manufacturer’s default parameters were used. In brief, trypsin/P was set as the digestion enzyme, and two missed cleavages were allowed. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification, and methionine oxidation and protein amino-terminal acetylation as variable modifications. Identification was performed using a 1% &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt; value cutoff on precursor and protein levels. Both peptide precursors and protein false discovery rate (FDR) were controlled at 1%. Ion chromatograms of fragment ions were used for quantification. For each targeted ion, the area under the curve between the XIC peak boundaries was calculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec37"&gt;Proteomic data processing and GSEA&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proteomic values were imported into R from an Excel file and processed with dplyr and readxl. Replicate columns for each condition (AL-WT, AL-DKO, DR-WT, DR-DKO) were coerced to numeric and averaged to obtain per-protein means. Differential abundance was calculated as log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(fold change) (for example, DR-WT / AL-WT), and Welch’s &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests were performed between the corresponding replicate groups to obtain &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values. Proteins lacking sufficient replicate measurements were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For GSEA, proteins were mapped to gene symbols (duplicated symbols collapsed by the entry with the largest absolute log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(fold change). A pre-ranked vector was generated using the sign of the log2(fold change) multiplied by −log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value) (equivalent results were obtained using log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(fold change) alone). Mouse gene sets were retrieved from MSigDB via msigdbr (Hallmark ‘H’, curated ‘C2’ and Gene Ontology ‘C5’ collections); sets with &amp;lt;15 or &amp;gt;500 genes were discarded. Enrichment analysis was performed with fgsea (10,000 permutations, default weighting), returning normalized enrichment scores, nominal &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values and FDR-adjusted &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt; values (Benjamini–Hochberg). Only pathways with an FDR &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 were considered significant and are displayed in the figures. Bar plots of normalized enrichment scores and volcano plots were generated in ggplot2 and EnhancedVolcano, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec38"&gt;Promethion metabolic cages&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were individually housed in Promethion metabolic cages (Sable Systems International) for comprehensive metabolic phenotyping. Before data collection, animals underwent a 24 h acclimation period within the cages to minimize stress and ensure steady-state measurements. Following acclimation, continuous monitoring was performed over a desired period under controlled environmental conditions (temperature, humidity and a 12–12h light–dark cycle) as specified by the manufacturer’s guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Promethion system simultaneously recorded oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production and energy expenditure, as well as food and water intake and locomotor activity. Calibration of the sensors and verification of system performance were conducted in strict accordance with Sable Systems International’s operating protocols. Data acquisition and subsequent analysis were carried out using the proprietary Promethion analysis software, ensuring that all measurements met the company’s quality control standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec39"&gt;EchoMRI body composition analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Body composition was measured using an EchoMRI-100 on conscious mice. Before each session, the instrument was calibrated with manufacturer-provided oil standards. Individual mice were weighed, placed in a ventilated acrylic restraining tube with an internal insert to minimize movement and scanned (standard mode; water stage on–off as indicated in figure legends). Each scan yielded fat mass, lean mass, free water and total water; values were exported directly from the EchoMRI software for downstream analysis. Restraining tubes were disinfected between animals with 70% ethanol or facility-approved disinfectant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec40"&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; DAB staining quantification&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full-resolution SVS images of HDAB-stained tissue sections were imported into QuPath (v.0.5.1)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 80" title="Bankhead, P. et al.

Detections were then generated on the average channel image using the custom-trained CellPose-based model using the CellPose plugin for QuPath (v.9.0) (&lt;a href="https://github.com/BIOP/qupath-extension-cellpose"&gt;https://github.com/BIOP/qupath-extension-cellpose&lt;/a&gt;). The detections and tissue outline were exported as an object GeoJSON and imported to the original HDAB-stained image. Detection measurements were generated with QuPath’s built-in Add Intensity Features with the following settings: pixel size, 0.5 µm; region, region of interest; tile diameter, 0; channels, haematoxylin, DAB; basic features, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and median. Nuclei were then classified as positive or negative for DAB staining using the mean DAB signal at a threshold of 0.117. A pixel thresholder was used to measure the area covered by DAB staining. A training image generated from an equal number and size of random rectangles from each image was used for parameter setting. QuPath’s Create Thresholder was used with the following settings: resolution, very high (1.01 µm per pixel); channel, DAB; prefilter, Gaussian; smoothing sigma, 1; threshold, 0.25. The measure option was then run on the tissue outline to quantify the area of the tissue covered by DAB staining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec41"&gt;Statistics and data reproducibility&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data are presented as means ± s.d. for technical replicates or means ± s.e.m. for biological replicates, as indicated in figure legends. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, v.10.4.1) unless otherwise noted. Comparisons between two groups were conducted using unpaired, two-tailed Student’s &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests. For comparisons involving more than two groups, one-way or two-way ANOVA with post hoc multiple-comparison corrections (Tukey’s or Sidak’s test, as appropriate) were applied. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were compared using the log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test, with Bonferroni correction applied for multiple comparisons when indicated. Data distribution was assumed to be normal. Statistical significance was defined as &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05, with significance levels represented as *&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05, **&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01, ***&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001 and ****&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001. The statistical tests used for each dataset are specified in the corresponding figure legends when deviating from the above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications. All data were included in the analyses. In rare cases for which data were excluded, exclusion occurred because of animal health concerns (for example, sickness or tissue necrosis) or based on statistical outlier identification using standard outlier exclusion tests. Investigators were blinded to outcome assessment but not to experimental allocation during data collection. All experiments were independently repeated as described in the figure legends, and similar results were obtained, confirming reproducibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec42"&gt;Declaration of generative AI and AI-assisted technologies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the preparation of this work, the author(s) used OpenAI’s ChatGPT to review grammar, spelling and refine text style.

As a neurologist who sees the devastating consequences daily, it is evident to me that  many strokes need never have happened. Strokes  are the final event in a long, silent process—one that we now have the tools to detect, slow down, and often prevent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;Overlooked risk factor&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most overlooked contributors to stroke risk lies not in the brain, but in the neck. The carotid arteries, which carry blood to the brain, can gradually narrow due to the build-up of fatty plaques. This process is often completely symptom-free. Yet when a plaque ruptures or a clot forms, blood flow to the brain can suddenly stop, leading to irreversible paralysis, loss of speech, or even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, an important international study, the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2508800" target="_self"&gt;CREST-2 trial&lt;/a&gt;, offered new clarity on how we can better protect people at risk. The study followed more than 2,400 individuals with severe but symptom-free carotid narrowing. All participants received the best possible medical therapy—including strict control of blood pressure, cholesterol, and other vascular risks. However, the findings showed something crucial: those who also underwent carotid stenting had nearly half the risk of stroke or early death over four years compared with those treated with medicines alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that every individual with carotid disease requires an intervention. What it does reinforce, however, is that early identification of severe carotid narrowing provides an opportunity to offer additional protection to those who truly need it. Timely diagnosis makes the difference between silent risk and preventable tragedy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;Tools available&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the simplest tools available to us is the carotid Doppler ultrasound. This non-invasive test uses sound waves—without any radiation—to assess plaque build-up and measure how much the artery has narrowed. It is quick, painless, widely available, and remarkably informative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it is not recommended indiscriminately for everyone, it can be immensely useful for individuals with multiple stroke risk factors. These include high blood pressure, diabetes, elevated cholesterol levels, smoking, heart disease, peripheral artery disease, or a strong family history of vascular events. For adults above 50–55 with such risks, adding a carotid Doppler scan to an annual health check can help unearth silent but dangerous blockages long before they cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;Focusing on the basics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, no scan replaces the basics. The most effective protection against stroke continues to be disciplined control of blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes; quitting smoking; regular physical activity; and maintaining a healthy body weight. These &lt;a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/doctors-stress-need-for-healthier-lifestyles-regular-check-ups-to-prevent-strokes-in-young-adults/article68805892.ece" target="_self"&gt;lifestyle foundations&lt;/a&gt; remain our strongest defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we must &lt;a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/understanding-the-fast-rule-how-to-spot-a-stroke-in-seconds/article70215513.ece" target="_self"&gt;remember the signs&lt;/a&gt; that need urgent medical attention. Sudden weakness, facial drooping, slurred speech, vision loss, or sudden imbalance should &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; be treated as a medical emergency. These brief, transient episodes—often called warning strokes—may be the first indication of significant carotid disease and represent a narrow window to prevent something far more catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we work toward strengthening &lt;a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/india-records-18-lakh-new-brain-stroke-cases-every-year-nationwide-campaign-launched/article69834815.ece" target="_self"&gt;India’s stroke-preparedness ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;, encouraging proactive risk assessment must be a key priority. A simple neck artery scan, guided by the individual’s risk profile, can be the difference between identifying a silent threat early and discovering it only after disability strikes. Stroke prevention is not only possible—it is within reach, if we act n time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Dr. Vikram Huded is senior consultant, director, and clinical lead, interventional neurology programme, Narayana Health, Bengaluru. vikram.huded.dr@narayanahealth.org)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="articleblock-container" id="arthardpv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="update-publish-time article-published-time-end"&gt;&lt;p class="publish-time-new"&gt; Published &lt;span&gt;- December 09, 2025 03:46 pm IST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="spliter pt-0 mb-0 print-hide"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="d-none d-lg-block d-xl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="d-block d-sm-none "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Hindu</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 10:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现隐藏的大脑开关，使习惯快速形成-SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/scientists-find-a-hidden-brain-switch-that-makes-habits-form-fast/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 10:05:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPZlJEV3lJR201cVdSMEVwbFhETXkyQTdsb3czMjJfdFpNUy1rNlk4Tl9aSHlwUE9zb3NIZ25mZlc5bDBCSERYdjRwMG9jX2JuRUpXSkdjTjBEX2RMcWtTbEZDLXFTZHhlbnhobnhvaEJLMjVHSUYtbTNZbk9EcWR3aVZaQ044ei04dlRILUo3ODljOWxTOVE</guid></item><item><title>尖端的Tourette综合征治疗帮助女性重拾日常生活- TribLIVE.com</title><link>https://triblive.com/news/health-now/after-years-of-tourette-syndrome-battles-woman-finds-new-beginning-with-experimental-procedure/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storyContent"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Neurology Department at Allegheny General Hospital’s Hemlock Building, Abigail Bailey’s body folded forward in her chair.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her muscles tightened as if someone had forced the air from her lungs.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her nose burned, her chest hitched and she gripped the chair’s armrests to keep from collapsing.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abigail’s younger sister reached out and gently brushed a section of hair from her face.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I felt it kick in,” Abigail said. It was her physical reaction to her brain wirelessly connecting to the laptop sitting on the examination bed next to her Friday.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="hidden-xs"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Abigail, 24, of Hookstown in Beaver County, has lived and struggled with Tourette syndrome for more than two decades. But it wasn’t until last year — when a bladder infection led to sepsis and triggered a spike in painful motor and vocal tics — that she chose to pursue an experimental treatment.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, she underwent a two-part deep-brain stimulation procedure. Surgeons implanted a device that delivers electrical impulses to targeted areas of the brain to treat motor disorders.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was like, ‘It’s time. I don’t even care what it takes. I just want my life back. I want to be happy,’” Abigail said, remembering the constant physical pain her uncontrolled tics put her through.

&lt;p class="graybox"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="hidden-xs"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, eight months later, she is working full-time, living independently and preparing for her 2026 wedding.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spirits were high Friday as Abigail, joined by her sister Emily Bailey and her mother Colleen Bailey, visited the Allegheny Health Network hospital in Pittsburgh’s North Side. It was a routine visit to recalibrate the electrodes in her brain to help minimize the involuntary movements associated with Tourette syndrome.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurosurgical Physician Assistant Amanda Webb pointed to the different parts of Abigail’s brain they were targeting on the laptop’s screen. Everyone in the room was struck by the technology and shared memories of times when Abigail’s tics were less controlled.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the nature of their visit, everyone in the hospital room laughed and told stories to the doctors and staff.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If anybody in the world should’ve had Tourette, it was Abby — because she handled it like a pro,” said Colleen.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;‘Not curable’&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abigail, who grew up on a farm in Hookstown, was 3 years old when her parents began to notice symptoms of Tourette syndrome.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourette’s is a neurological disorder marked by sudden, repetitive, uncontrollable movements and sounds, with symptoms typically beginning between ages 5 and 10, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition can become dangerous when tics lead to accidental self-injury.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Abigail’s case, she has broken several fingers and even her ribs during severe tic episodes.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She didn’t realize until middle school how disruptive her tics had become. By high school, she was attending a modified schooling program.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her tics became an issue when she distracted her classmates and interrupted lessons.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There were points in her life when she was younger, when she was like a fish flopping on the ground,” Colleen said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I started noticing the older I got the … worse it was getting,” Abigail said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She began to feel she was reverting back to childhood as she lost control of her body.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up, Abigail spent a week each year at a camp for people with Tourette’s and their families. There, she made friends with other kids who shared her condition and heard stories of the severe bullying many of them faced.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was eye opening,” said Emily, her sister.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Abigail said she never faced bullying or cruelty from other students, many of her teachers didn’t understand her condition.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Abigail entered elementary school, Colleen met with the school board to discuss Tourette’s. She distributed handmade guidebooks explaining the condition and how to respond to it.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We did everything we could in order to learn about Tourette’s, because it was devastating for us to find out. But you know, your daughter has something that’s not curable, and as a mom, you want to solve everything, because that’s your job, and you can’t solve it. So you have to learn everything about it,” Colleen said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abigail graduated from Eastern Gateway Community College with a degree in social work, before attending Robert Morris University, in pursuit of a degree in health services administration.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;‘Everything pretty much revolved around my tics’&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2024, Abigail called her mother. She was extremely sick and scared.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She said, ‘Mom, I can’t get out of bed. I can’t do anything. I need your help,’ ” said Colleen, teary-eyed in the waiting room of the neurologist, before the Friday check-in appointment. “I didn’t know she had gotten that bad again. It was so bad she couldn’t do anything. It was horrible.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time she became ill, Abigail was living on her own and working as a case manager at a pharmaceutical company, helping people with chronic illnesses access care and develop treatment plans.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While hospitalized with sepsis, Abigail’s tics worsened drastically. She was placed on multiple different medications that left her feeling unlike herself.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She barely remembers that month,” Colleen said.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="graybox"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="hidden-xs"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Three months later, Dr. Donald Whiting performed two surgeries — one to place the electrodes in her brain and a second to connect them to a pacemaker or “battery” inside Abigail’s chest.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the brain, there’s circuits that connect to different structures in the brain that help modulate that activity and make sure that everything is moving smoothly … so by putting an electrode into one of those two areas and adjusting the electricity, we regulate that relay center,” said Whiting, chair of Allegheny Health Network’s Neuroscience Institute.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abigail is one of only a handful of patients Whiting has performed deep-brain stimulation surgery on for Tourette’s. The Bailey family came across Whiting while researching the treatment when Abigail was still in high school, but it wasn’t until she got sick that they decided to go through with it.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She was so scared, as a high schooler, of somebody operating on her brain,” Colleen said. “We researched Dr. Whiting, and we knew he was the best in the field. He’d been doing it for 20 years.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the device is approved by the Food and Drug Administration, insurance companies don’t always approve it because it is still considered experimental for Tourette syndrome, Whiting said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, Abigail’s insurance covered the procedure. With the machine’s help, which runs 24 hours a day, she is able to live her life again.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is more personal, but the coolest thing in this job is to really be able to make a difference in people’s lives, and particularly young people like her. This is really just amazing that she’s now going to have a life, to get married and live in a house, get a job.” Whiting said. “To me, that’s just what it’s all about.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abigail has been engaged to her high school sweetheart, Shane Smith, since June 2024. In August&lt;ins&gt; 2025&lt;/ins&gt;, she started a new job as a patient service representative for Heritage Valley Health System. Planning for the 2026 wedding is well underway.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everything pretty much revolved around my tics,” Abigail said. “You just have to get through it. … There’s life at the end of the tunnel, we (people with Tourette’s) just have to make it there.”

&lt;/p&gt;

A research group led by Prof. Marcus Conrad, Director of the Institute of Metabolism and Cell Death at Helmholtz Munich and Chair of Translational Redox Biology at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), has reported in Cell how nerve cells shield themselves from ferroptotic cell death.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings center on the selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which is essential for preventing this type of cell damage. A single genetic change that affects GPX4 disrupts a previously unrecognized feature of the enzyme's function. In children who inherit this mutation, the result is a severe form of early-onset dementia. When GPX4 works properly, it positions a short protein loop -- described as a "fin" -- inside the inner surface of the neuronal membrane. This allows GPX4 to neutralize lipid peroxides, harmful molecules that would otherwise damage the membrane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How a Tiny Protein "Fin" Protects Neurons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"GPX4 is a bit like a surfboard," says Conrad. "With its fin immersed into the cell membrane, it rides along the inner surface and swiftly detoxifies lipid peroxides as it goes." In children with early-onset dementia, a point mutation reshapes this fin-like loop. The altered enzyme can no longer insert itself into the membrane correctly, leaving lipid peroxides free to accumulate. When this happens, the membrane becomes vulnerable, ferroptosis is triggered, the cell ruptures, and neurons are lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research began with three children in the United States who have an extremely rare form of early childhood dementia. All three share the same alteration in the GPX4 gene, identified as the R152H mutation. Scientists used cells from one affected child and reverted them to a stem-cell-like state to investigate the mutation's effects. These stem cells were then used to grow cortical neurons and three-dimensional brain-like structures known as brain organoids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evidence From Mouse Models and Protein Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore the mutation at the level of the whole organism, the team introduced the R152H variant into a mouse model. This allowed them to modify the GPX4 enzyme in specific types of nerve cells. The mice gradually developed marked motor problems, experienced significant neuron loss in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, and showed strong neuroinflammatory responses. These findings closely matched what had been observed in the affected children and resembled patterns seen in neurodegenerative conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also examined how protein levels changed in the experimental model. They found shifts very similar to those documented in Alzheimer's disease. Many proteins that increase or decrease in Alzheimer's patients showed the same disruptions in mice without functional GPX4. This pattern indicates that ferroptotic stress may be involved not only in this rare childhood condition, but also in more common dementia-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rethinking the Origins of Dementia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our data indicate that ferroptosis can be a driving force behind neuronal death -- not just a side effect," says Dr. Svenja Lorenz, one of the first authors. "Until now, dementia research has often focused on protein deposits in the brain, so-called amyloid ß plaques. We are now putting more emphasis on the damage to cell membranes that sets this degeneration in motion in the first place."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early tests show that blocking ferroptosis can slow the cell death caused by loss of GPX4 in both cell cultures and the mouse model. "This is an important proof of principle, but it is not yet a therapy," explains Dr. Tobias Seibt, nephrologist at LMU University Hospital Munich and co-first author. According to Dr. Adam Wahida, also a first author, "In the long term, we can imagine genetic or molecular strategies to stabilize this protective system. For now, however, our work clearly remains in the realm of basic research."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Collaboration Reveals a Crucial Molecular Clue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project reflects a scientific collaboration that has expanded over many years, involving genetics, structural biology, stem cell research, and neuroscience, with contributions from several dozen researchers at institutions around the world. "It has taken us almost 14 years to link a yet-unrecognized small structural element of a single enzyme to a severe human disease," says Conrad. "Projects like this vividly demonstrate why we need long-term funding for basic research and international multidisciplinary teams if we are to truly understand complex diseases such as dementia and other neurodegenerative disease conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                Over 100 million people in the United States are estimated to have allergies each year – be they seasonal, topical, or food-related.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;More than 100 million people in the U.S. have some allergy each year. That's about every 1 in 3 adults.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For many, the fix is a bandaid: over-the-counter allergy medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But there's another treatment that works to lessen these reactions rather than just manage people's symptoms, allergy shots. The treatment has been around for over a century and is still popular today. Patients have to take the shots for a few years, and it's the closest thing science has to a cure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Host &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/people/1082526815/regina-g-barber" target="_blank"&gt;Regina G.

That’s how you lose fat, that’s how you stay full (and) lean.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;List of regular foods with low calories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adi broke down her food list into three distinct groups. The first included foods that are “high-volume, low-calorie, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/nutritionist-says-these-15-high-fiber-fruits-vegetables-and-lentils-can-help-control-hunger-and-weight-loss-naturally-101764586193271.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="high-fibre"&gt;high-fibre&lt;/a&gt;” and can keep us feeling full without significantly increasing the calorie count and derailing the weight-loss journey. Such foods include the following:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Egg whites&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greek yoghurt (0-2%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Watermelon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Berries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All leafy greens (spinach, arugula, lettuce)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hydrating veggies (cucumber, tomato, zucchini)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cruciferous veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carrots (smack them raw — also great for your teeth)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pumpkin/squash&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bone broth (big volume, almost no calories)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pickles (super filling, almost zero calories)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Air-popped popcorn (3 cups = nothing)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;List of lean proteins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proteins are the building blocks of our body and are absolutely essential for muscle growth. As such, lean proteins are an important part of the diet to stay healthy, even as we cut weight. Adi’s proteins of choice are listed as follows:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;White fish (cod, tilapia)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shrimp&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chicken breast&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turkey breast&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cottage cheese (0-2%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Edamame&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;List of carbohydrates&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While controlling the intake of carbohydrates is essential for hitting the weight loss target, the energy-rich food group is also necessary for vital functions. Foods that are rich in carbohydrates yet support fat loss as as follows:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Potatoes (one of the most filling foods on earth)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oats (huge volume when cooked with water)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rice cakes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lentils + beans (absolute health powerhouse)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole fruits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Adi highlights the benefits of the above foods, stating that they allow us to fill our tummy with big portions, provide nutrition without empty calories and thus make fat loss easier with fewer cravings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.
