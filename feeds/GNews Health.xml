Dawson&lt;/a&gt; of Florida Polytechnic University (&lt;a href="https://floridapoly.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FPU&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results point to new ways to probe small, regular structures hidden inside complex biological materials. They also hint at future light sources that work safely with living tissue for sensing and imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A biolaser is a laser that uses biological material as part of the device. It still needs a gain material, a feedback structure, and enough pump energy to cross the &lt;a href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.50.1675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lasing threshold&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here the gain came from the dye, and the feedback appears to arise from tiny structures inside the feather. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors ruled out the usual mirror based cavities and found that something within the feather acts as a resonator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-peacock-colors-are-special"&gt;Why peacock colors are special&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eyespot colors do not come from paint like pigments alone. In peacocks, a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC240659/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;photonic&lt;/a&gt; crystal of melanin rods embedded in keratin inside each barbule sets the hue by reflecting specific wavelengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those nanostructures are common across birds, and their evolution is well &lt;a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/71179" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt;. Across species, thinning melanin layers expands the palette of iridescent colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That structural heritage explains the feather’s strong color, but the new laser action needed an added dye and repeated wetting and drying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cycling likely helps the dye and solvent diffuse into the barbules and slightly loosen protein fibrils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-lasers-from-peacock-feathers"&gt;Building lasers from peacock feathers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers trimmed decorative peacock &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/chicken-embryos-reveal-secrets-of-early-feather-development/"&gt;feathers&lt;/a&gt; and mounted the eyespot region on an absorptive base. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They soaked the surface with rhodamine 6G in a water and ethanol mix, dried it, and repeated this step several times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the final cycle, they pumped the still wet sample with 532 nanometer pulses and captured the emitted spectrum. The procedure produced sharp lines only after multiple wet and dry cycles, not after a single stain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-experiments-showed"&gt;What the experiments showed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two tight peaks emerged in the yellow orange region, centered at 574 and 583 nanometers. The team saw the same wavelengths from different colored areas of the eyespot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The dye infused barbules were prepared by repeatedly wetting the eyespot with dye solution and allowing it to dry,” Dawson explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While wet, and after wet and dry cycling, across multiple parts of the same feather as well as across different &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/vulture-fossil-reveals-that-volcanic-rock-can-preserve-feathers/"&gt;feather&lt;/a&gt; samples, a highly conserved set of laser wavelengths was observed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thresholds measured for the 583 nanometer line were about 380 microjoules per square millimeter in the brown region and about 290 microjoules per square millimeter in the yellow region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The green region delivered the strongest emission relative to the broad fluorescence background. That behavior tracks the dye’s absorption and emission bands and the local structure of the feather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-different-from-random-lasers"&gt;Different from random lasers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many biological samples, lasing can occur without a well defined cavity. A random laser uses many scattering paths in a disordered medium for feedback, and its spectrum is very sensitive to small changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Random lasing in dyed human tissues has been demonstrated with diagnostic implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The system is found to emit laser light that cannot be random laser emission,” wrote Dawson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The peacock feather behaves differently. The same two wavelengths repeat across different feather regions and across samples, which is not typical of random systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7843591/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; has shown lasers from bird feathers in other ways. Parrot feathers produced random lasing when feathers and dye were sandwiched between plastic films. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new peacock result maps consistent laser modes inside the natural structure after dye infusion and cycling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-peacock-feather-laser-cavity"&gt;Peacock feather laser cavity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors did not find evidence that the color setting photonic lattice itself provides the feedback. Whispering gallery modes need round structures of a specific size, which do not appear in the barbules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They point instead to small, repeated features that form many low quality resonators with similar optical lengths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those hidden building blocks could be protein granules, dye nano crystals, or other mesoscale elements created or revealed by the stain cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/penny-sized-ultrafast-laser-could-help-self-driving-cars-see-better-measure-gravitational-waves/"&gt;laser emission&lt;/a&gt; as a probe can reveal subtle order in complex tissue. Stable spectral lines that repeat across a sample suggest recurring microstructures that are hard to spot by imaging alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of optical fingerprinting could help characterize biocompatible materials, and one day inform sensors or imaging tools that work with minimal power in living systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further work will need to identify the exact structures and understand how processing steps tune them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-04039-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 02:57:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxPV3drSGswMkpiR21lTm5MRWRFb19RaEdBSm5XcFRsVExLQVlVS3hiNm9hYy1NZTlha2l4MEdhVkVZNmd2cl9rbDlVbEpEWDcyRFA5LURzZ0Fib25UZDdwQlIxazNaWHJNV3I1dEJCSEc5c1R6RUdzTnZ4djFRaDJlOTdNYlZGMmc0bGRseTJPRQ</guid></item><item><title>周六放缓：印度有800-900万痴呆症患者，这5种大脑锻炼很重要-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/de-stress/dementia-5-brain-workouts-that-can-reduce-the-risk/photostory/126198489.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, reading is good for your brain, but only if you’re actually engaging with it. Passive reading (scrolling through headlines) doesn’t do much. Active reading, where you think, imagine, and question, is where the magic happens. It improves memory, language skills, and attention span—all areas affected early in dementia. Writing is just as powerful. Journaling, storytelling, or even writing long WhatsApp messages instead of voice notes helps your brain organise thoughts and recall memories. Word games like Scrabble, crosswords, or an occasional Sudoku also help—just don’t rely on only one type.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 01:54:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4AFBVV95cUxNSVRMSWh4SmhxdjJLMzh0SmxSak9hQXduT0ZHMDVyOTRwZ2J2dTAzV3ByZy1yQTJhSkhLRTF4V1VKdW1kS00yOGpyLXhZWkRIMzRKaVVaajdlVUl4V2JfY1loRWdrM2w4TnlJQy1zb2tlUDZlX3RtMEdYWnVCV2VGNEdKZ1Mwa04zN1p1RTlOTDFrT3NMTlB4MXRmLUpqOFh5ck8zQXRJaVhkbjFGcjVRZjlTUFFXX0JfLUJQeHBnbG5LTzJ3MkhiN2tmOHRON2h4VVU0TjJWeWdTZjZLLWVtStIB6AFBVV95cUxNMm16MC1OUDVxeW4zWTFFNS1ockN5ZmZTdjNST0hOdVdtcTl0ZVhlTWFHcG1BY0Jpdk5JbHBYY2FlbUdQOTdobzFLNXcwUENNcG5sMnlobmpqYjY4LU5hc2ZaaV9Hckh1cTlnYmdpZUFjR3d0b01jU1VramdoNjVQVTJUaUFkbXRrRXQzQkt0cWZkTC1FenJzdzFPUGNlMEdHcUFwUUJQbjJlSmp4X1NqdVU5NjI5X1hOUmEzZy1aUm5WOFdVZ3FjUW0ybVc0V1FSRElUVFltcEQ1aDBxQV9ZblE4QW5SX1Nk</guid></item><item><title>像Adderall这样的多动症药物不像医生和科学家以前认为的那样起作用- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/adhd-stimulant-medications-like-adderall-do-not-work-like-doctors-scientists-believed/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stimulant medication like Ritalin and Adderall are often given to children with ADHD. In the United States, about 3.5 million children between 3 and 17 years old take these medicines, and the number keeps growing as more children are diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people think the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/adhd-medication-lowers-risks-of-suicide-accidents-and-crime/"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt; help children pay attention better, but new research shows that this is not exactly how they work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large study from Washington University School of Medicine (&lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WashU Medicine&lt;/a&gt;) found that these medicines do not directly change the parts of the brain that control attention. Instead, the drugs make the brain feel more awake and make tasks feel more interesting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a child feels more alert and finds a task more rewarding, it becomes easier to stay with that task, even though their basic ability to focus has not changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stimulant-medications-don-t-help-focus"&gt;Stimulant medications don’t help focus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many years, clinicians and researchers believed stimulants helped children focus by strengthening brain regions responsible for attention control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Benjamin Kay, an assistant professor of neurology at WashU Medicine, noted that this view shaped his own medical training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I prescribe a lot of stimulants as a child neurologist, and I’ve always been taught that they facilitate attention systems to give people more voluntary control over what they pay attention to,” said Dr. Kay. “But we’ve shown that’s not the case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of seeing changes in attention networks, the research team observed the strongest effects in areas related to arousal and reward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These regions influence how awake the brain feels and how worthwhile an activity appears, both of which strongly affect behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-adhd-medications-change-the-brain"&gt;ADHD medications change the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how stimulants change brain activity, the researchers analyzed resting state functional MRI data from 5,795 children aged eight to eleven who participated in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study (&lt;a href="https://abcdstudy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ABCD Study&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resting state scans measure brain activity when no specific task is being performed, allowing researchers to examine underlying brain organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-plastics-chemical-bpa-linked-to-autism-adhd-in-children/"&gt;Children&lt;/a&gt; who took stimulants on the day of scanning showed increased activity in brain regions linked to wakefulness and reward. In contrast, regions classically associated with attention did not show significant changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern appeared consistently across the large dataset. Dr. Kay explained why this matters for how improvement is interpreted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rather, the improvement we observe in attention is a secondary effect of a child being more alert and finding a task more rewarding, which naturally helps them pay more attention to it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-same-effect-in-adults"&gt;Same effect in adults&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team validated these results in a controlled experiment involving five healthy adults who did not have ADHD and did not regularly take stimulant medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant underwent resting state brain scans before and after taking a dose of methylphenidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, the medication altered arousal and reward related brain networks rather than attention circuitry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This confirmation helped rule out explanations tied only to childhood development or ADHD diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-motivation-drives-improvement"&gt;Motivation drives improvement&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Essentially, we found that stimulants pre-reward our brains and allow us to keep working at things that wouldn’t normally hold our interest – like our least favorite class in school, for example,” said study senior author Dr. Nico U. Dosenbach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This increase in perceived reward helps explain why stimulant medications often improve persistence and reduce hyperactivity. Tasks that once felt unrewarding no longer trigger the urge to disengage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results also provide a potential explanation for how stimulants treat &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dog-adhd-impacts-learning-but-small-changes-can-help/"&gt;hyperactivity&lt;/a&gt;, which previously seemed paradoxical,” noted Dr. Dosenbach. “Whatever kids can’t focus on – those tasks that make them fidgety – are tasks that they find unrewarding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sleep-affects-adhd-stimulant-benefits"&gt;Sleep affects ADHD stimulant benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep emerged as a critical factor in the study. Many children in the dataset did not get the recommended nine or more hours of sleep each night. Short sleep duration was linked to poorer school grades and altered brain connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children with ADHD who took stimulant medication performed better academically than peers with ADHD who did not take stimulants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children who slept too little but took stimulants also showed better grades than sleep-deprived children who did not take medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We saw that if a participant didn’t sleep enough, but they took a stimulant, the brain signature of insufficient sleep was erased, as were the associated behavioral and cognitive decrements,” said Dr. Dosenbach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reevaluating-adhd-medications"&gt;Reevaluating ADHD medications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts emphasized that stimulants cannot replace healthy sleep. “Not getting enough sleep is always bad for you, and it’s especially bad for kids,” said Dr. Kay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that sleep deprivation can mimic ADHD symptoms, including difficulty paying attention and declining school performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, stimulant medication may appear to help by mimicking the effects of adequate sleep while leaving the long term consequences of sleep loss unaddressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest a shift in how stimulant medications should be understood. Rather than directly improving attention, these drugs increase alertness and make tasks feel more &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/autism-and-adhd-disorders-directly-linked-amount-of-time-kids-spend-on-screens/"&gt;rewarding&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That combination can improve persistence and performance, especially in children with ADHD or those who do not get enough sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By separating attention from arousal and motivation, this research offers a clearer explanation for how stimulant medications shape behavior and brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01373-X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 01:49:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxPLTNaWlpWM2F5UkNqam9MeGhhalZwcnJ6Y05QUEs3YzhJT3hQN3JPa3NRUHM2ZEZVMlNDem9rUlg2d0ZZYUV2WHlVMWVJaUpSNThNQlIyNHdnVzFwd09tVGx5RVJ4enQ3dHFtNmJyX2FmYU5ZZjZjSHRKeDJPZnpJLTdvaVF3dHhfZDQzSE9DT2lBcGNTRlctRWZNMEpWMF96amVfeUxJWVRpNXJhTGgxamVoYw</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，在减肥的同时锻炼可以保持肌肉“年轻” - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/working-out-while-losing-weight-keeps-muscles-young-study-finds</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;When we lose weight, we don't just lose body fat – we lose muscle, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can be a problem for many reasons, because skeletal muscle is far more than the tissue that helps us move. It plays a crucial role in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/2046-2395-3-9"&gt;metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;, regulating &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00033.2024"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/54.5.B207"&gt;healthy ageing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losing muscle mass is linked to reduced mobility, increased injury risk, and is thought to potentially impair long-term weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/do-fasted-workouts-really-burn-more-fat-heres-what-science-says"&gt;Do Fasted Workouts Really Burn More Fat? Here's What Science Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With millions of people now using weight loss drugs such as Wegovy and Ozempic, understanding what impact this muscle loss &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2024.6586"&gt;might have on their health&lt;/a&gt; is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loss of muscle mass is also a significant challenge for athletes, as many sports encourage them to keep body weight low while still maintaining demanding training loads and keeping their power-output high. So an energy deficit can put significant stress on an athlete's body – but to what extent it affects their normal function &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40279-024-02108-y"&gt;is unclear&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet despite these widespread implications, we still know surprisingly little about how human muscle responds at the molecular level to the combination of calorie restriction and exercise. Understanding what happens to muscle when exercising in a calorie deficit is extremely important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186718" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186718" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/medicine_ball_exercising_642.jpg" alt="man exercising with a medicine ball" class="wp-image-186718 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/medicine_ball_exercising_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/medicine_ball_exercising_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186718" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Knowing how muscles behave when calories are restricted is important for people losing weight and for athletes.

We showed that weight loss accompanied by aerobic exercise might not be that bad for the muscles after all – and indeed it may have positive effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recruited ten healthy, fit young men who completed two tightly controlled five-day experimental trials in our laboratory. During their first trial period, they consumed enough calories to maintain their body weight. But during the second, we reduced their daily calorie intake by 78 percent – a severe energy deficit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During both trials, participants completed a tightly-controlled, 90-minute low- to moderate-intensity cycling exercise three times during each five-day period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the trials, we measured blood markers such as glucose, ketones, fatty acids, and key hormones linked to energy preservation. We did this to determine if – and to what extent – the energy deficit was affecting them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also collected muscle biopsies before and after each testing period. Using an advanced method called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-9802-9_9"&gt;dynamic proteomic profiling&lt;/a&gt;, we analysed the production and abundance of hundreds of muscle proteins. This allowed us to build a detailed picture of how muscle adapts to sudden, substantial calorie restriction – even when exercise demands are maintained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the five days in an energy deficit, participants lost about 3 kg. Hormones such as leptin, T3, and IGF-1 also dropped sharply – clear signs the body was getting into an energy preservation mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But inside the muscle itself, something more unexpected was happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Muscle tissue changes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The muscle tissue mounted a strong and surprisingly positive response to the combination of exercise and calorie restriction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we saw an increase in the amount of mitochondrial proteins within the muscle, and these proteins were also being created more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria are the power generators inside cells. They convert fat and carbohydrates into usable energy. Higher amounts of mitochondrial proteins and faster production of them are hallmarks of a healthier and more efficient muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186717" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186717" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/shoulder_muscle_illo_642.jpg" alt="shoulder muscle illustration" class="wp-image-186717 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/shoulder_muscle_illo_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/shoulder_muscle_illo_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186717" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The positive changes we saw within the muscle tissue correlated with a more youthful muscle profile. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAGjWbg0p78/"&gt;Jitendra Jadhav/Getty Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also saw a clear decrease in the amount and production of collagen and collagen-related proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collagen is an abundant protein that plays a role in providing structure and strength to the muscle. However, collagen tends to accumulate in excess as we age – contributing to stiffness and impaired function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these changes resemble a shift toward a more metabolically youthful muscle profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of response has also been seen in long-term calorie-restriction &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2019.12.002"&gt;studies in monkeys&lt;/a&gt;. But this is the first time it has been demonstrated in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Healthier ageing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first glance, it seems paradoxical that the body would invest energy in maintaining or improving muscle during a time of scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muscle tissue is demanding and costly to maintain – and movement is energetically expensive, too. Shouldn't the body simply reduce muscle activity to save energy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer to this question may lie in our evolutionary past. Humans evolved as hunter-gatherers, who often faced periods of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)30573-1"&gt;low food availability&lt;/a&gt;. During those times, the ability to move efficiently – to walk and run long distances, forage or hunt – was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-024-01876-x"&gt;essential for survival&lt;/a&gt;. A body that shut down muscle function during hunger would have been less likely to survive and reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the protective response we observed may reflect deep evolutionary adaptations: muscles stay ready to move even when fuel is running low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study involved a small number of young men who were deliberately following an extreme energy deficit for a short period of time. As such, we cannot assume identical responses in women, older adults or people who are obese or have chronic health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies will need to compare weight loss with and without exercise, examine less extreme calorie deficits, include women and older adults, and measure how these molecular changes translate into actual physical performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, our findings support the idea that exercise during weight loss may protect muscle quality – and may even enhance characteristics linked to healthier ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings also have key implications for many people. People who are taking weight loss drugs or trying to lose weight may benefit from structured exercise to help them preserve muscle quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older adults, who are more vulnerable to muscle loss, may especially benefit from exercising while losing weight. Athletes may approach any energy deficit with care, but know that muscle keeps adapting to exercise stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study shows that human muscle is remarkably resilient. Even under severe stress, when much of the body is trying to conserve energy, muscle tissue seems to respond robustly – boosting its energy-producing machinery and limiting age-related degradation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, losing weight and exercising doesn't just help preserve muscle – it may help keep it younger.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268812/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new study has sparked hope in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease by demonstrating that the disease can be reversed, at least in mice. For years, Alzheimer’s has been viewed as a relentless and irreversible condition, but recent findings from researchers challenge this belief.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Restoring NAD+ Balance Could Change Alzheimer’s Treatment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease has long been considered irreversible, with most research efforts focused on slowing its progression rather than reversing its effects. However, a team of scientists from University Hospitals, Case Western Reserve University, and the &lt;strong&gt;Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center&lt;/strong&gt;, led by &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Andrew A. Pieper&lt;/strong&gt;, has discovered that the key to fighting Alzheimer’s could lie in the brain’s energy balance. Central to this balance is NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), a molecule critical for cellular energy and function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As people age, NAD+ levels naturally decline, which impairs cellular function, especially in the brain. In the case of Alzheimer’s, this decline is even more pronounced. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Reversing Alzheimer’s: A Feasible Strategy or Hopeful Fantasy?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/alzheimers-breakthrough-study-identifies-new-culprits-that-could-revolutionize-treatment/" data-type="post" data-id="70733"&gt;Alzheimer’s &lt;/a&gt;was believed to be an irreversible condition once it reached a certain point. The prevailing view in the scientific community held that once cognitive decline began, recovery was impossible. This new study, however, has upended that assumption. Using animal models with both amyloid and tau-related mutations, which mirror human &lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s pathology&lt;/strong&gt;, the researchers showed that by restoring NAD+ balance, they could repair extensive brain damage and fully restore cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We were very excited and encouraged by our results,” said&lt;strong&gt; Dr. Pieper&lt;/strong&gt;, the senior author of the study. “Restoring the brain’s energy balance achieved pathological and functional recovery in both lines of mice with advanced Alzheimer’s. Seeing this effect in two very different animal models, each driven by different genetic causes, strengthens the idea that restoring the brain’s NAD+ balance might help patients recover from Alzheimer’s.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This discovery offers a new perspective, suggesting that Alzheimer’s therapy may not only be about slowing the disease’s progress but also potentially recovering lost brain function. If this strategy proves successful in humans, it could lead to a paradigm shift in Alzheimer’s treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Mechanism Behind Alzheimer’s Reversal: NAD+ and Brain Health&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.uhhospitals.org/news-releases/articles/2025/12/study-shows-alzheimers-disease-can-be-reversed-in-animal-models" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, revolve around a critical molecule in the body: &lt;strong&gt;NAD+.&lt;/strong&gt; This molecule plays an essential role in maintaining cellular function, particularly in the brain. NAD+ is involved in cellular metabolism, DNA repair, and overall cellular health. As we age, &lt;strong&gt;NAD+ levels &lt;/strong&gt;decline, and this process accelerates in those with Alzheimer’s. The researchers found that the inability of the brain to maintain proper NAD+ levels is a major factor driving Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors used a pharmacological compound, &lt;strong&gt;P7C3-A20, to restore NAD+ balance&lt;/strong&gt; in the brains of &lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s mice&lt;/strong&gt;. This compound did not just slow the disease’s progression; it reversed existing damage and restored cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Beyond Alzheimer’s: What This Could Mean for Other Neurodegenerative Diseases&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implications of this discovery extend far beyond &lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;. Other age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s and Huntington’s, also involve a decline in brain function and cellular energy balance. The findings from this study suggest that restoring &lt;strong&gt;NAD+ balance&lt;/strong&gt; could have a broader application for treating chronic, age-related neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Pieper&lt;/strong&gt; emphasized the need for further research to explore this approach in other conditions. “This new therapeutic approach to recovery needs to be moved into carefully designed human clinical trials to determine whether the efficacy seen in animal models translates to human patients,” he explained. “Additional next steps for the laboratory research include pinpointing which aspects of brain energy balance are most important for recovery, identifying and evaluating complementary approaches to Alzheimer’s reversal, and investigating whether this recovery approach is also effective in other forms of chronic, age-related neurodegenerative disease.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Breakthrough for Alzheimer’s: Clinical Trials Are the Next Step&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The promising results from this research have sparked a renewed sense of optimism in the fight against Alzheimer’s. However,&lt;strong&gt; Dr. Pieper and his colleagues&lt;/strong&gt; caution that while these results are promising, they must be confirmed in human clinical trials before any potential treatments can be widely recommended. The team is actively working toward moving their findings from animal models to human trials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The hope is that this research will lead to new therapies that not only slow Alzheimer’s progression but also offer a genuine chance of recovery. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is important when considering patient care, and clinicians should consider the possibility that therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring brain energy balance might offer a path to disease recovery,” said Dr. Pieper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As this research progresses, it opens new avenues for Alzheimer’s treatment, offering fresh hope to patients and their families.&lt;/p&gt;

(WIS) - Prisma Health announced it will temporarily restrict children’s visits to hospitalized patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Prisma Health said this is due to increased rates of community influenza and other respiratory illnesses. Prisma Health will restrict anyone 15 and younger from visiting hospitalized patients as of Tuesday, Dec. 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“By taking this proactive step, we can help ensure our hospitals remain safe places for our patients to receive high-quality care,” said Jacie Volkman, executive director of Prisma Health’s Department of Infection Prevention. Exceptions may be allowed for circumstances such as the imminent death of a loved one, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Visitors who feel sick should not visit their hospitalized loved ones. Prisma Health recommends that all visitors wear masks to help avoid the spread of respiratory illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there have been at least 1,900 deaths from the flu so far this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends everyone 6 months and older get vaccinated against the flu.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We asked &lt;a href="https://baptisthealth.net/doctors/harneet-kaur-walia/1787990" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Harneet Walia, MD&lt;/a&gt;, the medical director of sleep at the Miami Cardiac and Vascular Institute, to find out.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Q: Are magnesium supplements safe to take with other common sleep aids such as Unisom, Benadryl, or NyQuil? What about melatonin?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Walia: &lt;/strong&gt;Using several sedating products together can cause more drowsiness, dizziness, or tiredness the next day. This can be dangerous, especially when you're driving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Medications like Unisom, Benadryl, and NyQuil have antihistamines, and they're already quite sedating, so taking them with magnesium could strengthen these effects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While some supplements contain both &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/can-you-take-magnesium-and-melatonin-together-11766896" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium and melatonin&lt;/a&gt;, research is lacking on their combined effectiveness. It is also possible that combining them could lead to side effects such as increased drowsiness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It's safest to use just &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-to-take-when-you-cant-sleep-3015261" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;one sleep aid at a time&lt;/a&gt;. Start with the lowest dose that works, and avoid mixing different products unless a healthcare provider recommends it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-should-i-stick-to-magnesium-on-its-own"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Should I Stick to Magnesium On Its Own? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/magnesium-vs-melatonin-11838501" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;limited evidence that magnesium helps&lt;/a&gt; with sleep; only a few small studies have shown any benefit.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While most people can use &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/is-it-safe-to-take-magnesium-without-a-deficiency-11831803" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;magnesium safely&lt;/a&gt;, it's not entirely without risks. Magnesium supplement isn't regulated by the FDA, and it can make the sedative effects of other substances stronger.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High doses may cause an upset stomach or diarrhea and may interact with certain medications. People with kidney or liver issues, or those on drugs affecting magnesium levels, should be cautious.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It's best to consult your doctor before adding magnesium to your routine.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Rather than simply adding more supplements or medications, addressing the underlying causes of poor sleep is crucial.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Healthy sleep habits, such as keeping a regular schedule, minimizing evening screen time, and following a relaxing bedtime routine, are the key to better sleep. It is essential to know that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-for-insomnia-cbti-3015310" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy for sleep&lt;/a&gt; is the mainstay of treatment for someone with insomnia.

					&lt;p&gt;A discovery by Prof. Ami Aronheim and his team at the Technion–Israel Institute of Technology shows that the growth of cancerous tumors may actually combat cardiac dysfunction and reduce fibrosis, the scarring process that stiffens the heart muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The failing heart can beat much better in the presence of cancer cells or a tumor,” said lead investigator Aronheim, dean of the Technion’s Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, speaking to The Times of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is very surprising,” Aronheim said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Currently, no drugs exist that can reverse fibrosis or improve the heart muscle once it has been damaged, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings could open the door to the development of innovative and groundbreaking therapeutic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="timesofisrael" data-from="In surprising breakthrough, scientists in Israel find cancer may help heal the failing heart"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PhD students Lama Awwad and Laris Achlaug led the research, which was recently &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666087325001607"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in JACC: CardioOncology, a peer-reviewed journal of the American College of Cardiology.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heart disease and cancer are the two most significant causes of death in Israel, according to the Health Ministry. While they have been considered separate diseases, researchers now confirm that they are highly connected — and they affect each other’s outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diseases also share similar risk factors, including smoking, obesity, diabetes, environmental factors and aging.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;“These are two diseases that are all around us, and that people we know suffer from,” Awwad, 28, told The Times of Israel in a recent Zoom interview together with Achlaug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Awwad said, the two conditions share similar mechanisms, which involve inflammation, growth signals, and survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Heart disease is a cancer-spreader&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772976125002120"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; conducted by Aronheim’s lab five years ago, the scientific team found that a stressed heart can actually accelerate the growth and spread of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we first looked at how heart failure affects cancer, we showed that a damaged heart can make the cancer more aggressive and more metastatic,” Aronheim said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can happen because cytokines, chemical messengers that immune cells use to communicate with one another, are released by the heart. These cytokines promote the growth and spread of cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while doing these experiments, the researchers noticed an unexpected — and inverse — result. In tumor-bearing mice, heart failure was “much less pronounced.”&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;“This led us to start to think about studying the other direction, how cancer affects heart failure,” Aronheim said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists implanted cancer cells in mice with heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised to find an improvement not only in the ability of the mice’s hearts to pump blood but also an improvement in the muscular system,” said Achlaug, 31. “It was very motivating.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were surprised to find an improvement not only in the ability of the mice’s hearts to pump blood but also an improvement in the muscular system&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the extent of fibrotic, or scarred, tissue was significantly decreased in a short period of time.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was a breakthrough for us,” Aronheim said. “Of course, it was clear to us that it’s not a possible treatment to use another disease for the sake of repairing heart dysfunction. So we had to study the mechanism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers hypothesized that exposing immune cells to cancer cells can yield a process called “immunomodulation,” which enables the immune system to regenerate and begin fighting inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test their hypothesis, the scientists injected serum extracted from the blood of the tumor-bearing mice into heart-diseased mice. These mice exhibited rapid improvements in cardiac function and reduced fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        

	&lt;figure id="attachment_2877553" class="wp-caption  alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2022/11/iStock-990873330.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-2877553" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2022/11/iStock-990873330-640x400.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;3D Illustration of Human Heart Anatomy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed the molecules in the serum and found that the cytokines were released from natural killer cells, also known as NK cells. These are a type of immune cell that attacks foreign cells when activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cytokines activated macrophages, a type of white blood cell that plays a crucial role in consuming pathogens. The cytokines helped reprogram the macrophages into anti-inflammatory, healing-focused cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work of Aronheim’s lab has shed light on the common biological pathways between cancer and heart disease, said Izhak Kehat, head of the department of physiology, biophysics, and systems biology, in the Technion’s Faculty of Medicine, who was not involved in the project.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3717045" class="wp-caption size-fullscreen alignright"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/izhak.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-3717045 size-full" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/izhak.jpeg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Tumors can release signals that affect the whole body’s repair and immune response,” Kehat said. “And some of these signals can be harnessed to improve heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awwad said the research team has a patent on the serum with “a cocktail of positive factors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have to test its toxicity and prove that it’s safe to use,” Achlaug explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Breaking down social — and scientific — barriers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awwad, who lives in Tamra, an Arab town in the Galilee, and Achlaug, who lives in Kfar Kama, a Circassian town 60 kilometers (37 miles) away, spoke about their challenges as researchers and as mothers of small children.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;They credited their husbands, who are both engineers (Awwad’s husband works at Google and Achlaug’s husband works at Apple), and “who can sometimes work from home during the week,” Achlaug said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And also when we take our work home on weekends,” Awwad added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She noted that approximately 50 percent of the Technion’s graduate students are women, and about 50% of those are Arabs. However, she said there are few female researchers because of the “long hours we spend in the lab.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Circassian community, which numbers 5,000 in Israel, Achlaug said there are only two other women who have PhDs.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they attend scientific conferences abroad, Awwad said that people are less curious about them as women and more interested in their lives as Arabs in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People ask me a lot of questions about ‘what’s really happening,'” Awwad said. “It’s good because I like to calm them down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achlaug said they never encountered hostility at conferences, but she was “a little nervous” when presenting her paper to a group of scientists from Beirut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But there’s a sense of honor among researchers to focus on science,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then, afterwards,” Awwad said, “they can have their opinions.”&lt;/p&gt;

Nathan Weidman's life was forever changed after a routine cough led to artery damage that triggered a double stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNIONTOWN, Ohio — A routine morning in April turned into a life-changing event for &lt;a href="/local"&gt;Uniontown&lt;/a&gt; police lieutenant and Army veteran Nathan Weidman. What began as a simple cold escalated into a medical emergency that left the 44-year-old unable to walk or speak, and facing a long road to recovery.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So on April 2nd, I woke up in the middle of the night getting ready for work and I realized that I had slurred speech and I couldn't use the left side of my body, so I went to look in the mirror and I could see face droop,” Weidman recalled.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A coughing spell had torn an artery in his neck, sending a clot to his brain and triggering a double stroke.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wasn't able to walk when I was in the ICU," said Weidman. "Then getting into the physical therapy, they worked me through getting to baby stages of walking and now I can walk pretty decent, but there's still a lot of deficits. I can't really use my left arm much at all."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weidman credits functional electrical stimulation technology with helping him to regain some movement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The way that it works is it stimulates the nerves in either your arm or your leg to elicit a muscle contraction… for your arm to open or close the hand," explained Rob Meier, a physical therapist and Clinical Territory Manager for &lt;a href="https://bionessmobility.com/dtcinquiries/"&gt;Bioness&lt;/a&gt;. He has worked with Weidman.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weidman said his family, community, and support system have been a key part of helping him push forward.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People I’ve never met come out of the woodwork, do great things for us," said Weidman. "It's helped me get through everything, knowing that I'm not alone."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weidman continues physical therapy with the goal of returning to the police force. He also wants his experience to raise awareness about strokes and the importance of early recognition.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Below are possible signs of strokes according to the American Stroke Association:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Stroke Association recommends remembering &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org/en/about-stroke/stroke-symptoms"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F.A.S.T. warning signs&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F – Face Drooping:&lt;/strong&gt; Does one side of the face droop or is it numb? Ask the person to smile. Is the smile uneven?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A – Arm Weakness:&lt;/strong&gt; Is one arm weak or numb? Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downward?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S – Speech Difficulty:&lt;/strong&gt; Is speech slurred?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T – Time to Call 911:&lt;/strong&gt; Stroke is a medical emergency.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other sudden stroke symptoms include:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Confusion, trouble speaking, or understanding speech&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trouble seeing in one or both eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Severe headache&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

'[It was] terrifying. It honestly did not feel real. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I have the worst hypochondria, so when I read the diagnosis in my portal it was really scary.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rachel Christensen (pictured here), 24, was diagnosed with thyroid cancer last year after mistaking her symptoms for exhaustion from a busy lifestyle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Christensen is one of a growing number of young Americans diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Recent estimates found the disease spiked 240 percent between 1973 and 2002 in all age groups overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, a 2025 study found incidence in children, adolescents and young adults ages 15 to 39 in the US surged 137 percent from 1995 to 2014. The highest rate of increase in the study was for PTC, which increased 5.5 percent per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts believe environmental contaminants like microplastics and pollution, along with growing rates of obesity, could be to blame for the surge, though scans to detect the disease have also become more common. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates 44,000 new cases of thyroid cancer have been detected in 2025, and 2,300 Americans have died. About 80 percent of thyroid cancers are PTC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease is almost three times more common in women, which could be because the female sex hormone estrogen is thought to stimulate the growth of thyroid cancer cells.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in the neck that produces hormones responsible for regulating the body's temperature, energy use, heart rate, digestive health and skin, hair and nail growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like Christensen, most PTC patients have a painless lump near the thyroid gland but have few or no other symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The overall five-year survival rate for thyroid cancer is 99 percent. In cases like Christensen's where the disease has spread to other areas, that rate is about 71 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Christensen, pictured here with her mother, had to have her entire thyroid removed to treat her cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Christensen, pictured here after surgery, now has to take hormone therapy to replace hormone levels lost from her thyroidectomy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Less than a month after hearing the life-changing diagnosis, Christensen faced a major five-hour surgery to remove her thyroid and the affected lymph nodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I honestly just wanted to get it over with,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Seeing my scar for the first time was definitely scary as well,' she added. 'It’s about two to three inches long on my neck and all I could think about is how it would heal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now I don’t even care if you can see it. It reminds me of my strength.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The operation was a success with surgeons removing her thyroid and all traces of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Christensen is now considered cancer-free following the surgery, but she was faced with a daunting new reality: living without a thyroid to produce vital hormones necessary for regulating metabolism, energy, body temperature and heart function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People without a thyroid gland are forced to take hormone replacement therapy to ensure they get adequate levels of the hormone synthetic thyroxine (T4). Without this, patients can suffer from fatigue, dry skin, brittle hair and nails, irregular periods and a slow heart rate, among other issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Left uncontrolled, low thyroid hormones can lead to high cholesterol, heart failure, infertility, depression and cognitive decline.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Christensen, pictured here, is now working to raise awareness of thyroid cancer warning signs for other young people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Christensen said: 'My body is constantly fluctuating, so listening to my body is very important. It has been super frustrating both physically and mentally, so I try to give myself some grace and more credit for what I have been through at such a young age.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the ordeal, she says she is healthier now than when she was first diagnosed. She wakes up at 6am each day and has bloodwork every few weeks to manage her thyroid levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is also working with a naturopathic doctor to evaluate her diet and focus on her microbiome, a network of healthy bacteria living in the gut that influences digestion, immune health and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Christensen also credits her family for being her 'biggest support system.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'My mom is my biggest advocate and still to this day. [She] helps me navigate this and researches so that I can get to feeling my best.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now that she is cancer free, Christensen has also begun posting about her story on social media to help raise awareness for other young people who may dismiss the warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I am finally learning to give myself more grace and credit because living with this is very hard,' she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 17:25:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPTWZtc2NZdzJqbTljU2ZMaEpmYkFvXzRWVTVtZzBlNmc2Nzh2Z181c0JRS2IwM3d1X1E2M1ZVLTd6a1J1Z2E3Q0JMLVhnOEEtdWU5dTdmZ1F6RVZ1cERQQ0R6WW1fOVpDRVRsZl9qczJtVmlROW1ZSjltOUJvclJsUWxVVHhlWC1UMkpxUXJmTE5keXFYRHVxenZXRUNVczjSAaQBQVVfeXFMTXlLTzBHRVRocjBuV3hUcEtlOEwwMzNRUldDeDZ4ZzAtMzZqUnk0Z0NVTFRUQ2Rtd3hYMmlZeXFNOWhPeWM4Q3V6aTR5U0VWTmFDeFpaclFGQ2dIbVZ1eHFENEgtemNvc2xUTXFoLU9iZVlXNzhNZnNBOWpPVnBkVmlZX2hScTNTY1ZPcGpFMlR6WnE0ZHJVN2xFTGhZRWtlWWVDX1o</guid></item><item><title>年轻人的结肠癌发病率正在飙升。以下是原因，以及如何降低风险-达拉斯新闻</title><link>https://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/2025/12/26/colon-cancer-rates-are-spiking-among-young-people-heres-why-and-how-to-lower-your-risk/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Dr. Bethany Malone has treated a lot of colorectal cancer patients.

Her experience in North Texas reflects a worldwide trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Colorectal cancer — which includes cancer of the colon and of the rectum — is considered early onset when diagnosed in people under the age of 50. While the majority of diagnoses are still among people aged 65 or older, early onset rates have been increasing worldwide, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7994182/" rel=""&gt;particularly in high-income countries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;In a 2023 report, the American Cancer Society wrote that the trends of decreasing incidence in older people and increasing incidence in younger people are “&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures-2023.pdf" rel=""&gt;rapidly shifting the patient population younger&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;In 2020, &lt;i&gt;Black Panther&lt;/i&gt; actor Chadwick Boseman died from colon cancer at age 43. More recently, former Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders choreographer Criscilla Anderson &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/arts-entertainment/pop-culture/2025/12/04/former-cowboys-cheerleaders-choreographer-criscilla-anderson-dies-after-cancer-battle/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/arts-entertainment/pop-culture/2025/12/04/former-cowboys-cheerleaders-choreographer-criscilla-anderson-dies-after-cancer-battle/"&gt;died of colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; at age 45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Also locally, &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/arts-entertainment/2024/12/26/joshua-ray-walker-on-fighting-cancer-and-rallying-back/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/arts-entertainment/2024/12/26/joshua-ray-walker-on-fighting-cancer-and-rallying-back/"&gt;Dallas musician Joshua Ray Walker&lt;/a&gt; was diagnosed with colon cancer in late 2023, at age 33. (About 10 months later, after treatment and surgery, he announced that he was &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/joshuaraywalkermusic/posts/pfbid027McWfGGqiwUYkxeMXdG9h8HB9H4QxtjAouLUKvhgytUkd8PAd9SnRw63sT1EEpJNl" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.facebook.com/joshuaraywalkermusic/posts/pfbid027McWfGGqiwUYkxeMXdG9h8HB9H4QxtjAouLUKvhgytUkd8PAd9SnRw63sT1EEpJNl"&gt;cancer-free&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Here’s what medical experts say about the rising rates of colorectal cancer in younger people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-text-header"&gt;Why are colorectal cancer rates rising among younger people?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Medical experts say there isn’t one reason why colorectal cancer rates are rising in the below-50 age groups. But there are some contributing factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;First, it’s not because of genetics. Dr. Radhika Kainthla, a medical oncologist at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, said that about 20% of early onset colorectal cancer patients have a genetic tie-in. That means 80% do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“There’s a misconception a lot of times that if it’s a young person being diagnosed with cancer, it must be genetic,” Kainthla said. “But that’s not actually what we’re seeing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;All three experts who spoke with &lt;i&gt;The Dallas Morning News&lt;/i&gt; pointed instead to a combination of environmental factors and lifestyle factors, such as diets high in red meat, diets packed with ultra-processed foods and lack of regular exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Malone at Texas Health Fort Worth said fiber intake especially tends to be low for Americans, which can increase the risk for colorectal cancer. Fiber does a lot of work in the gut, Malone said, including feeding a healthy microbiome and helping to flush carcinogens out of the body before they’re absorbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Malone noted that the “lifestyle” factors are not always easily controllable. The U.S. food system has shifted significantly toward ultra-processed foods, which tend to be low in necessary nutrients such as fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;There are also environmental factors at play, said Dr. Emina Huang, a professor of surgery and a colorectal surgeon at UT Southwestern Medical Center. For instance, living near a superfund site — which are hazardous waste sites — has been shown to increase the risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-text-header"&gt;How can I reduce my risk of colorectal cancer?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Reducing the risk of colorectal cancer, the three experts said, comes down to a lot of the standard advice that medical professionals recommend for general health, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The three experts said that folks should focus on getting regular exercise, avoiding smoking, moderating alcohol intake and eating a diet that’s low in red meat but rich in fruits, vegetables and fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Obesity is also a risk factor for colorectal cancer, the experts said, although Malone cautioned against focusing on weight loss alone. Restrictive diets may also end up being low in fiber, which is harmful rather than helpful for colorectal cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;And, of course, patients should pay attention to their bodies and seek medical care if they notice abdominal pain or changes in their bowel movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-text-header"&gt;When should I start getting screened for colorectal cancer?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Because of the rising rates of colorectal cancer among younger people, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force advises regular screenings beginning at age 45. The gold standard of screening is a colonoscopy, but stool tests and scans can also be used for screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The age 45 recommendation, however, is for patients who have a standard risk for colorectal cancer. Some people may be at higher risk due to personal or family history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;People with a first-degree relative — a sibling, parent or child — diagnosed with colorectal cancer or colorectal polyps may be advised to begin screenings at a younger age. In general, medical professionals advise beginning screening when a patient is 10 years younger than their relative was at the age of diagnosis. For instance, if your father was diagnosed with colorectal cancer at age 48, you should begin screenings at age 38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Patients with such a family history should start screenings no later than 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Similarly, patients who have personal histories of Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis are at higher risk of colorectal cancer, too, and should also begin screenings at an earlier age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Kainthla, at Parkland, also noted that there are other types of screenings besides colonoscopies, such as blood tests and stool tests, that may be a useful option for some patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-text-header"&gt;What are the warning signs of colorectal cancer?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Medical experts are quick to point out that, for most young people, abdominal or gastrointestinal symptoms are unlikely to indicate colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Still, some symptoms should serve as red flags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The most common early symptoms are stomach pain that doesn’t go away, changes in bowel movements with no improvement or blood in the stool. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Sometimes, these symptoms can indicate hemorrhoids or other relatively benign conditions. However, if a patient is treated for a benign condition but symptoms do not improve, that’s a sign that something more may be going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__bZ-w3 py-5 px-7 border border-gray-light my-8 clear-both"&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__mrnG- w_full py-5 border-t border-gray-light flex"&gt;&lt;a class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__P4zn3 inline-block pr-8 shrink-0 w-auto flex flex-col" href="/news/investigations/2025/12/26/what-researchers-have-discovered-about-maternal-infant-health-under-texas-abortion-laws/"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__6H-hI dmnc_images-modern-image-module__QFaG- max-w-full h-auto text-white dmnc_images-modern-image-module__9Zlll bg-gray-light object-contain" src="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/QGTTZXLTDZC57GLYYYR77HJ3IQ.jpg?auth=2d275643f203ee73d6499b4ef0bc365b25266f17ac91f92a0f151940324b5b05&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;height=127&amp;amp;width=190&amp;amp;smart=true" alt="Abortion rights supporters and opponents clash while demonstrating in downtown Dallas on..."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__DfYNg inline-block w-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__T453o mt-2 w-full break-normal text-gray-dark secondaryRoman secondaryRoman-15"&gt;In the four years since Texas introduced abortion bans, researchers have identified negative health impacts for mothers and babies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__mrnG- w_full py-5 border-t border-gray-light flex"&gt;&lt;a class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__P4zn3 inline-block pr-8 shrink-0 w-auto flex flex-col" href="/news/public-health/2025/12/25/food-storage-holidays/"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__6H-hI dmnc_images-modern-image-module__QFaG- max-w-full h-auto text-white dmnc_images-modern-image-module__9Zlll bg-gray-light object-contain" src="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/UMOHTTBNKRDU3ATYEGO7RXD5BE.jpg?auth=891deac63192cacedb533c73ea10fb11f3b59917ddcd7ccec11d7517f102b1a9&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;height=127&amp;amp;width=190&amp;amp;smart=true" alt="Bananas and various products seen on the shelf of Catholic Charities Dallas and North Texas..."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__DfYNg inline-block w-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-subject-tag-list-with-images-list-with-images-module__T453o mt-2 w-full break-normal text-gray-dark secondaryRoman secondaryRoman-15"&gt;Proper storage can extend food life, preserve nutrients, and help families save money, experts say&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Dallas News</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 17:02:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi3wFBVV95cUxPRE9RSlRNX3VxU0ZTZEZEUGs5OFg5WlNTdHk1R3B0NTItbnNhNVlPWEJ5QlRLdFNQRENpV2lkcXNqa3FVczRsbGgtUFZjVVphb1dvZGFzamZNM29hUDQwVkxBVlBPeF8tcmhPSWQzQ3V1MktsRXlPUWF0akxBRFAwU2pTVHVlc2tVeHdELUFKc2RNYTlJaEZUVEY3UXN3T3Z2MUQ5SlRxVnlCNDhKVS04LUM3SVYtTzBCcVZvU3h3aGRyOENnSEdrWkhDTHQxZVpLa3pmX09MWDNCckFBWGhN</guid></item><item><title>甲型流感在德克萨斯州中部蔓延- KWTX</title><link>https://www.kwtx.com/2025/12/26/flu-spreading-central-texas/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;figure class="media-item | figure media-item-image article-image w-100"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption mt-1 px-1"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Baylor Scott &amp;amp;

White.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Health officials are tracking a new strain this season — flu A (H1N1) across Central Texas — which is producing symptoms similar to other strains but with some notable additions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Just the typical symptoms of the fever which can be high 103° or 104° in some people, most people it’s a low grade fever; sore throat, runny nose, but then also there’s this whole throwing up and diarrhea that comes with flu A as well that we’re seeing in a certain amount of people," Dr. Wehmeyer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Flu vaccines remain the best defense - however the shot isn’t a perfect match for the new strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“If you’re 65 and older that vaccine can decrease serious illness.

Even though viewer @terryconklin1 warned, "This is actually really dangerous because the cat could discover glow sticks and start going to EDM festivals," Honnas Vet knows it's too late for this party kitty. In their own words: "He craves the rave."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Do Orange Cats Need More Medication?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many people with naturally red hair require more anesthesia or sedation during medical procedures, but what about orange cats? As it turns out, the MC1R gene that is responsible for giving humans red hair is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/gene-behind-orange-fur-cats-found-last" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:same gene;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;same gene&lt;/a&gt; that gives orange cats their fiery fur color, so their anesthesia response is likely not related to their red fur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When a commenter asked a similar question, Honnas Veterinary answered, "It depends on the kitty. Crowley requires pretty heavy sedation for us to be able to do his scans," but this isn't the case for every &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/unbothered-orange-cat-lives-bear-224500922.html" data-ylk="slk:ginger cat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;ginger cat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even though coat color doesn't affect a cat's reaction to anesthesia, other factors, like energy level and fear, certainly can. Whether it's sedation for a surgery or for a short scan like Crowley's, medication is the safest choice for many cats—and for the vet staff who care for them!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/dog-face" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐶;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🐶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/parade-pets" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SIGN UP to get “pawsitivity” delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP to get “pawsitivity” delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/paw-prints" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐾🐾;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🐾🐾&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally published by &lt;a href="https://pethelpful.com/pet-news/orange-cats-priceless-response-to-anesthesia-medication" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PetHelpful;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PetHelpful&lt;/a&gt; on Dec 26, 2025, where it first appeared in the &lt;a href="https://pethelpful.com/pet-news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pet News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Pet News&lt;/a&gt; section.

With her second birthday eight days away, the family was counting down as they often did, asking Alexa how many days were left and capturing the joy that followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Larkin remembers pulling out her phone because her daughter’s excitement felt like something worth saving. Instead of the smile she expected, her daughter began scratching her neck and asking to be picked up, behavior that initially didn’t set off alarms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“She has eczema, so that’s nothing out of the ordinary, and that’s why it kind of took me a little bit to catch on,” Larkin explains. It wasn’t until she picked her daughter up and saw her from a different angle that the truth became clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;From that new lighting, the hives were suddenly visible, spreading across her daughter’s skin. “As soon as I picked her up, I saw the hives, and I was like, oh, she’s having an allergic reaction,” Larkin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Because food allergies were already part of their daily life, Larkin knew exactly what to do next. She gave her daughter Zyrtec, and the reaction subsided without escalating further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simmy Larkin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simmy Larkin's daughter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At the time, Larkin didn’t realize apples were the trigger, let alone something as specific as the peel. Like many parents watching the video later, she initially assumed the reaction could have been caused by something else in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“She has broken out into random hives before, and I did not have any explanation why,” Larkin says. Later testing revealed allergies to dogs and dust, things that had been affecting her daughter without the family fully understanding the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The family dog, for instance, had unknowingly been a trigger. “Whenever he licks her, she breaks out in hives, and we didn’t know that,” Larkin says, explaining why the apple peel didn’t immediately register as the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It wasn’t until a second reaction, this time off camera, that the pattern became impossible to ignore. After giving her daughter another apple with the peel on, the same symptoms appeared, prompting Larkin to contact her allergist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“That second time is when I realized that, oh, she must be allergic to the apple peel,” she says. From there, more testing followed, and the list of allergens continued to grow. Now her daughter's list of allergens now contains common foods like steak and eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Beef was one of the earliest and most surprising discoveries. “I’ve never heard of anyone ever being allergic to steak, so that situation was like, wow, she’s got a rare allergy,” Larkin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The apple peel diagnosis only deepened her awareness of how unpredictable allergies can be. “I’ve never even heard of an apple peel allergy, like that’s why I didn’t catch on the first time,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Since sharing the video on TikTok, Larkin has heard from countless viewers with similar stories. Many told her they developed the same allergy later in life, after years of eating apples without any issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“A lot of people commented and said they grew up eating apple peels, and then as an adult they started to react,” Larkin says. Reading those stories only reinforced how vigilant she now feels she has to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Today, that vigilance shapes nearly every part of their routine. Meals are adjusted, ingredients are swapped and familiar foods are approached with caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We substitute ground turkey for a lot of beef recipes, even though I don’t like the taste of it,” Larkin says, laughing. She adds that the family now eats far less red meat overall, something she views as a small silver lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simmy Larkin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simmy, her husband, and two daughters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Social situations require even more planning. At birthday parties or cookouts, Larkin often brings her daughter’s food rather than risk cross-contamination on shared grills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At school, the differences are especially emotional. “I feel bad knowing that she can’t have cupcakes,” Larkin says, explaining how her daughter’s teacher keeps candy bars on hand so she still gets a treat during celebrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Despite her own worries, Larkin believes her daughter has adapted better than she has. “I don’t think she feels as bad as I feel for her,” she says, noting that her daughter often turns down allergy-friendly substitutes anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Over time, Larkin has learned that reactions don’t always come from food. A blanket at a play space once caused hives, later traced back to dust, another confirmed allergy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s like, wow, now I know that something in the blanket could have caused it,” Larkin says. Moments like that have taught her that reactions can come from anywhere, not just the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Her daughter carries an EpiPen, though it hasn’t been needed yet. “She has to show two symptoms, and when she just has hives, that’s only one,” Larkin explains of their emergency plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Beyond the immediate reactions, eczema has become another daily challenge. Larkin says they are still learning how much her daughter’s allergies contribute to flare-ups that affect her comfort and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simmy Larkin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simmy and her family&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Recently, her daughter began a new treatment to help manage the condition. “We haven’t really seen any improvements yet, but they say it takes several weeks,” Larkin says, hopeful but realistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For Larkin, sharing the viral video wasn’t about fear but awareness. She hopes parents and caregivers come away understanding how subtle allergic reactions can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Be more mindful of giving kids things and ask their parents,” she says, recalling moments from daycare that could have gone very differently if allergies had been involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even something as common as Goldfish crackers can carry risks, she notes. “It could have impacts on the kid’s health and the type of reaction they have,” Larkin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/mom-records-daughters-allergic-reaction-without-realizing-it-exclusive-11873786" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News Canada</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 16:44:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9NZjFKMHZiSEUxRllscWllaFdKc2dEVjRyOThjWDhRVlRsZ1VKWS1fYW5sbXNVWVhaMVJsS3psOXFzY3NXdXZzbXVFdHBoUjhCWUEwdWtjUXcybXVYRkNFM0RwRm83amlHWU1WUDRXMGxHMm15NDhn</guid></item><item><title>多吃维生素C可以改变你的皮肤- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251226045343.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;Scientists at the University of Otago, Faculty of Medicine -- Christchurch Ōtautahi, have identified a direct connection between how much vitamin C people eat and how well their skin produces collagen and renews itself. The findings show that skin health responds measurably to dietary vitamin C, not just topical treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Investigative Dermatology&lt;/em&gt;, the research found that vitamin C levels in the skin closely mirror levels in the blood (plasma). Increasing intake through vitamin C rich foods was shown to raise both blood and skin concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eating Vitamin C Raises Skin Levels and Thickness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study followed 24 healthy adults in Aotearoa New Zealand and Germany. Participants who raised their plasma vitamin C levels by eating two vitamin C rich SunGoldTM kiwifruit each day showed a clear increase in vitamin C within their skin. This increase was associated with thicker skin (collagen production) and greater renewal of the outer skin layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead author Professor Margreet Vissers from Mātai Hāora -- Centre for Redox Biology and Medicine within the Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine described the results as striking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strength of the association between skin thickness and vitamin C intake is "compelling," she explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin C Moves From Blood to Skin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Professor Vissers, the relationship between blood vitamin C and skin vitamin C stood out compared to other organs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We were surprised by the tight correlation between plasma vitamin C levels and those in the skin -- this was much more marked than in any other organ we have investigated," she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team also found that vitamin C circulating in the bloodstream reaches every layer of the skin and supports healthier skin function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are the first to demonstrate that vitamin C in the blood circulation penetrates all layers of the skin and is associated with improved skin function. I am very proud of my team and excited about what the data is telling us."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Diet Matters More Than Creams&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Vissers says the findings reinforce the idea that skin health begins internally, with nutrients delivered naturally through the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin C is essential for collagen production, which is why it is commonly added to skincare products. However, vitamin C dissolves easily in water and does not absorb well through the outer skin barrier. The study showed that skin cells are highly efficient at absorbing vitamin C from the blood, with uptake into the outer epidermal layer appearing to be a priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the Study Was Conducted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by New Zealand company Zespri International along with a University of Otago Research Grant and included two phases. The first phase examined the relationship between plasma and skin vitamin C levels using healthy skin tissue from patients undergoing elective surgical procedures at Te Whatu Ora Canterbury (with support from the Otago campus's He Taonga Tapu -- Canterbury Cancer Society Tissue Bank).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second phase involved a controlled dietary intervention carried out in Christchurch and Germany. Each location included 12 healthy participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eight Weeks of Dietary Change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were asked to eat two Kiwi Gold kiwifruit daily for eight weeks. This provided the equivalent of 250 micrograms of vitamin C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"All were instructed to consume two Kiwi Gold kiwifruit daily -- the equivalent of 250 micrograms of vitamin C -- for eight weeks. We then collected skin samples before and after the intervention, with separate analyses allowing us to look at the skin basal layers in Christchurch and the outer dermal skin layer and skin function tests in Germany," Professor Vissers explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German participants were recruited and tested by the SGS Institute Fresenius in Hamburg, which has the technical capability to collect samples from the outer dermal skin layer (the blister "roof"). The institute evaluated skin regeneration using ultrasound measurements of skin thickness, elasticity UV protection and epidermal cell renewal to assess overall skin function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clear Gains in Collagen and Skin Renewal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant findings was a measurable rise in skin thickness among participants, indicating increased collagen production along with faster regeneration of epidermal cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The other really substantial finding showed a significant increase in the participants' skin thickness levels, reflecting collagen production and an upsurge in the regeneration of their epidermal cells, in other words skin renewal," Professor Vissers says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Vitamin C Foods Likely Offer Similar Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SunGold kiwifruit was selected for the study because of its consistently high vitamin C content. However, the researchers expect similar benefits from other vitamin C rich foods, especially fresh fruits and vegetables such as citrus, berries, capsicums and broccoli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We suggest that increasing your dietary vitamin C intake will result in effective vitamin C uptake into all compartments of the skin," Professor Vissers says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daily Intake Is Key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining steady vitamin C levels in the blood is essential, since the body does not store the vitamin long term. Professor Vissers notes that healthy individuals can reach optimal plasma levels with about 250mg of vitamin C per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The important thing is to keep your plasma levels optimal, which we know can be easily achieved in a healthy person with a vitamin C intake of around 250mg per day. The body however does not store the vitamin, so we recommend 5+ a day, every day, with one of those five being a high vitamin C food, as a good habit to cultivate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;It’s beginning to look like a lot like a flu Christmas. Surges of influenza are hitting parts of the U.S. hard, and the worst is yet to come.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Various regions of the country have reported a dramatic climb in cases lately, including New York City. Overall activity is on the rise nationwide, as are flu-related hospitalizations and deaths. This season is being fueled by an unexpected strain of “super flu.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The “super flu”&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A typical flu season is nothing to brush off. Annually, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/past-seasons.html"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt; sickens millions of Americans, hospitalizes hundreds of thousands, and kills tens of thousands. But this winter has brought along an especially nasty variant of the H3N2 flu known as subclade K.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The variant is noticeably different on a genetic level from the flu strains scientists predicted would be circulating this season, meaning our vaccines aren’t as effective against it as usual. Subclade K emerged towards the end of the winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and since then, it’s quickly supplanted other strains of H3N2 and other flu viruses in general worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;K already caused the flu season to arrive weeks ahead of schedule in &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-surprise-flu-variant-threw-off-the-vaccine-get-ready-for-a-brutal-winter-2000686095" target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-general/japan-sees-early-flu-activity-school-closures" target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;Asian&lt;/a&gt; countries. In the UK, it’s helped cause a spike of hospitalizations and an &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2025/12/nhs-facing-worst-case-scenario-december-amid-super-flu-surge/" target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;“unprecedented wave of super flu.”&lt;/a&gt; And now it’s clearly making its mark in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Several school districts have had to &lt;a href="https://www.kcrg.com/2025/12/09/iowa-school-district-cancels-classes-due-flu-outbreak/"&gt;temporarily&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/new-hampshire-school-influenza-outbreak-121725/69802064" target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; due to flu outbreaks, while some hospitals &lt;a href="https://news4sanantonio.com/news/local/san-antonio-hospitals-see-surge-in-emergency-visits-as-super-flu-strain-hits-early" target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;are&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wgrz.com/article/news/health/flu-cases-surging-at-oishei-childrens-hospital-as-doctors-warn-of-severe-season/71-f8ed7826-af48-41e2-ba06-841310abc6b6"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; an alarming rise of cases. Data &lt;a href="https://a816-health.nyc.gov/hdi/epiquery/visualizations?PageType=ps&amp;amp;PopulationSource=Syndromic" target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;collected&lt;/a&gt; from the NYC Health Department shows that nearly 10,000 emergency room visits of flu-like illness were reported last week—the largest weekly peak seen in at least a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;According to the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-50.html" target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;latest flu surveillance data&lt;/a&gt; (covering up to Dec. 13), the majority of new infections are being caused by H3N2. Flu activity is “very high” or “high” in 17 regions of the U.S., including NYC, and “moderate” in another 8 jurisdictions. Two more pediatric deaths were reported that week, rising the total to 3 deaths so far this season. And we almost certainly haven’t reached the peak yet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What to do&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are some silver linings to this bad flu season.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For starters, subclade K doesn’t seem to have any mutations that make it more likely to cause severe illness compared to other H3N2 strains. And though the seasonal flu vaccine is mismatched to the variant, it’s not worthless. UK data has &lt;a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.46.2500854#html_fulltext:~:text=Despite%20the%20emergence,cohorts%20%5B26%5D." target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that the vaccine is still providing significant protection from serious complications, especially in children.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This means that vaccination remains a crucial tool against flu this winter. So it’s still worthwhile to get your flu shot even now, though you should keep in mind that it takes around two weeks for the vaccine’s protection to kick in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You should also practice good hygiene like regularly washing your hands, trying to stay home if you’re sick, and potentially wearing a mask in higher-risk situations for added protection. Well-fitting, high-quality masks such as a KN95 or N95 are the most effective.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

They do it to boost energy, immunity, bone strength, or overall wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatine is one such supplement that has become a common staple in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/blue-green-microalgae-spirulina-supplement-has-more-vital-b12-than-milk-or-meat/"&gt;supplement aisles&lt;/a&gt;. It has reputation of being something only necessary for people who work out heavily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athletes use it to sprint harder, lift heavier, and recover faster, so plenty of people treat it as a “gym thing.” In simple terms, creatine acts like a quick-charge backup system for cells that burn through energy fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-creatine-and-cellular-energy"&gt;Creatine and cellular energy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells run on energy every second of every day, then they spend it in a form called Adenosine triphosphate (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ATP&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATP works as the main “spendable” energy molecule, but cells burn through it quickly during intense exercise, illness, missed sleep, or other high-demand stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatine helps by storing energy in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/phosphocreatine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;phosphocreatine&lt;/a&gt;, which can help rebuild ATP when demand spikes. This setup works as a “quick-recharge system.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One report also links this backup to cell protection during metabolic stress, when tissues need fast energy support to stay stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-creatine-energy-and-safety"&gt;Creatine, energy, and safety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People still ask, “Is creatine safe?” A major safety analysis led by a long-time creatine researcher focuses on results from controlled scientific studies instead of word-of-mouth warnings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Richard Kreider, a professor and director of the Exercise &amp;amp; Sport Nutrition Lab at &lt;a href="https://education.tamu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Texas A&amp;amp;M University&lt;/a&gt;, creatine is crucial for human bodies to function at full capacity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When the body is stressed, like in exercise or under metabolic conditions like some diseases, creatine phosphate is needed to maintain energy in the cell, and therefore has a lot of protective and health benefits, in addition to the exercise performance effects that have been seen,” explained Kreider, who has spent more than 30 years studying creatine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15502783.2025.2488937#d1e242" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;comprehensive study&lt;/a&gt;, Kreider’s team reviewed hundreds of clinical trials and compared side effects in people who took creatine with people who took a placebo. They did not see meaningful differences in side-effect rates between the groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the loudest claims of side effects come as personal stories: “My friend felt bloated,” “Someone online said it hurt kidneys,” “A coach warned me about cramps.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kreider’s study refutes those claims, showing that creatine can actually help the body hold onto more fluid, and that may reduce cramping in some situations. People vary, but the strongest evidence does not match the most common fears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-food-vs-supplements"&gt;Food vs. supplements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your body can make creatine from amino acids and move it through the bloodstream to tissues that need quick energy support. Kreider’s study puts that internal production at about one gram each day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the recommended daily amount is to get two to four grams of creatine per day, depending on muscle mass and activity levels.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You only get about a gram of creatine per pound of red meat or fish, like salmon, so it’s expensive and takes a lot of calories to get a gram,” Kreider noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is a lot of food if your main goal is simply to raise creatine intake, which helps explain why creatine supplements exist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vegetarians and vegans often start with lower creatine stores because they get little creatine through diet, so they may see a more noticeable benefit when they supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-creatine-and-the-brain"&gt;Studying creatine and the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://news.vt.edu/articles/2025/06/research_fralinbiomed_chenacd_0625.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;separate study&lt;/a&gt; from Virginia Tech explains that creatine plays a vital role in the brain’s energy system, but it also points to effects beyond “energy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Creatine is very crucial for energy-consuming cells in skeletal muscle throughout the body, but also in the brain and in the heart,” said Chin-Yi Chen, a research scientist at Virginia Tech’s &lt;a href="https://fbri.vtc.vt.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Fralin Biomedical Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chen is working with a research team that is developing a new way to send creatine directly into the brain using focused ultrasound. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project takes place in the lab of Cheng-Chia “Fred” Wu, an assistant professor at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-creatine-and-brain-function"&gt;Creatine and brain function&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dopamine-enhances-brain-function-during-exercise/"&gt;human brain&lt;/a&gt; works nonstop. Neurons fire, support cells keep the chemical environment steady, and energy demand stays high from morning to night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatine can influence neurotransmitter systems, especially pathways involving &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;GABA&lt;/a&gt;, a major inhibitory neurotransmitter that helps prevent neurons from becoming overly excitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fact is important because brain function depends on both steady fuel and balanced signaling. When neurons lose either one, circuits can misfire or struggle to adapt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That helps explain why many studies associate creatine with learning, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-and-inexpensive-supplement-prebiotic-fructooligosaccharides-protects-your-brain-from-dementia/"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;, brain development, and seizure control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-brain-barrier"&gt;Blood-brain barrier&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain sits behind the blood-brain barrier, a tight filter built from cells that line brain blood vessels. It blocks many toxins and pathogens from reaching brain tissue, and that protection saves lives. It can also limit access for helpful compounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu’s study at Virginia Tech describes people with creatine deficiency disorders who can improve muscle mass and body weight with supplements, yet still struggle with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-plastics-chemical-bpa-linked-to-autism-adhd-in-children/"&gt;neurodevelopmental&lt;/a&gt; challenges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include difficulties with speech, reading, or writing because the brain does not receive enough creatine through normal routes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That challenge puts the creatine delivery system at the center of their work. The researchers describe a project that uses therapeutic focused ultrasound to temporarily open access across the blood-brain barrier in a precise, targeted way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focused ultrasound uses carefully aimed sound waves to create a short window that can let treatments reach specific brain areas without damaging nearby healthy tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report notes that the lab has explored focused ultrasound approaches in other contexts, such as pediatric brain cancer, and now sees potential for creatine deficiency conditions as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-creatine-energy-and-brain-function"&gt;Creatine, energy, and brain function&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite strong scientific evidence, Kreider says people have misunderstood creatine for years and often spread false claims about it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is one of the members of the &lt;a href="https://www.sportsnutritionsociety.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;International Society of Sports Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; who recently signed a letter stating that creatine is safe and effective and calling on policymakers not to limit public access to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s absolutely no data supporting any negative side effect anecdotally reported about creatine on the internet and in the media,” Kreider enthused. “Creatine is safe, and it’s important for everybody, not just bodybuilders and athletes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work keeps moving from “Does it work?” to “Can we deliver it where it’s needed most?” That question changes the discussion from sports performance to medical delivery, where the details of human biology decide what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 16:13:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxQWXVVdk00VFRWVUFOWjJRakJqWHBVa2tjaFFncUQ0bFVhNUFNZ01yU1l6VS10eUU3ZUFkRkkwQUR3ZTV1WGgwTXRkdzdHajZPcW8zY0VnbzAyVjV4MDdwYWN3MkhzaW9ZYUlmRC1XN3BOY2RhYnRkX21GcVpNVlFHOFdQT1dneVhZQ0FmZjN0SU5XYXczXzZNYzBYUzYwczd5RnNz</guid></item><item><title>完美的早晨例行公事：如何建立一个快乐、健康的一天开始--从淋浴到阳光明媚--《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/26/perfect-morning-routine-happy-healthy-start-showers-sunshine</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he first thing to say about the ideal morning routine is that it probably doesn’t exist. Yes, endless influencers promise that they have tweaked, tested and fine-tuned the process of revving up for the day, but how history’s most productive people &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; get things done is so varied that it’s hard to draw definitive conclusions. Beethoven, reportedly, used to count out exactly 60 beans for his morning cup of coffee, while Victor Hugo downed two raw eggs after reading a daily missive from his mistress. Mark Wahlberg, on the other hand, wakes at &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Ej-o9ooFqcQ" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;3am&lt;/a&gt; for pre-workout prayer, chasing up his gym time with a few holes of golf and a jolt in the cryo chamber before he even thinks about doing any work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is clear, though, that having some sort of routine is key: a set of automatic actions that you do every day, to ease you into your responsibilities with a bit of momentum and a fresh frame of mind. And there is some stuff that seems beneficial enough that everyone should be doing a version of it, even if individual methods differ: one person’s meditative bean arithmetic, after all, is another’s mindfulness. But if you want to finesse your routine, the key is to add one change at a time. &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;When you focus on a single behaviour,” says the behaviour change specialist Dr Heather McKee, “you build confidence through quick wins, and give your brain the clarity and dopamine hit it needs to automate that action. Once that habit feels natural, you free up mental space to layer in the next change.” But what habits should you be building?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="5b7d789a-a77e-4871-acb8-11ba2837fc53" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Dogs are the perfect excuse to get a dose of morning light.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Posed by model; Olga Rolenko/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="get-up-get-out" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get up, get out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;First things first: there’s no single best time to get up. If you have the luxury of picking your own window, it’s probably best to start by roughly working out your chronotype, which boils down to if you feel and perform best earlier in the day, you can probably get away with getting up a bit earlier (if you do your best work at night, of course, it would be ideal to sleep in).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Most adults need between seven and nine hours’ sleep to feel fully functional, and you probably have a good idea of where you fall in that range. In an ideal world, you shouldn’t need an alarm to wake up: if that means going to bed at 10 so you’re feeling fresh by 6am, that’s the way forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ellie Hambly, a clinical psychologist specialising in helping families deal with stress, advises getting outside in the morning light. “This is getting harder with daylight hours reducing, but trying to manage your diary around getting some daylight can make a huge difference in your mood.” Morning exposure to natural sunlight plays a key role in keeping our body clock working properly. It suppresses melatonin, boosts serotonin, gets you ready for the day – and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39077837/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;seems to help people sleep better&lt;/a&gt; at night. If you have a dog or a running habit, great – but it’s even worth poking your head out of the door while you enjoy your morning coffee. “If you can make the time for a short walk without your phone in the morning, the combination of movement and lack of stimulation can help to activate your brain’s default mode network – the set of brain regions engaged in introspection and daydreaming,” says Hambly. “That can help with creative problem-solving and coming up with new ideas. If you don’t have time for a walk, even taking a shower without a podcast can work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="efb00c4b-f635-4ec5-836e-3364af22114f" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Getting outside in the morning light can make a huge difference.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Posed by model; Brook Pifer/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="put-the-kettle-on" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Put the kettle on&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Recently, it’s become fashionable among self-optimisers to claim that you should wait 60-90 minutes to drink your first coffee to avoid an afternoon crash. This sounds plausible, but a &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/15502783.2024.2323919?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;review of studies&lt;/a&gt; published in 2024 concluded that there’s no evidence this happens – and caffeine has also been shown to increase exercise performance in a variety of ways, so it’s definitely worth having a coffee if you’re going to work out (giving it 20-30 minutes to let the effects kick in). Otherwise, just do what’s most comfortable for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="08c288e0-01f8-4543-a6b5-913030a24ad4" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Go with your natural flow.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Posed by models; Thomas Barwick/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Should you exercise first thing? If you can face it, yes: at least a bit. The best time of day to hit the gym seems to vary depending on your chronotype, specific goals and preferred workout style: morning exercise, for instance, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26844280/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;can help with burning fat&lt;/a&gt;, and strength-building sessions are also &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27863207/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;probably slightly better&lt;/a&gt; if your aim is muscle. But it’s possible that you can “retrain” your body to work out more effectively at different times of day by doing it consistently (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25631930/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one study on swimmers&lt;/a&gt; found that both chronotype and habitual training time are important). However, morning workouts seem to have a host of benefits all of their own, from &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40419564/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reducing body fat to improving sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;On a more basic note, it’s also just easier to ensure you get your workouts done if you schedule them first thing, with no chance of a random pub invite or work demand getting in the way. If you can’t face a full-on run or dragging the dumbbells out from under the bed, it helps to have a pre-set, full-body routine that’s simple enough to do in your living room while everyone else dashes around eating toast and doing last-minute homework. The “slow” burpee is a winner here: squat down low, put your hands on the floor (between your feet if you can), then step one foot back at a time until you’re in a plank position. Do a press-up if you’ve got it in you, then reverse the whole process to come back to your feet: a handful of these will hit your arms, legs and core while also helping you stretch out stiff joints. Start with five, and work your way up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Read a line of poetry, sip your tea, write a quick reflection, or get through a couple of pages of a book&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="cold-comforts" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Cold comforts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;How cold should your morning shower be? Again, this depends on what you’re going for. There is some evidence that hosing yourself down with frosty water in the morning can offer physiological benefits: cold exposure can trigger the release of endorphins and help your parasympathetic nervous system (the restful one) kick in, so even if it doesn’t feel like it in the moment, it’s probably cheering you up. On the flipside, a cold shock is potentially going to jolt you out of any default mode network thinking that’s helping you to solve problems or think creatively. But there’s a best-of-both-worlds approach. “I recommend to my coaching clients that they introduce hot and cold cycling as part of their morning routine for both the physical and mental benefits,” says the wellness expert Tana Hoffman Cook. “For people who are just starting out, even ending your shower with a cold blast can offer health benefits – cold exposure has been linked to increased dopamine levels, making it a powerful addition to anyone’s morning routine when they want to start their day feeling alert, clear-headed and with a mood-boost.”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;index&amp;quot;:16,&amp;quot;listId&amp;quot;:6060,&amp;quot;identityName&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;how-to-have-a-better-day&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Sign up to our 16-part series and get expert advice on how to improve your life - from morning to night&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;How to have a better day&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;frequency&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Twice weekly, for eight weeks&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;successDescription&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;You're signed up to How to have a better day.&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;features&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;idApiUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://idapi.theguardian.com&amp;quot;}"&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure id="b6aa2ace-6a53-45b2-b357-9a1d8b1dd80f" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Judgment-free scribbles can boost physical and psychological health.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Posed by model; Luis Alvarez/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="scribble-it-out" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Scribble it out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;What about journalling, which is frequently recommended? A 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-psychiatric-treatment/article/emotional-and-physical-health-benefits-of-expressive-writing/ED2976A61F5DE56B46F07A1CE9EA9F9F" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;review of studies&lt;/a&gt; found that writing about stressful or emotional events for a few minutes resulted in improvements in physical and psychological health in non-clinical and clinical populations. “Morning pages”, as they’re sometimes known, can work as a sort of lower-stakes version of that: aiming to fill a page or two with judgment-free scribble (that you’re definitely allowed to throw away afterwards) might help you reorganise your thoughts before you go about your day, or at least get your biggest worries down on paper. If you’re struggling to get anything out, use a prompt as an easy starting point: “What’s the biggest thing I’m worried about?” or “What’s one thing I want to focus on today?” Or you could be more specific with something like: “How am I actually going to get this project done on time?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="mindfulness-on-the-go" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Mindfulness on the go&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure id="b6ea70a8-6560-4841-8ee3-bcf0f350683e" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Meditation can be alternated with breathing techniques.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Posed by model; pixdeluxe/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As for meditation, the benefits are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10355843/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;well established&lt;/a&gt; – they range from reduced anxiety to a boosted immune system – but if your mornings are too chaotic to sit in a quiet space (or plug into an app for 10 minutes), it might be worth starting with something a bit simpler. “I use something called the Ease morning routine to start the day with nervous system regulation rather than jumping straight into hustle mode,” says the wellbeing coach and yoga teacher Chloe Markham. “We begin with an Exhale, or stillness. If I don’t have time to meditate, I’ll use the 4-7-8 breathing technique: breathe in gently through your nose for a count of four, hold for seven, and breathe out through your mouth for eight. Next, we Anchor – this is where we clock in with the way our body feels and maybe set a soft intention for the day.” Spend a second listening to your body, she suggests, and maybe change your goals accordingly. “If you’re feeling energised, great! If not, maybe scale things back a bit. The next step is movement, or Shift – this is about moving our bodies in ways that feel good – and the final step is to Engage in something nourishing: read a line of poetry, sip your tea, write a quick reflection or get through a couple of pages of a book.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;You could try to sneak in a bit of mindfulness while you do the washing-up&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Whether it takes five minutes or 95, she says, “this sort of routine cannot only prepare us for a calmer day, but also can strengthen our nervous system’s ability to self-regulate more quickly. The magic comes from consistency rather than perfection.” And if all that takes too much time, you could try to sneak in a bit of mindfulness while you do the washing-up: in &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-014-0360-9" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one paper from Florida State University&lt;/a&gt;, a group of volunteers who read a text that encouraged them to focus their thoughts on the sensations evoked by the activity they were doing reported increases in elements of “positive affect” (such as inspiration) and decreased nervousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“You don’t need a 5am wake-up call or a one-hour ritual to have a ‘good’ morning,” says the yoga teacher Maysun Hassanaly. “What matters is consistency. Think small daily doses of feelgood moments to lift your mood, that are useful and doable. Think of your mornings in three layers: must-do, nice-to-have and optional. On busy days, stick to your must-dos: the simple actions that ground you or energise you. On slower mornings, add a nice-to-have or two. It could be something as small as putting on your favourite song and having a quick dance, walking one extra bus stop, or taking a moment to notice the morning light. Tiny rituals like these help you feel calmer and in control of your day, without sacrificing sleep or overloading your to-do list.” You can’t micromanage everything that’s going to happen for the rest of the day, or everything that’s going on in the world – so for 10 minutes after you wake up, why not just be a bit nicer to yourself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxQc1BuYWVYc29TaEM1RWQtLW5BSHJOMEZnVjhPNjlMTjFIU1lnYVBHTjhoYV9mWHhiLUt6MVVIQ3ZXMks4R2lVZnh1Vmx5aV9DeWlCdUtqYlJ3eG14dTkyU0pZSy1RQ3hvOWZESkhLaHNqZjBfSTVJWEVxVWdKZmRLWXFvRjhVZ3dsV01tRnhVdXd3RUMxeEduUnoybm15b01DUmVxQU1kRGVkSzJnN3E1elphdw</guid></item><item><title>新的研究发现，社交媒体，而不是游戏，与青少年日益严重的注意力问题有关- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-12-social-media-gaming-attention-problems.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="success-screen" id="successScreen"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pomegranate juice is rich in antioxidants and may offer blood pressure and heart health benefits when you drink it daily.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The best time to drink it depends on your individual health, but you may consider having it in the morning or early afternoon for easier digestion and more energy.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As long as you drink it consistently, there is no ideal time to consume &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/pomegranate-juice-11839039" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pomegranate juice&lt;/a&gt; for heart health, according to &lt;a href="https://health.usf.edu/publichealth/overviewcoph/faculty/lywright" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Lauri Wright, PhD, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, director of nutrition programs and an associate professor at USF College of Public Health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "What matters most is consistent intake, because the heart-healthy compounds, especially &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/polyphenols-5217399" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;polyphenols&lt;/a&gt;, work by gradually improving blood vessel function and reducing oxidative stress," she said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, Wright said that people with stomach sensitivities may want to drink pomegranate juice in the morning or early afternoon for easier digestion. Drinking it in the morning can also provide you with energy for your day.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re prone to reflux, drinking acidic juices like pomegranate right before bed may worsen heartburn, said &lt;a href="https://www.missouristate.edu/SHS/profile-display.aspx?p=natalieallen" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Natalie Allen, RD&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical associate professor of nutrition and dietetics at Missouri State University.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And if you have diabetes or insulin resistance, drinking it on an empty stomach, especially first thing in the morning, may cause a sharper blood sugar rise. In that case, it's best to pair pomegranate juice with a meal or protein-rich snack, according to Wright.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/pomegranate-11828597" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Pomegranate juice&lt;/a&gt; may also interact with certain blood pressure, statin, or blood-thinning drugs, so anyone on these medications should check with their healthcare provider before adding it to their daily routine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Overall, there’s no single 'wrong' time," Wright said. "Just choose a time when it feels best for your digestion and blood sugar control."&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When trying to get the most benefit from drinking pomegranate juice, consistency matters more than timing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Drink it regularly to see health benefits," Allen said. "Studies showing blood pressure benefits typically look at daily intake, not the timing of when you drink the juice."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Generally, fruits and vegetables that are brightly colored are high in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/foods-with-more-antioxidants-than-pomegranate-seeds-11835037" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;, Allen explained, and pomegranates are no exception. Pomegranate juice is loaded with polyphenols, which help keep blood vessels smooth.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Pomegranates also help the body make and use nitric oxide, a compound that relaxes blood vessels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "I like to think of it this way: drinking pomegranate juice is like a gentle massage for your arteries," Allen said. "We want them flexible, relaxed, and smooth, and this juice helps support just that."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some studies also show modest reductions in LDL oxidation, which is helpful for long-term cardiovascular health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But keep in mind that these effects typically occur with regular intake over weeks, Wright said, not from just one glass.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Ocala physician has been fined $7,500 and placed on probation by state health officials following a medical malpractice complaint that he prescribed unnecessary thyroid medication to a patient who then suffered a heart attack as a result. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Steven Charles Tieche, who practices at the Recharge Clinic on SW 17th Street in Ocala, appeared before the Florida Board of Medicine on December 5, in Dania Beach. The Board issued its final order on Monday, December 22, placing Tieche’s license on probation for one year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the administrative complaint adopted by the Board, a patient presented to Tieche at Recharge Clinic in June 2023 to discuss hormone replacement therapy. Following an evaluation, Tieche interpreted the patient’s lab results as indicating low thyroid levels. As a result, he prescribed compound thyroid supplements LT3 and LT4.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In early July, Tieche increased the patient’s dosage. By mid-August, the patient returned with severe symptoms, including anxiety, tremors, irregular heart rate, and vomiting, leading Tieche to discontinue the supplements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Days later, on August 21, 2023, the patient was admitted to the UF Health Leesburg Emergency Department with chest pain and diagnosed with a myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A subsequent review by an endocrinologist revealed that the patient’s original lab results from June showed normal thyroid levels. The specialist diagnosed the patient with thyrotoxicosis, a condition caused by abnormally high levels of thyroid hormone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;State investigators determined that Tieche failed to meet the prevailing professional standard of care by prescribing the supplements in the absence of a confirmed diagnosis of hypothyroidism. The Department of Health charged Tieche with medical malpractice under Florida Statutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the December hearing, Tieche was present and represented by counsel, but the facts of the case were not in dispute. Under the terms of the final order, the Ocala doctor must pay an administrative fine of $7,500 and case costs of $2,847.21 within 30 days. He is also required to complete five hours of continuing medical education (CME), specifically in the area of Thyroid Disorders, within one year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During his one-year probation, Tieche is prohibited from practicing medicine without indirect supervision from a board-certified family practice or internal medicine physician. This monitoring physician must review 100 percent of Tieche’s endocrine patient records and 25 percent of his active patient records once every quarter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tieche must also appear before the board’s probation committee at the beginning and end of his probationary period.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tieche, who co-founded Recharge Clinic with his wife, is a board certified physician in anesthesiology and holds multiple other certifications. &lt;/p&gt;
