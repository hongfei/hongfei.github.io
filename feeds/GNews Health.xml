						&lt;p&gt;Multiple children have been treated in Wake County emergency
rooms for a rare, but painful skin condition in recent weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Holly Rund shared her five-year-old daughter Lexi was in so
much pain last weekend that it caused Lexi to scream when she was touched. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“At first I thought it was hand-foot-and-mouth, and I
noticed she had a blister,” Holly recalled. “There were two on her legs and one
on her side.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Lexi’s pain grew worse, and she said her skin became itchy. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“The one on her side, when I looked at it, that was when I
knew something wasn’t right. It was yellow and puffed out and really big,” Holly
said. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Lexi described her symptoms in three simple words: “It
really hurt.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The mother took her daughter to the WakeMed Raleigh
emergency department on Sunday to get examined. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/ritters-disease-skin-health-july-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/ritters-disease-skin-health-july-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;That’s when the Runds learned Lexi had a rare but painful
condition called staphylococcal scalding skin syndrome (SSSS), also known as
Ritter’s Disease.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Lexi was kept overnight and treated with IV fluids and antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Dr. Graham Snyder is an emergency physician who sees patients
at WakeMed Raleigh and is the medical director of the hospital system’s medical
simulation center. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The physician shared he treated a different patient with the
same condition earlier this week. It was the first time he'd seen the condition this year. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“When I walked in the room and saw a patient recently, my first
thought was ‘Oh this is impetigo,’ which is just a little thing kids get from
scratching mosquito bites,” Snyder said. “The thing that was different was the
child had redness over their entire body, and their skin hurt. Normally rashes
don’t hurt. They may itch, but if a rash hurts you have to ask yourself if
something else is going on.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/ritters-disease-skin-health-july-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/ritters-disease-skin-health-july-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Snyder explained the bacteria behind SSSS sometimes grows after
a child gets a cut, or if they have been scratching their skin a lot – like if
they have allergies or eczema.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Staphylococcus, which is just like the staph infection you’ve
always heard of, emits a toxin into the blood that goes into the skin and
damages the skin, almost like a burn,” Snyder explained. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The rash and sores may sometimes be initially misdiagnosed
with pediatricians as other conditions, like hand-foot-and-mouth disease.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“The combination of pain being everywhere in the body and sometimes
you can have a combination of fever at the same time, should kind of raise your
suspicion,” Snyder warned. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;WakeMed has seen six cases so far this year, and all of them have
been pediatric.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Snyder says the number isn’t abnormal and added that multiple
cases have been reported within the past few weeks, which is slightly unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;WRAL also reached out to Duke Health and UNC Health
regarding any potential cases this year.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Duke Health officials reported they had not seen an increase
in cases and UNC Health shared they had not seen any cases this year.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Holly said she wants to warn other parents to take their
little one’s symptoms seriously and seek medical attention to keep it from
spreading to others. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“If you see one bump and it looks like that, go in. It’s
better to be safe than sorry. There’s no such thing as overreacting,” Holly said.
&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;SSSS is contagious and can live on surfaces for 24 hours. The
condition can be serious for children, &lt;a href="https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/conditions/staphylococcus-scalded-skin-syndrome#:~:text=SSSS%20is%20not%20a%20common,their%20noses%2C%20without%20getting%20sick."&gt;but
mild cases may be resolved on their own&lt;/a&gt;, according to the National Children’s
Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;The responses were illuminating, validating, and honestly, overdue. I definitely learned (and fact-checked) a few things that blew my mind.

There’s no cure for MND.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In mid-July, Bray passed away. In previous interviews, Bray had said that her decision to follow VSED (Voluntarily Stopping Eating And Drinking) was not taken lightly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="6-687961d642974__700" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/group-speaks-out-after-woman-ends-her-own-life-by-voluntarily-stopping-eating-and-drinking/?image_id=6-687961d642974__700.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="After Woman Ended Her Own Life By Starving, Support Group Breaks Silence" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/group-speaks-out-after-woman-ends-her-own-life-by-voluntarily-stopping-eating-and-drinking/?media_id=6-687961d642974__700" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/6-687961d642974__700.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/6-687961d642974__700.jpg" alt="Hospital room with empty bed and flowers, symbolizing support group response after woman ended her own life by starving." title="Hospital room with empty bed and flowers, symbolizing support group response after woman ended her own life by starving." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/pt-br/fotografias/quarto-de-hospital-WPtgfxGpTm0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I can no longer do any basic tasks. I can’t scratch an itch, push up my glasses, or move a bed sheet if I am too hot or cold. My talking is severely affected and I struggle to eat and it’s getting harder to breathe,” Bray had told The Mirror.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But perhaps the worst thing, Bray explained, was watching your children cry and get upset because their mother is deteriorating, and not being able to comfort them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Watching your children grieve for you and not being able to hug them is the most painful feeling ever,” she said before her passing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The last bit of parenting I can do is to limit the suffering and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/elementary-graduation-devolves-into-brawl-between-parents/" class="

limiting demise awaiting her, Bray made the conscious and voluntary decision to stop eating and drinking to hasten the end of her life. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In recent years, Bray had become an advocate for medically assisted euthanasia, saying that had a bill been in place, it would have saved her family from suffering as they watched her deteriorate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Only last month, lawmakers in England &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;voted in favor of the “Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life)” law, which would legalize the procedure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As per &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reuters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the bill “now proceeds to Britain’s upper chamber, the House of Lords, where it will undergo months of scrutiny.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;VSED is not the same as medically assisted euthanasia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p

U.K. said was important. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;During an interview with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bored Panda&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Aly Dickinson, who runs the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;‘Living well and dying well South West’ group, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;explained that “VSED is a legal, self-directed decision to stop eating and drinking, leading to a natural d*ath,” and that it doesn’t involve “medical professionals actively ending life.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dickinson, an end of life doula in the U.K., said with VSED the only thing medical professionals provide is comfort and care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She explained that planning is key when it comes to the decision to participate in VSED.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Things like: “choosing the place of d*ath (typically at home, or in a hospice if the hospice is willing to support VSED, “ as well as writing an end of life plan that includes a statement of Advance Refused Treatment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block"

data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dickinson said that when it comes to who should consider VSED, there are two main groups of people: “Those experiencing unacceptable suffering, or those seeking to pre-empt the final stage of d*ing, in order to avoid future suffering or a loss of dignity.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dickinson said VSED could also be suitable for those “diagnosed with early-stage dementia who retain mental capacity and wish to avoid a prolonged decline.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other possible candidates include people “living with a progressive terminal illness who have decision-making capacity,” or those “facing significant loss of independence due to frailty and chronic health issues, but who still have mental capacity.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But Dickinson stressed that more needs to be done to educate the public about VSED. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Stories like Emma Bray’s—shared so generously—helps bring much-needed visibility to this deeply personal choice,” she told Bored Panda.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Canada, instances of misusing MAiD were investigated by the UN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media"

the Netherlands and Switzerland as other countries where the service is permitted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Canada, the option is called MAiD, which stands for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Medical Assistance in D*ing, and is performed by a qualified medical practitioner “to provide a person with assistance to end their life, provided they meet specific eligibility criteria.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The procedure became legal in 2016 and has been a hot button issue in the country ever since, with some people saying it’s

a coffin-like device which fills with nitrogen to bring an end of life to users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first instance of someone using the device was last September in the forests of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Schaffhausen, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Switzerland, when an American woman who was reportedly terminally ill chose &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/euthanasia-pod-woman-switzerland-investigation-strangulation-marks/" class=" staff-link"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sarco&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to end her life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although medically assisted euthanasia is legal in Switzerland, the Sarco pod is not, partly due to the fact that the “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;use of nitrogen in the capsule also contravened with the Chemicals Act.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The only person to witness the woman using the pod was 47-year-old Dr. Florian Willet, the co-president and founder of The Last Resort, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;an assisted euthanasia organization that promotes the pod.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container

neck were the result of Willet strangling the woman. He was never charged, and was later cleared and released.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the trauma of being detained and suspected of strangulation led to an ironic twist in the story, with Willet taking his own life by assisted euthanasia in early June of this year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4grlqv76pno" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;the pod’s inventor, Philip Nitschke, said that his friend Florian Willet had endured too much psychological trauma. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“In the final months of his life, Dr. Florian Willet shouldered more than any man should,” Nitschke told the BBC, saying that Willet’s arrest had left him “broken.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The BBC says Willet used medically assisted euthanasia administered in Germany.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are six countries in Europe with some form of legalized assisted euthanasia including the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain, and starting later this year, Austria.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Netizens remain divided over the topic of medically assisted euthanasia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_1" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_2" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_3" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_4" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Bored Panda</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 18:14:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxOVG8zUnd2UlIyVXlhU29uZmhjdEY0Z2lZYTFXTHRkejZWRmI0Nl9mRlB3VXE5TVRuSkJrdlB0TktWTlhvdlRteDQxaUx6SHRHRmd0QTg0VDFKaHVfaVlpX1JvOFRuZllfLWNzOHFOekVEZlBsM3Q5c2cyQ3BhUng4NjJCU3N3d00tdlhINjlCYUUtOW8tZ29ENjNIWFdXVEVQV1ZzVkhBZUNuX05ubEMtSWZNcjBLVmFoeWc</guid></item><item><title>又是一个女孩！再一次！为什么婴儿的性别不是随机的。-《华盛顿邮报》 | It’s a girl — again!

Chan School of Public Health analyzed data from more than 146,000 pregnancies from 58,000 nurses in the United States between 1956 and 2015. They found that some families were more likely to have children of the same sex than would be expected if each baby had an equal chance of being a boy or a girl. Moms with three or more kids were more likely to have all boys or all girls than expected by chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QX7MUMBMLZHVNP3IIQ23LZVV3M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study suggests that sex at birth follows a weighted probability and that biological influences may sway the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/its-a-boy-its-a-girl-for-some-parents-learning-their-babys-sex-is-a-disappointment/2018/12/12/8aef32c0-f8be-11e8-8d64-4e79db33382f_story.html" target="_blank"&gt;sex of the child&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2G7Y4RPIVBBJXBR6Y5T452CTKI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If you’ve had two girls or three girls and you’re trying for a boy, you should know your odds are not 50-50,” said Jorge Chavarro, the study’s senior author. “You’re more likely than not to have another girl.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AUN7PYD2PREOPB4NNYL4YIE57I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers estimated that families with three girls had a 58 percent chance of having another girl, while families with three boys had a 61 percent chance of having a fourth boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EJLGIG7YVRAZ7EFCYO262C3ZKU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Maternal age is a key factor. Women who started having children after age 28 were slightly more likely to have only boys or only girls. Chavarro said this could reflect age-related biological changes that influence the survival of the Y chromosome carried by boys, such as increased vaginal acidity. Paternal factors could also play a role because maternal and paternal ages are often closely linked. But the study did not include data on fathers, which was noted as a limitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MGJUNFE4ZBEJ7HFO5V7QXZAITE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers also identified two genes associated with giving birth to only boys or only girls. “We don’t know why these genes would be associated with sex at birth, but they are, and that opens up new questions,” Chavarro, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TOF22PWULVH4FIIDPNUHH4B64E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Iain Mathieson, a professor of genetics at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine who was not involved in the study, said the genetic associations should be viewed cautiously. He said the study’s genetic analysis was based on a relatively small sample and may be influenced by other factors, making the results more speculative until confirmed by further research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BZUIS64PMJGUBDARJFDY76WFTI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I don’t find the genetic factors identified here particularly convincing,” Mathieson said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4ZRFJORWN5H2POSUCWTZ6DQFQ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The researchers also found that parents were more likely to have one boy and one girl than would be expected by chance, a pattern they believe reflects a tendency to stop having children once both sexes are represented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YX6XXSCPEJEDVHLZBCOX5KLJWI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To reduce bias from such family planning decisions, they analyzed data after removing each woman’s final child. They also excluded women who had experienced miscarriages or stillbirths to test whether pregnancy loss changed the results. They still found the same pattern: The odds of birth sex did not follow mere chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EWJJ65PXBJFBBCJ53DZSX5AH6A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study suggests it may not have been so improbable for the fictional parents in the TV sitcom “Malcolm in the Middle” to have five sons or for the Bennet family in “Pride and Prejudice” to have five daughters. Even in history, patterns like this have drawn attention. King Louis VII of France, for example, remarried after his first two wives each gave birth to daughters, depriving him of a male heir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2DO6FWXSB5ABBAZ53UXEW53YCQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Chavarro said it might take years to fully understand why some families consistently have children of one sex, but this research is an important place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NMMQB2EFAZG3LDKZE5PMHHARSI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;His team said future studies should explore how lifestyle, nutrition and exposure to environmental chemicals might affect these patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UKJJADTPKNB4JMPZRGGMDLUACE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Certain factors such as race, natural hair color, blood type, body mass index and height were not associated with having children of only one sex.

          &lt;p&gt;Nearly 800,000 doses of mpox vaccine pledged to African countries working to stamp out devastating outbreaks are headed for the waste bin because they weren't shipped in time, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/17/us-has-wasted-hundreds-of-thousands-of-vaccines-meant-for-africa-health-officials-there-say-00460290?utm_campaign=KHN:+First+Edition&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--eszRHhuI8X2faI-mZVE2luzzBgtK1oFhRnCmThGQYTOQfpxJ6mH-8hqkNJJl3U2D6dRENrJ8VXScM47-IJLTksbKauA&amp;amp;_hsmi=371897914&amp;amp;utm_content=371897914&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;according to reporting by Politico&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nearly 800,000 doses were part of a donation promised under the Biden administration, which was meant to deliver more than 1 million doses. Overall, the US, the European Union, and Japan pledged to collectively provide 5 million doses to nearly a dozen African countries. The US has only sent 91,000 doses so far, and only 220,000 currently still have enough shelf life to make it. The rest are expiring within six months, making them ineligible for shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For a vaccine to be shipped to a country, we need a minimum of six months before expiration to ensure that the vaccine can arrive in good condition and also allow the country to implement the vaccination," Yap Boum, an Africa CDC deputy incident manager, told Politico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politico linked the vaccines' lack of timely shipment to the Trump administration's brutal cuts to foreign aid programs as well as the annihilation of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which administered those aid programs.&lt;/p&gt;

So I’ve never been super into her, until the most recent episode of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/articles/just-season-3-starts-twist-124527827.html" data-ylk="slk:And Just Like That;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;And Just Like That&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. In season 3, episode 8, she has an unexpected attack of vertigo, an illness that’s played for laughs but is no joke, evidenced by the polarized comments about it online. As a vertigo alum myself, I've done a deep dive into the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Near the top of the episode, Charlotte is at her gallery, assembling a mattress installation clearly inspired by Tracy Emin’s seminal work &lt;em&gt;My Bed&lt;/em&gt;, when she bends over and moans softly:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Kai, may I have your hand? I think my vertigo is back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I didn’t think vertigo is real?” the gallery worker responds. “You know, like Epstein-Barr.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Oh, it’s a real thing,” Charlotte nods, woozily. “I had it last year, I had to take to my bed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Charlotte’s condition subsides, then recurs during a long set piece at the gallery, in which Charlotte pratfalls while rushing across the room. Again, when Charlotte explains that she fell due to vertigo, another character looks her dismissively and says “Is that even a real thing?” Later that same evening, Charlotte is shown entering her home alone, still bent over from the condition, trying to talk to Lisa on her phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Craig Blankenhorn/HBO Max&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Granted, vertigo isn’t as serious as Charlotte’s husband’s prostate cancer or Miranda’s alcoholism, but online banter calls out the show for its misinformation and insensitivity. In &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/and-just-like-that-recap-season-3-episode-8-happily-ever-after.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Vulture’s comment section;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Vulture’s comment section&lt;/a&gt;, for example, Mediaqueen1985 says she has vertigo, then criticizes the depiction: “Ugh. More Charlotte as Lucy Ricardo but with vertigo as an excuse. Vertigo usually involves heights, so WTH?” Next, an ear-nose and throat specialist writes “vertigo isn’t a fear of heights, but a room-spinning sensation. Charlotte likely had BPPV, although the depiction was a little…off.” Johnandtara chimes in: “Nurse here—and I have a few friends in menopause experiencing vertigo, so I think they are throwing it into the mix as a women of a certain age thing.” And finally Nnfowlds opines: “They sent Charlotte home on her own in a vertigo state? Goofy and irritating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Reality check—according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/21769-vertigo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, “vertigo causes dizziness and makes you feel like you’re spinning when you’re not. It most commonly occurs when there’s an issue with your inner ear. But you can also develop it if you have a condition affecting your brain, like a tumor or stroke. Treatments vary and can include medication, repositioning maneuvers or surgery.” It may or may not involve heights. There are two main types, peripheral and central; peripheral is the common sort. A decade-long &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4110114/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of nearly 1,000 women showed that one type of peripheral, BBPV (Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo), is increasingly common in perimenopausal women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Watching the show, I was perplexed by the lack of sympathy given to Charlotte when she's incapacitated, since I have had stress-induced bouts of the condition. Initially, I woke up with the room spinning so profoundly, alone and frightened, that I speed-dialed a friend to come take me to the emergency room. (My condition was diagnosed and I was given anti-nausea medication.) After subsequent attacks, an ENT taught me the Epley Maneuver, a head movement exercise designed to reposition the ear crystals that cause BBPV. It’s a recurring condition for me, in the manner of commenter Itcouldbeworse: “I had it for months, but only when I got up from bed too quickly (luckily.) The room would spin. Even after it stopped happening, I got up very slowly for a long while, in case it had come back. (The first time it had happened, there was no warning.)”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Here's the rub: Never once did anyone suggest that I might be fantasizing my illness, or doubting that the condition even exists. Nor would anyone have sent me home, unaccompanied, if I couldn’t walk straight. Charlotte deserves better—the poor woman is just regaining her footing, so to speak. She's just been through a recent major health scare with her husband, a massive career responsibility and caretaking a heartbroken daughter and teetotaling friend! A little information about her well-being as well as compassion for her is in order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I’m left with a lingering bad taste about the whole vertigo storyline, maybe best expressed by Hotfoot2020: “Gross how it was played for laughs. I've noticed people aren't very caring on this show when someone's sick. Things get quippy in no time. UGH. Are there any humans left in the writers' room or is this all the work of a Temu bot?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/articles/major-theory-just-season-3-160000065.html" data-ylk="slk:I Have a Major Theory About ‘And Just Like That’ Season 3—and OG ‘Sex and the City’ Fans Are Gonna Love it;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;I Have a Major Theory About ‘And Just Like That’ Season 3—and OG ‘Sex and the City’ Fans Are Gonna Love it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 16:40:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxQalQtTFRMMk4wUUNySl85WWZMRXVyeDdqb2VaRFJSaFlLUnFUSGtOazVWdVE1cGhLdHZrOHNjaWxLeUdVYVRqLVc3MU1tbVU2T0owYzIycWFEUTBacnI4czYxZENkcGlvYS1IY25jSjYzdEVOVEk1TXNPZmw5eEJGQUhaU1h2bFlmUVBSWDEzTExkSVl4N2Y0Zg</guid></item><item><title>益生菌有效吗？ -《经济学人》 | Do probiotics work? - The Economist</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxNTFozMU5NYmNMZFZWZGw4amRqd0tpYXlxYzFRWWNMNG9hcnMyaXM5VXAxYnlRZ3NhaU83c1JPMEZQUFRKRmhiLUNqbGxDdFRMV3FIS1dwRDdHN2YzZ29iVnlFbzNDaWdtVTNHZzREbFBrZFFObDBWOVEzSVNROE92R01jWlQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-5nzj3w ei2yr3n1"&gt;&lt;p data-component="paragraph" class="css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0"&gt;&lt;span data-caps="initial"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt; DAZZLING menagerie&lt;/small&gt; of microbes live inside the human gut—by some counts a few thousand different species.

These factors damage the cells that keep your cornea clear, and they don’t grow back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specifically, the team found that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine caused a patient's cornea to go from 528 to 542 micrometers in thickness, or roughly 0.0208 inches to 0.0213 inches. This is a roughly two-percent increase in micrometers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A slightly thicker cornea isn't automatically harmful. The cornea can thicken temporarily due to inflammation, fluid buildup, or stress on the endothelium from minor illnesses or injuries to the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If it stays too thick for months or years, however, it could make the cornea less clear, potentially affecting vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team did not recommend against vaccination and will still need to conduct long-term testing on patients to see if these changes continue to appear months and years after taking the shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (pictured) has also been tied to rare inflammatory heart conditions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average number of endothelial cells, which keep the cornea clear by pumping out excess fluid, dropped from 2,597 to 2,378 cells per square millimeter in the study, a loss of about eight percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Normal endothelial cell counts range from 2,000 to 3,000 cells per square millimeter in healthy adults, so 2,378 is still within a safe range for most people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, for someone with a low cell count to start with, due to a previous eye surgery, infection, or disease, this loss could be riskier for their vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also discovered that these cells became less uniform after the vaccination, with their coefficient of variation - each cell's difference in size - increasing from 39 to 42.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When cells die, nearby cells stretch to fill the gaps, leading to bigger differences in size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could mean the endothelium is less healthy. If this trend continued for years, it could affect the cornea’s clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After vaccination, the study found fewer cells kept their healthy six-sided shape, with the total dropping from 50 to 48 percent of the cells in the eye.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Healthy endothelial cells are usually shaped like hexagons, which allows them to fit together tightly, like a honeycomb.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although the two-percent drop was not a direct sign of damage, it suggested to the team that the cells might be reacting to some sort of stress over those two months to three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers said their results also showed evidence that the changes had a high likelihood of being directly linked to taking the vaccine, meaning it wasn't just a random anomaly in the testing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If the signs of stress and inflammation drop off shortly after receiving the Pfizer shot, the impact of these minor changes would not be overly harmful. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A woman undergoes an eye exam. Scientists have found multiple signs of stress in the eye after taking the Pfizer COVID-19 shot (Stock Image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;To find these results, the team studied 128 eyes, 64 pairs in total, before each person received their COVID vaccinations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They followed up with the group approximately 75 days after they got their second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The team used a machine called Sirius corneal topography to measure the corneas' thickness and shape, and another device, the Tomey EM-4000 specular microscope, to take detailed pictures of the endothelial cells to check their number, size and shape.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Each participant also took a full eye exam, including tests for vision sharpness, eye pressure and scans of the eye’s front and back parts to ensure overall eye health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;By comparing the measurements taken before vaccination to those after, the researchers could see if the Pfizer vaccine was influencing the health of the eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The new data on potentially harmful side-effects linked to Pfizer's COVID vaccine added to a growing list of concerns the Trump Administration has highlighted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In May, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) forced Pfizer and Moderna to use &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14739333/trump-fda-covid-vaccine-pfizer-moderna-heart-damage.html"&gt;expanded warning labels&lt;/a&gt; about the risks of heart damage tied to COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The shots previously included warning labels about the rare chance of patients suffering myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis, inflammation of the sac-like lining surrounding the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new labels expanded that warning to certain age groups, particularly men between the ages of 16 and 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found that this seemingly healthy group appeared to be at the highest risk of the rare complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Young people appear to be increasingly vulnerable to gastrointestinal cancers, but researchers aren’t entirely sure what is driving the surge in disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a new study out this week, scientists led by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute found that rates of early-onset GI cancers—those occurring in people younger than 50—are rising more rapidly than other types of cancer. In particular, colorectal cancer cases have significantly increased, while rates of other forms of the disease, like stomach cancer, are creeping up, too. While the paper doesn’t come to definitive conclusions as to why these conditions are becoming more common, the researchers point to risk factors like obesity, a poor diet, and sedentary behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Colorectal cancer is the most common early-onset GI cancer worldwide, accounting for more than half of the cases, but it is not the only GI cancer that is rising in younger adults,” said senior study author Kimmie Ng, director of the Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber, in a &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/newsroom/news-releases/2025/global-rise-in-many-early-onset-gi-cancers-detailed-in-two-dana-farber-reviews-with-colorectal-cancer-leading-the-trend"&gt;statement.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, pancreatic, gastric, and esophageal cancers are also increasing in young people,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ng and her colleagues reviewed data collected from 100 studies, as well as past scientific reviews, and cancer-related guidelines. They also analyzed three publicly available cancer statistic databases.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Since 2010, the incidence of early-onset GI cancers has been increasing globally, they found, but especially in high-income countries like the U.S. Between 2010 and 2019, the age-adjusted incidence rate in the U.S. increased by 2.16% annually—the greatest increase of any early-onset cancer during that time. In 2022, there were at least 25,000 Americans under 50 who developed GI cancer. The team’s findings were &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2836671"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in JAMA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An earlier, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjs/article/112/7/znaf102/8191209?login=false#google_vignette"&gt;separate review of data&lt;/a&gt;—by some of the same authors—over a similar time period concluded that the rate of GI cancer has tripled in young people aged between 15 and 19, and almost doubled in those aged between 20 and 24.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The rising incidence of early-onset GI cancers is alarming and underscores the need for enhanced prevention strategies and early detection methods,” said Ng.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;As the rates of these cancers have risen, so have some of their risk factors, including rates of obesity and time spent sitting; ultraprocessed foods are also more common now, especially in Western diets. Still, the researchers estimate that as much as 30% of early-onset GI cancer may be linked to genetic mutations. Other scientists have argued that other issues, like &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/scientists-may-have-figured-out-why-young-people-are-getting-colorectal-cancer-more-often-2000594349"&gt;common stomach infections&lt;/a&gt;, could also be driving the increase in cancer rates.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even as the causes remain unclear, what is clear is that more work needs to be done to help catch these cancers early enough, before they become impossible to treat, the researchers said. In 2020, public health experts recommended routine screening for &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/45-is-the-new-50-when-it-comes-to-colorectal-cancer-scr-1845499824"&gt;colorectal cancer in people 45&lt;/a&gt; and up, but the researchers noted that a year later, fewer than 20% of people ages 45 to 49 went for a screening. Another outstanding question is whether early-onset GI cancers are different from those caught later in life, and if so, should they be treated differently.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“We need to be thinking not only about the risk factors for these diseases but also how to screen, diagnose, and treat young people with these cancers,” said Ng.&lt;/p&gt;

Whether it’s in the form of fruity shots or powdered supplements, this structural protein is being touted as the secret to youthful skin and glossy hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Celebrities are also singing the praises of a collagen-boosting procedure called NeoGen, with the actor &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMHolloi7P5/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Leslie Ash&lt;/a&gt; claiming earlier this week that it had “taken 10 years off her”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"fashion","tags":[{"id":"fashion/skincare","type":"Keyword","title":"Skincare"},{"id":"science/medical-research","type":"Keyword","title":"Medical research"},{"id":"fashion/beauty","type":"Keyword","title":"Beauty"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","type":"Keyword","title":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","type":"Keyword","title":"Health &amp;amp; wellbeing"},{"id":"science/science","type":"Keyword","title":"Science"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"profile/linda-geddes","type":"Contributor","title":"Linda Geddes"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"Main section"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"UK news"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-home-news","type":"Tracking","title":"UK Home News"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"fashion/2025/jul/18/do-collagen-shots-supplements-really-work-youthful-skin","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But amid the glowing endorsements and glossy marketing, a fundamental question remains: can anything else really boost collagen – and is it desirable to do so?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Collagens are a group of proteins that provide structural support and mechanical strength to the gel-like extracellular matrix in skin, cartilage and other body tissues. There are various types, each comprising long chains of amino acids that wind together to form strong fibres called fibrils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Viewed under an electron microscope, these fibrils form a basket-like mesh in young, healthy skin. But as we age, the amount of collagen declines and its structure becomes more cross-linked and fragmented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In younger skin, the fibres tend to be longer and more flexible, but in older skin, they’re shorter and more rigid, primarily as a result of UV damage,” said Prof John Connelly, who studies skin repair and regeneration at Queen Mary University of London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Collagen is not the only protein that keeps skin looking youthful. Elastin allows skin to stretch and spring back, while other structural proteins help to organise and stabilise collagen. Long sugar chains known as glycosaminoglycans – including the popular skincare ingredient hyaluronic acid – play a key role in hydrating&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the tissue. Like collagen, these components degrade and change with age, contributing to sagging, reduced plumpness and wrinkles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Yet collagen continues to dominate the spotlight. Many skincare products list it as an ingredient but “these proteins are very large, so they don’t easily cross the skin barrier when applied topically”, said &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/tanya-shaw" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Prof Tanya Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, a spokesperson for the British Skin Foundation and expert in wound healing at King’s College London. That said, collagen in creams may help draw moisture to the skin’s surface, providing a temporary plumping effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Collagen drinks are the latest plot twist. Their aim is to supply the raw materials for fibroblasts, the skin cells responsible for collagen production. There was also evidence that fragments of extracellular matrix proteins might act as signals, stimulating fibroblasts to produce not just collagen but also elastin and hyaluronic acid, said Dr Jonathan Kentley, a consultant dermatologist at the Montrose clinic in London and Chelsea and Westminster hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Most collagen supplements use fragments derived from chicken, fish or pork, which are absorbed through the gut and transported to the skin via the bloodstream. However, many are probably broken down further during digestion and it is unclear whether other&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;dietary proteins would offer similar building blocks, according to Connelly and Shaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Even if some fragments do reach the skin, they would be working in a damaged environment. “If you start to make new collagen, where does it go, and how does it interact with the existing collagen?” said &lt;a href="https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/michael.sherratt" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Dr Mike Sherratt&lt;/a&gt;, a skin mechanics expert at the University of Manchester. Also, “if it gets into the bloodstream, it’s not only going to affect the skin, but presumably other organs and tissues as well”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Animal studies offer some support for collagen supplements: radio-labelled collagen fragments have been shown to reach the skin and boost gene activity linked to collagen production in mice. “Mouse studies have also shown reduced wrinkle formation following UV exposure,” said Kentley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some human trials have also reported improved hydration, elasticity, and fewer wrinkles after consuming fish collagen. But most of these were industry-funded and a recent &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002934325002839#sec0015" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of 23 studies found that only those receiving funding from companies showed significant effects. Kentley said: “When the studies were separated into high-quality and low-quality studies, the high-quality studies showed no skin benefits. So, these results must be interpreted with extreme caution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;What about medical procedures such as NeoGen? It uses high-frequency radio waves to covert nitrogen gas into plasma (ionised gas), which delivers controlled heat to deeper layers of the skin. Animal studies suggest this controlled thermal damage alters collagen structure, causing skin tightening, and promotes the shedding of surface layers, improving tone and texture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Small clinical studies on patients have also shown an improvement in skin tone and wrinkling,” said Kentley. “However, as this is a relatively new technology there is relatively little evidence other than a handful of small studies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Other procedures such as microneedling also induce tiny, controlled injuries to the skin, triggering a wound healing response, while injectable “biostimulators” – such as Sculptra – create a foreign body response that stimulates fibroblasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While all these procedures have some clinical evidence supporting their ability to stimulate new collagen, the quality is variable and no head-to-head trials have pitted these products and procedures against each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kentley said: “Given that aesthetic medicine is so highly personalised and each product or procedure will have its own benefits and risks, the best way to know what is right for you is by seeing a qualified physician who is not conflicted by the quest for profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In terms of topical treatments, there are decades of evidence to support the use of tretinoin [a prescription-strength retinoid] to boost collagen production and reduce other signs of skin ageing such as pigmentation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although celebrity endorsements and dramatic before-and-after pictures can be persuasive, it is also worth remembering that these procedures are not a permanent fix for skin ageing – they require continuing treatments, which can be costly. The most effective long-term strategy to protect and preserve your collagen is to minimise UV exposure from an early age, through consistent use of sunscreen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Sherratt showed me a photo of him during &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/19/britain-heatwave-1976-crisis-summer-heat" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Britain’s 1976 heatwave&lt;/a&gt;, when he was nine. Unlike the proteins inside our cells that are regularly renewed, he said, type I collagen in the dermis had a half-life of about 15 years and elastin was thought to be meant to last a lifetime. “These proteins accumulate damage over time. So, it’s highly likely that some of the extracellular matrix proteins in my face and forearm still carry damage from that 1976 holiday.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For those of us who did not faithfully apply sunscreen in our youth, it is worth being realistic about how much even the most advanced treatments can achieve. While they may temporarily firm and smooth the skin, the deeper biological damage has already taken place – and much of it may be irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 14:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNOW1IVnhUN2s2emFOQnRPQnZMdWxZblhwTlN3VUtjTzlJNUVjQzVYRmkwTng5cG1WUzBMMWJxaVhob216b1hidTVSNE9Wel9KRW5xMGVFbVNLLXpXbGZKVG1lenFnYW5CLWk1SDF4cDE4OGJtNkcyYW5uZUloM2xJRDBzZlF4dnVWOGZ4NEVva3QzTzZ4ZnRtUjVPeVpTaW50T0VxTWxn</guid></item><item><title>湾区新冠肺炎疫情水平目前高于冬季高峰-伯克利赛德 | Bay Area COVID levels now higher than winter peak - Berkeleyside</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxOQVd2aUJoZkxRclBPTUw2bWZtRjJFSHFWNHEweFpZd281NHY5M0tvS0VwaXNlTzFRT3BWNlhYQlNMbzdWZ3hmc2FiTW5VaFhQd0Roa0RZTFB4VUxKSHNOR1QtM3Z4Mm1QUnhFczIxRFRyQjR6WHE4NzZMcGNSUFdBellKeXNjcFFta1FpcjdDOW1vZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it feels like several people you know are complaining of &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11954507/covid-symptoms-after-pride-how-to-find-test"&gt;feeling sick with what they assume is an “awful summer cold” — perhaps with a painful sore throat — &lt;/a&gt;there’s a good chance it could be COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 levels in Bay Area wastewater have now exceeded the winter peak, according to Stanford’s WastewaterSCAN team, which monitors coronavirus presence in human sewage. This also means Bay Area COVID-19 levels are rising faster than the statewide average. While coronavirus presence has increased 55% in California over the past three weeks, according to &lt;a href="https://skylab.cdph.ca.gov/calwws/"&gt;the California Department of Public Health’s wastewater tracking&lt;/a&gt;, those statewide numbers haven’t surpassed winter highs — as like they have in the Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rise is fueled in part by a new subvariant called NB.1.8.1, dubbed “Nimbus.” People who’ve been infected with this strain have also reported suffering a particularly nasty sore throat among their symptoms, earning this latest strain the unpleasant nickname “razor blade throat.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, what do you need to know about the symptoms of NB.1.8.1? What’s the COVID-19 incubation period in 2025, how long should you isolate and where can you still find a free COVID-19 test? And if you’re unfortunate enough to suffer “razor blade throat,” what can you do to ease your symptoms?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep reading for everything you need to know about the new Nimbus variant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-nb-1-8-1-and-is-it-worse-than-previous-variants"&gt;What is NB.1.8.1, and is it worse than previous variants?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, Nimbus is the most prevalent COVID-19 subvariant in the United States, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions"&gt; estimates currently makes up 43% of cases nationwide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nimbus is absolutely more transmissible — that is, more contagious and more easily caught — than previous variants, said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease expert at UCSF. That’s how a new variant ends up beating its siblings and “rising to the top of the charts,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s “no evidence that it causes more serious disease,” Chin-Hong said, echoing &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;the World Health Organization’s May briefing designating Nimbus a “variant under monitoring.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite this, NB.1.8.1 &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; still cause more people to go to the hospital with COVID-19, he said, “because if it’s fueling more people getting it, some of those people are going to be more vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-the-symptoms-of-the-new-nimbus-covid19-variant"&gt;What are the symptoms of the new Nimbus COVID-19 variant?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong confirmed that no surprising wild card symptoms have yet been reported for NB.1.8.1 — they’re the same COVID-19 symptoms you’re used to hearing about from previous variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the one symptom that doctors are hearing about from patients is the very painful throat that’s &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid19-sore-throat-razor-blade-vaccine-4688df53917022cb61204e08b41d5952"&gt;earned the unfortunate nickname “razor blade throat.”&lt;/a&gt; Or &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/1ldvned/new_razor_blade_throat_covid_subvariant_quickly/"&gt;as Reddit commenters have described it&lt;/a&gt;, “like being burned by acid whenever I ate or drank something” and “like my throat was coated in broken glass.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is Nimbus, a descendant of the omicron variant that first emerged in 2021, causing such sore throats? “I think omicron in general prioritizes the upper respiratory tract instead of the getting into the lungs as much,” Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8989396/"&gt;One 2022 study from the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; found that a higher proportion of patients — up to 70% of those studied — reported sore throats when infected with the omicron variant compared with earlier variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with previous variants to reach the Bay Area, Chin-Hong noted that more people also now appear to experience non-respiratory symptoms like diarrhea, nausea and vomiting when they get COVID-19 — gastrointestinal symptoms that folks can often initially dismiss as being unrelated to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/signs-symptoms/"&gt;this is the full list of the possible symptoms of COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fever or chills&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Fatigue&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Muscle or body aches&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;New loss of taste or smell&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sore throat&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Congestion or runny nose&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Nausea or vomiting&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Diarrhea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, you might have a combination of these symptoms or just one. They might be mild or feel more severe. But if you’re experiencing any of these, take a COVID-19 test (more on this below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ok-so-how-can-i-soothe-my-razor-blade-throat-if-im-infected"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;OK, so how can I soothe my ‘razor blade throat’ if I’m infected?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this kind of severe sore throat, it might be tempting to focus on topical medicine for your throat itself. But in general, systemic therapies — treatments which enter through your bloodstream, like Advil, and affect your whole body — “are better than topical ones,” Chin-Hong said. His recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ibuprofen and acetaminophen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ibuprofen (like Advil) is better than acetaminophen (like Tylenol) in this case, he said, although you should check with your health provider if you have other medical conditions which might make taking ibuprofen unsafe. If your throat hurts too much to swallow a pill, you can consider liquid versions of these drugs, but make sure you use the right dose depending on age, Chin-Hong said. And if you’re using a combination cold remedy like Nyquil, be aware it might already contain ibuprofen or acetaminophen — and be careful not to accidentally double-dose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic remedies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could try warm remedies like chicken soup, broth, lemon tea, honey or cold ones like popsicles, ice cream or ice chips. The upside of these treatments is the immediate relief they can bring, but they might also not last as long. You could also try gargling salt water, “which may loosen mucus” Chin-Hong said, or sucking lozenges with menthol or a mild anesthetic like benzocaine.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environmental treatments to try &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong also recommends:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay hydrated&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Get your rest&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Don’t smoke or expose yourself to smoke&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Consider a humidifier, as dryness may make your symptoms worse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you should consider seeking medical attention if your symptoms last longer than a week, if your sore throat is very severe, and if you begin drooling or become unable to eat or drink, Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-the-current-covid19-cases-in-the-bay-area-right-now"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What are the current COVID-19 cases in the Bay Area right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actual “COVID cases” — that is positive test results — are no longer tracked as closely by local and state public health bodies. In the absence of widespread up-to-date data on positive test results, monitoring the presence of the coronavirus in human sewage has become an increasingly important way to gauge the levels of COVID-19 spread in a particular area. This is because if you have COVID-19, &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/science/1963120/one-way-to-monitor-a-communitys-coronavirus-infections-raw-sewage"&gt;the virus will show up in your feces &lt;/a&gt;soon after you’re infected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite recent increases in COVID-19 levels in the Bay Area’s wastewater, “average concentrations are still lower than this time last year” when &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11987343/covid-bay-area-wastewater-variant-symptoms-isolation-guidance"&gt;the Bay Area experienced a summer surge, &lt;/a&gt;said Amanda Bidwell from Stanford’s WastewaterSCAN team. However, the Bay Area’s wastewater sites monitored by Stanford are currently in the “high” category, she told KQED on Monday, with a “statistically significant upward trend” in the last three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check the COVID-19 levels in your &lt;a href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/tracker/?charts=CkUQACABSABSBjVhYTY5OVIGMDJkMjQyUgZkZDM2ZmJSBjY3YzJlYlIGMjkzYjI1WgZOIEdlbmV40gGKAQY1OTRlYzPAAQE%3D&amp;amp;selectedChartId=594ec3"&gt;Alameda County’s wastewater&lt;/a&gt; according to WastewaterSCAN’s monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="is-the-latest-covid19-vaccine-still-effective-against-the-new-variant"&gt;Is the latest COVID-19 vaccine still effective against the new variant?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes: &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/12001396/where-can-i-get-new-covid-vaccine-near-me-2024"&gt;The COVID-19 vaccine that rolled out in August 2024 &lt;/a&gt;is effective against the NB.1.8.1 variant, Chin-Hong said. “It’s a descendant of JN.1, which all the last year’s vaccines were based on, which we still have around.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you didn’t &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/12001396/where-can-i-get-new-covid-vaccine-near-me-2024"&gt;get your COVID-19 shot in the fall, Chin-Hong has a message&lt;/a&gt;: Go get one now, particularly if you plan to travel abroad this summer. Not only will your protection last roughly a year, he said, “getting it now if it’s being paid for would help that person navigate through what we might see in the summer, but also later on in the year if rules change” — referring to the widespread uncertainty about &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-fda-kennedy-covid-shots-rfk-trump-bb4de15b6ff955d6cd0b406aaec3cdc5"&gt;how President Donald Trump’s administration might further change the U.S.’s vaccine policies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html"&gt;Currently, the CDC recommends the COVID-19 vaccine for most adults 18 and older&lt;/a&gt;, which means that most health insurance companies should cover the costs for people with insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="i-think-i-was-exposed-or-have-symptoms-when-should-i-take-a-covid19-test"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I think I was exposed or have symptoms. When should I take a COVID-19 test?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Know about updated incubation times for NB.1.8.1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve heard that incubation times for the virus are getting shorter — that is, the amount of time between getting exposed to COVID-19 and testing positive — it’s true. People are testing positive more quickly than they were in 2020, when the average incubation period was five to seven days, because it has changed with each new variant, Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three days is a common period of time between exposure and getting sick, Chin-Hong said, and given this trend, it makes sense to take a COVID-19 test as early as two days after exposure if you’re already having symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Don’t trust a negative early COVID-19 test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your first test is negative, you should absolutely test again the next day if symptoms persist — and again after that if you’re still negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s why you can’t necessarily trust a negative at-home COVID-19 test in 2025: While incubation times have gotten shorter, doctors are seeing people take longer to get a positive test, Chin-Hong said, and that’s probably more to do with how much quicker someone with COVID-19 might develop &lt;em&gt;symptoms&lt;/em&gt; in 2025 than they would have done in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, those symptoms are the sign that your body’s immune system is mounting a response to an invading virus. Back at the start of the pandemic, by the time you developed COVID-19 symptoms and took a test, it would probably already be positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at this stage of the pandemic, “we likely have more immune cells circulating that can recognize the enemy, so it ‘sounds the alarm’ quicker [and] people might feel something faster than in the old days,” Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Abraar Karan, an infectious disease physician and researcher at Stanford University, also put it this way for NPR in 2024: “With our immune systems primed, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2024/01/07/1222847727/coronavirus-faq-my-partner-roommate-kid-got-covid-and-i-didnt-how-come"&gt;the body’s response [now] comes much more quickly than it would have back in 2020&lt;/a&gt; when SARS-CoV-2 was a novel pathogen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because many of us take a COVID-19 test when we &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; to feel sick, we might actually be testing way too early for an at-home antigen kit to successfully detect enough virus inside us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line: If you’re testing because you’ve started feeling unwell, don’t assume a negative result means you don’t actually have COVID-19. Play it safe, stay home as much as you can and wear a well-fitted mask if you can’t. Take another antigen test 48 hours later, Chin-Hong said. You can also seek out a PCR test, which is more sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Make sure your COVID-19 test hasn’t expired&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those COVID-19 tests you might have in a drawer may be approaching their expiration date if they haven’t already passed it. And an expired test could give you an unreliable result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/home-otc-covid-19-diagnostic-tests#list"&gt;You can check the FDA’s list of antigen test types &lt;/a&gt;to see &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/home-otc-covid-19-diagnostic-tests#list"&gt;whether the box you’re holding has had its shelf life extended&lt;/a&gt; by the manufacturer. The FDA said that if a test’s shelf life has been extended, it’s because the manufacturer has given the agency enough “data showing that the shelf-life is longer than was known when the test was first authorized.” (In other words, it’s still OK to use that test.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another tip from Chin-Hong: “A quick and dirty way” to know if you’re using a functional COVID-19 test is to make sure the control line turns positive. If that doesn’t happen, “that means the test is probably not working,” he warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="if-i-test-positive-how-long-do-i-have-do-isolate-with-covid19-in-2025"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If I test positive, how long do I have do isolate with COVID-19 in 2025?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2024, the CDC officially revised their national COVID-19 isolation guidance, saying that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/p0301-respiratory-virus.html"&gt;COVID-positive people could now return to work or regular activities&lt;/a&gt; once “symptoms are improving overall” and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/precautions-when-sick.html"&gt;they’ve been fever-free for at least 24 hours&lt;/a&gt; without use of a fever-reducing medication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11973108/how-long-to-isolate-with-covid-in-2024-california-now-says-that-depends-on-symptoms"&gt;Read more about current isolation guidance for COVID-19.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been infected, consider asking your health provider for the COVID-19 medication &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11914514/if-you-get-covid-should-you-try-to-get-paxlovid-heres-how-with-or-without-health-insurance"&gt;Paxlovid, an antiviral treatment in pill form that is still available free by prescription in California. &lt;/a&gt;Read more on &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11914514/if-you-get-covid-should-you-try-to-get-paxlovid-heres-how-with-or-without-health-insurance"&gt;requesting a prescription for Paxlovid, with or without health insurance.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="where-can-inbspstillnbspfind-a-free-covid19-test"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Where can I &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; find a free COVID-19 test?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding a quick, free COVID-19 test — whether an at-home antigen test or a PCR test — has gotten progressively harder at this stage of the pandemic as more sites and services have been shuttered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And visiting &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/lab-leak-true-origins-of-covid-19/"&gt;the White House site that once offered you free at-home COVID-tests&lt;/a&gt; through USPS will now greet you with an image of Trump superimposed over the headline “LAB LEAK: The True Origins of COVID-19,” as well as &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/18/g-s1-61324/lab-leak-white-house-covid-origins"&gt;a page dedicated to the theory disputed by many scientists&lt;/a&gt; that the pandemic was caused by the coronavirus leaking from a government laboratory in Wuhan, China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what do you do now if you don’t already have a supply of antigen tests for COVID-19 at home right now? Try the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="purchase-a-covid19-athome-antigen-test-at-a-pharmacy-near-you"&gt;Purchase a COVID-19 at-home antigen test at a pharmacy near you&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quickest option will also be one of the most expensive up-front: Purchasing an at-home antigen test at a nearby pharmacy. (Ideally, ask someone to purchase one for you so you don’t potentially expose other people at the pharmacy, and if you really have to go yourself, wear a well-fitted N95 mask to help lower the risk you pose to others.) These at-home test kits are usually around $20 for a pack of two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have health insurance, you can &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11969300/how-to-get-reimbursed-for-at-home-covid-tests-in-2023"&gt;request reimbursement from your health insurer for the cost of up to eight at-home tests per month&lt;/a&gt;, so don’t throw away your receipts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="find-a-covid19-pcr-testing-site-near-you"&gt;Find a COVID-19 PCR testing site near you&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCR testing is more accurate than an antigen test. It’s more sensitive at picking up traces of the coronavirus in your body, but it may take longer to get your results than with an at-home test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are still some sites offering free COVID-19 testing around the state. Try visiting &lt;a href="https://myturn.ca.gov/testing.html"&gt;MyTurn.ca.gov/testing&lt;/a&gt; and applying the “Free Sites” filter from the drop-down menu. You can also find&lt;a href="https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/"&gt; a health center near you &lt;/a&gt;and ask if they offer COVID-19 testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://testinglocator.cdc.gov/Search"&gt;The CDC’s COVID-19 test locator&lt;/a&gt; is no longer operational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have health insurance, you may be able to get a PCR test ordered by your health care provider with the costs covered. Having a test ordered by a provider is — usually — the only way to get your testing costs covered if you have Medicare, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re insured through major Bay Area providers like Kaiser Permanente or Sutter Health, the easiest way to get a COVID-19 test may be to make an appointment through your provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most providers offer sign-ups online through a member login and appointments can also be made by phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In A Nutshell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A global study of 4,213 adults finds that people in wealthier countries actually burn &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; daily calories than those in traditional lifestyles.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Obesity in developed nations is not driven by inactivity but by increased intake, especially of ultra-processed foods.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Physical activity levels did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; significantly decline with economic development, challenging common obesity assumptions.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The percentage of ultra-processed food in the diet was strongly linked to higher body fat, suggesting food quality—not movement—is the key issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DURHAM, N.C. —&lt;/strong&gt; Americans burn more calories daily than people living traditional lifestyles in developing countries. Yet we’re also significantly fatter. How can that be?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Duke University study of 4,213 people spanning 34 populations worldwide — from Tanzanian hunter-gatherers to Norwegian office workers — shows that &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/weight-gain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;expanding waistlines&lt;/a&gt; have little to do with becoming less active. What we eat, not how much we move, is the real driver.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2420902122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, found that “daily energy expenditures are greater in developed populations, and activity energy expenditures are not reduced in more industrialized populations.” This directly challenges the common assumption that declining physical activity is the main cause of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/obesity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the authors write in the study’s significance section, these results “suggest that &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/food/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dietary intake &lt;/a&gt;plays a far greater role than reduced expenditure in the elevated prevalence of obesity associated with economic development.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-developed-countries-actually-burn-more-daily-calories"&gt;Developed Countries Actually Burn More Daily Calories&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To measure how many calories people actually burn each day, the researchers used a technique called “doubly labeled water,” which tracks how quickly the body processes certain harmless isotopes over 7 to 14 days. It’s considered the most accurate method available for measuring total energy expenditure in real-world settings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the study found that people in more economically developed countries &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/fitness-trackers-fitbit-calories-inaccurate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;burned more&lt;/a&gt; calories per day than those in less developed ones. This wasn’t just because they were taller or heavier, though body size did explain part of the difference. Even after adjusting for weight and muscle mass, the difference in calories burned was modest, only about 6%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also expected to see lower &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/effects-sitting-offset-by-30-minutes-exercise/"&gt;physical activity levels&lt;/a&gt; in wealthier nations, but that wasn’t the case. Across all 34 populations studied, people in industrialized societies were just as physically active as those in traditional or rural settings. There was “no significant change” in physical activity levels with economic development, meaning people across different lifestyles generally moved their bodies just as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-ultra-processed-foods-drive-weight-gain"&gt;How Ultra-Processed Foods Drive Weight Gain&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The real difference between countries wasn’t how much people moved. It was what they ate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the 25 populations where dietary data were available, one trend stood out clearly: the more &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/ultra-processed-food/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; people consumed, the more body fat they tended to carry. These foods — like &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sugary-drinks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sugary drinks&lt;/a&gt;, packaged snacks, and ready-to-eat meals — are industrially made and often contain long lists of ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, one likely explanation is that these foods are easier to digest, which means the body absorbs more calories from them. Less energy is lost during digestion, and more gets stored. Some studies suggest these foods may also interfere with the body’s hunger signals, causing people to eat more than they need.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even though people in wealthier countries were burning more calories, they were also eating more; and not just more food overall, but more food that seems to encourage &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/fat-around-muscles-deadlier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;fat storage&lt;/a&gt;. Because participants in the study maintained a stable weight during the measurement period, the researchers were able to infer that calorie intake must have closely matched calorie expenditure at the time. That means the high calorie burn in developed countries is matched by equally high consumption, likely driven by food quality rather than quantity alone&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-fighting-obesity"&gt;What This Means for Fighting Obesity&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasize that physical activity is still vital for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/wellness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;overall health&lt;/a&gt;. It lowers the risk of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/heart-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, improves &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental well-being&lt;/a&gt;, and helps maintain a &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/metabolism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthy metabolism&lt;/a&gt;. But when it comes specifically to obesity, the biggest factor appears to be the kind of food people eat, not how much they move.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study also found that much of the increase in body mass in wealthier countries came from muscle and lean tissue, not just fat. In other words, better access to nutrition helps support healthy growth, even as it contributes to weight gain. Still, body fat increased more than &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/muscle-mass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle mass&lt;/a&gt;, pointing to a mismatch between calorie intake and the body’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What stood out most was this: the differences in body fat between rich and poor countries were about 10 times greater than any differences linked to how many calories people burned. That’s a powerful argument for focusing on the food environment — what’s available, affordable, and marketed to people — rather than just telling individuals to exercise more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, public health campaigns have leaned on the slogan “eat less, move more.” This study suggests it’s time to shift focus. The root of the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/obesity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;obesity crisis&lt;/a&gt; may not be laziness, but the global rise of ultra-processed foods that are cheap, convenient, and engineered to be overeaten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; This study is observational and cross-sectional, meaning it cannot establish cause-and-effect relationships. While the data strongly support associations between economic development, ultra-processed food consumption, and obesity, the authors note that more research is needed to clarify the underlying physiological and environmental mechanisms. Additionally, dietary data were only available for a subset of populations. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-group has-quaternary-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed data from 4,213 adults aged 18–60 across 34 populations representing different levels of economic development, from hunter-gatherers to industrialized societies. They used the doubly labeled water method, considered the gold standard for measuring energy expenditure, which tracks isotope depletion in body water over 7–14 days to calculate total daily calories burned. Body composition was measured using deuterium dilution to determine fat-free mass, fat mass, and body fat percentage. Economic development was categorized using the UN Human Development Index, which incorporates measures of wealth, education, and life expectancy. The study also examined dietary data from 25 populations, including the percentage of ultra-processed foods in people’s diets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Body fat percentage and obesity rates increased significantly with economic development across all populations studied. However, total daily energy expenditure was actually higher in more developed countries, primarily due to larger body sizes. When adjusted for body size, energy expenditure decreased only modestly (6–11%) with development, and this small difference could explain only about one-tenth of the obesity differences between populations. Surprisingly, physical activity energy expenditure showed no significant decline with economic development. Among populations with dietary data, the percentage of ultra-processed foods in the diet was positively correlated with body fat percentage, demonstrating that dietary intake rather than reduced energy expenditure drives obesity in developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study used cross-sectional data, making it impossible to establish causality in the relationships between economic development, diet, and obesity. Detailed dietary information was available for only 25 of the 34 populations studied. The research could not identify specific environmental, social, or physiological factors that promote increased calorie intake and absorption in developed settings. Some energy expenditure measurements used estimated rather than directly measured basal metabolic rates. The study also couldn’t resolve whether differences in food quality, quantity, digestibility, or other factors drive the dietary effects observed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-funding-and-disclosures"&gt;Funding and Disclosures&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study was supported by multiple funding sources including the US National Science Foundation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, International Atomic Energy Agency, and various other research institutions.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A healthy diet and lifestyle can have a positive impact on our brain health. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yet, many of our day-to-day habits can silently chip away at our cognitive health. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These include an unbalanced diet, lack of sleep, drinking alcohol, social media and smoking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your brain is nothing short of extraordinary. It’s the epicenter of everything you think, feel and do. Whether you’re solving a tough problem, laughing with friends or remembering your favorite song, your brain is hard at work behind the scenes, orchestrating every moment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As important as our brains are, it’s all too easy to overlook the everyday habits that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-are-aging-your-brain-11717608" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;quietly undermine brain health&lt;/a&gt;. Some of these are so common that we barely notice them.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, we spoke with neuroscientist &lt;a href="http://www.manifestwellness.co" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jamey Maniscalco, Ph.D&lt;/a&gt;, to find out which of these habits to look out for. Here are the top six under-the-radar habits he says could be harming your brain health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-missing-out-on-sleep"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Missing Out on Sleep  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “We all know that sleep is important, but many of us don’t recognize that it’s absolutely vital for brain health,” says Maniscalco. “Sleep isn’t just rest. It’s a highly active process during which your brain performs critical housekeeping, emotional processing and memory consolidation.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Sleep is also when your brain purges itself of harmful waste products that build up during your waking hours.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chronic sleep deprivation may even raise the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7909431/have-a-family-history-of-dementia-or-alzheimers-heres-how-to-protect-your-brain-as-you-age/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;risk of Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. One suspected reason is that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-if-you-dont-get-enough-sleep-11746534" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;insufficient sleep&lt;/a&gt; disrupts the brain’s ability to clear out beta-amyloid, a toxic protein that builds up in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For instance, one study that followed nearly 8,000 people for more than 25 years found that those who routinely slept six hours or less per night during their 50s, 60s and 70s were significantly more likely to develop dementia than those who logged seven hours of sleep.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To protect your brain health, prioritize seven to nine hours of consistent sleep nightly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-smoking"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Smoking  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Smoking isn’t just damaging to the heart and lungs; it can also have serious, often overlooked consequences for brain health,” says Maniscalco. “Cigarette smoke contains thousands of harmful chemicals, many of which cross the blood-brain barrier and contribute directly to oxidative stress and chronic inflammation in brain tissue.” Over time, this may accelerate the breakdown of neurons and their supporting structures, which can lead to measurable changes in the brain’s structure and function.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That may be why research has found a strong correlation between smoking and an increased risk of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; According to the American Heart Association, smoking can raise the risk of dementia by 30%, and it can boost the odds of Alzheimer’s disease by 40%. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fortunately, quitting smoking can reduce this risk substantially. Support programs, nicotine replacement therapies and professional counseling are excellent resources to help you kick the habit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-drinking-alcohol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Drinking Alcohol  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking alcohol, even in small amounts, may harm your brain’s structure and health. One study of more than 36,000 middle-aged and older adults found that regular alcohol consumption was linked to reduced brain volume, loss of gray matter and damage to white matter. This may impair communication within the brain. Surprisingly, declines in grey and white matter volume were noticeable even in people who drank as little as one alcoholic drink a day. And the more alcohol a person drank, the more harmful its effects.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What makes alcohol so problematic? “Alcohol is both a central nervous system depressant and a neurotoxin,” says Maniscalco. “This means it slows down brain activity by dampening communication between neurons and, at higher levels or with chronic use, it can damage or even kill brain cells.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We’re not saying that you need to give up alcohol entirely. But if you do drink, try to stick with the recommended guidelines of no more than one drink per day for women and two for men. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-skimping-on-healthy-foods"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Skimping on Healthy Foods &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Your brain is one of the most metabolically active organs in the body. It uses over 20% of your daily energy intake despite making up just about 2% of your body weight,” says Maniscalco. “That means what you eat doesn’t just affect your body composition, it directly impacts your ability to regulate your mood, memory, focus and even emotional resilience.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Feeding your brain a wide variety of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290550/10-everyday-superfoods/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nutrient-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; may help it function at its best. The link between &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7911108/best-and-worst-foods-for-brain-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;nutrition and brain health&lt;/a&gt; is so strong that research has found that an eating pattern rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and fish may promote greater brain volume and protect against cognitive decline. Conversely, people whose diets are highest in ultra-processed foods may experience cognitive decline considerably sooner than people who rarely eat these foods.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-doing-the-same-thing-all-the-time"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Doing the Same Thing All the Time &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The brain craves novelty. It’s wired to respond to new experiences, challenges and learning opportunities, since these inputs stimulate growth, adaptation to new environments and long-term resilience,” says Maniscalco. “Without regular exposure to novelty, we risk falling into patterns of mental autopilot, where the brain’s most dynamic systems that are responsible for attention, problem-solving, memory and creativity go underused.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Social media may seem like harmless entertainment or a convenient way to stay connected, but it can significantly reshape the way your brain functions,” says Maniscalco. “Platforms like Instagram, TikTok and Facebook are designed to trigger and exploit the brain’s dopamine system—the same reward circuitry involved in motivation, craving and addiction.” Over time, this can lead to negative consequences for your brain health.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One review of multiple studies found that people who had difficulty controlling their internet use tended to have less gray matter in brain regions related to decision-making, self-control and reward processing.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Too much social media can also affect emotional well-being. For instance, research has found that using social media as a primary means of maintaining relationships is linked to feelings of loneliness.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

A study using high-density EEG recordings found that awakening begins in frontal regions and spreads backward, with distinct patterns depending on whether you wake from REM or non-REM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In non-REM sleep, slower waves precede faster wake-like activity, while REM sleep skips directly to wakefulness. These findings shed light on why we sometimes feel alert and other times groggy, with implications for understanding and treating sleep disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sequential Awakening:&lt;/strong&gt; Brain activity moves from frontal to posterior regions during waking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REM vs. Non-REM:&lt;/strong&gt; REM sleep leads to immediate fast activity; non-REM shows slower transitions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleepiness Clues:&lt;/strong&gt; Certain slow waves before waking can improve alertness, while others worsen it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;KNAW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Each morning, your brain embarks on a remarkable series of events: it transitions from being asleep, potentially in an alternate reality, to waking up. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within a short time, you regain waking consciousness, reorient yourself and reconnect with your surroundings, becoming ready to interact with the world again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how does your brain accomplish this transition so safely and efficiently?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt; &lt;iframe title="Reassembling Consciousness: How the Brain Transitions from Sleep to Wake" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9jscYdR4l34?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Neuroscience" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand the awakening brain, researchers from the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience and the University of Lausanne analysed over 1,000 awakenings using high-density EEG recordings on a second-by-second basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;Current Biology,&lt;/em&gt; reveals that the brain doesn’t wake up all at once. Instead, it orchestrates a precise sequence of activation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving waves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers worked with high-density EEG-data, which offers information about the time and location of brain activity. When looking at the activity progression throughout the awakening brain, they observed a clear sequence: it starts in central and frontal brain regions and gradually spreads toward the back of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aurélie Stephan, first author, is not surprised by this sequence of events: “This progression likely reflects how signals from subcortical arousal centres (deeper in the brain) reach the cortex, with shorter paths to frontal areas and longer ones toward regions further back”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep Stages: REM vs non-REM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand how the brain navigates waking up at any moment, the researchers specifically studied awakening patterns in two stages: REM sleep, commonly associated with vivid dreams, and non-REM sleep, also known as deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When participants awoke from non-REM sleep, their brain activity first showed a brief surge in slower sleep-like waves immediately followed by faster activity related to wakefulness. When participants awoke from REM sleep, the slower waves were skipped, leading to a more direct boost in faster brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The brain responds differently to arousing signals depending on the stage it’s in”, Stephan explains. “In non-REM sleep, neurons that connect arousal centres to the cortex alternate between states of activity and silence – a dynamic known as “bistability”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of this bistability, any arousing stimulus first triggers a slow wave, before transitioning to faster activity. In contrast, REM sleep does not have this bistable pattern, so the cortex immediately responds with the fast, wake-like, activity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding sleepiness and sleep-disorders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also investigated how sleepy a participant felt when they woke up. While participants felt the sleepiest when awoken from REM sleep, Stephan is most intrigued by the impact of the slow waves in non-REM sleep stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found a new aspect in which slow waves can present very distinct and opposite behaviours. Some slow waves are actually acting like arousal elements – they are part of the “wake up!” signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more these waves occur just before awakening, the more alert you tend to feel upon awakening. While the other slow waves – whether they are present before waking up or persisting after – are the reason we sometimes feel so sleepy in the first moments of the day”, Stephan explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephan hopes these findings can be used for future research into sleep disorders, such as insomnia or conditions involving incomplete awakenings. “If we understand the process more, we can also better identify signs of hyperarousal in sleep disorders”, she concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Stephan is excited about the future avenues. “This study provides a new perspective looks at the brain’s journey from sleep to wakefulness yet, offering a window into one of the most fundamental transitions in human consciousness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep, consciousness, and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f396dd9596969d80878192b39d9a9ddd989d9284dd9d9f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eline Feenstra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nin.knaw.nl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;KNAW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Eline Feenstra – KNAW&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2025.06.064" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cortical activity upon awakening from sleep reveals consistent spatio-temporal gradients across sleep stages in human EEG&lt;/a&gt;” by Aurélie Stephan et al. &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cortical activity upon awakening from sleep reveals consistent spatio-temporal gradients across sleep stages in human EEG&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does the brain awaken from sleep?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several studies have suggested that the awakening process occurs asynchronously across brain regions, but the precise nature of these changes and how they are reflected in human electroencephalography (EEG) remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we recorded 1,073 awakenings and arousals with high-density EEG and mapped brain activity at a second-to-second timescale around movement onset using source modeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that cortical activity upon awakening progressed along highly consistent spatial and frequency gradients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In awakenings and arousals from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, transient increases in low-frequency power preceded increases in high-frequency power by a few seconds, whereas awakenings from REM sleep were mainly characterized by increases in high-frequency power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of sleep stage, high-frequency changes were first seen in frontal and last in occipital and inferior-temporal cortical areas, whereas low-frequency changes in NREM sleep started in a centro-parietal “hotspot,” progressed frontally, and reached occipital and inferior-temporal regions last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the presence of these spatio-temporal arousal patterns during sleep, before participants were awakened by sounds, was followed by lower sleepiness ratings upon awakening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results indicate a consistent spatio-temporal EEG signature of the awakening process that likely reflects the structural organization of arousal systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, a transient increase in slow EEG frequencies, which are normally associated with sleep, is inherent to the arousal process and functionally correlates with feeling more awake when awakening from NREM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings have important implications for the interpretation of arousal signals and the detection of incomplete awakenings in sleep disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an exciting development for both the energy and nuclear industries, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.radiantnuclear.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Radiant Industries Inc.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a California-based startup, is preparing to test its groundbreaking &lt;strong&gt;1-megawatt Kaleidos microreactor&lt;/strong&gt; in 2026, according to&lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/energy/worlds-first-mass-produced-nuclear-reactor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Interesting Engineering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The reactor is poised to play a major role in revolutionizing how we think about&lt;strong&gt; power generation&lt;/strong&gt; in remote, off-grid locations. This major step forward follows a significant financial boost, with Radiant raising &lt;strong&gt;$165 million&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Series C funding&lt;/strong&gt;, bringing its total capital raised to&lt;strong&gt; $225 million&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A New Era for Nuclear Power&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the idea of a &lt;strong&gt;portable nuclear reactor&lt;/strong&gt; might seem like science fiction. But Kaleidos, designed for modularity and rapid deployment, offers a new and practical solution to power delivery in regions where traditional energy infrastructure is scarce or non-existent. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Powered by a &lt;strong&gt;helium gas-cooling&lt;/strong&gt; design, this microreactor eliminates the need for &lt;strong&gt;water-based cooling systems&lt;/strong&gt;, which not only improves its reliability in challenging environments but also simplifies its logistics. It’s precisely this combination of innovative design and adaptability that has drawn the attention of investors and government bodies alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The Kaleidos reactor’s versatility is particularly noteworthy. It’s not just another piece of &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/04/this-chinese-technology-is-beyond-imagination-faster-than-an-airplane-and-already-tested/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="84949" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cutting-edge technology&lt;/a&gt;; it’s built with a clear purpose in mind—providing consistent and reliable power where it’s needed most. Whether it’s deployed in a remote settlement, a military forward operating base, or a disaster-stricken region, the microreactor promises to fill the energy gap where conventional methods can’t reach.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="" alt="Rendering of the Radiant Kaleidos microreactor." data-lazy-src="https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iuEV4xZmLdUg/v1/-1x-1.webp"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iuEV4xZmLdUg/v1/-1x-1.webp" alt="Rendering of the Radiant Kaleidos microreactor."&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Rendering of the Radiant Kaleidos microreactor. &lt;em&gt;Credit: US Department of Energy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Federal Support and Strategic Partnerships&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The potential of Kaleidos has caught the eye of both the private sector and government entities. Recently, Radiant secured backing from the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)&lt;/strong&gt;, which has agreed to supply the company with &lt;strong&gt;high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU)&lt;/strong&gt; for the first reactor test. This move underscores the increasing federal support for &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/nuclear-thermal-propulsion-reactor-fuel-that-could-take-humans-to-mars-tested-at-nasa-facility/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="76695" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;next-generation nuclear technologies,&lt;/a&gt; which are becoming a critical part of the U.S. energy strategy—especially in the context of national security and defense.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;DOE’s&lt;/strong&gt; involvement is a pivotal moment for Radiant, and it’s no surprise that the company has garnered significant backing from investors such as &lt;strong&gt;Andreessen Horowitz&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Chevron Technology Ventures&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Founders Fund&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. These investors are betting that Radiant’s approach to nuclear power could usher in a new wave of energy innovation that aligns with both climate goals and national security priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What Makes Kaleidos Stand Out?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, what exactly sets Kaleidos apart from traditional reactors? The answer lies in its design. Unlike conventional nuclear reactors that rely heavily on water for cooling, &lt;strong&gt;Kaleidos&lt;/strong&gt; uses helium gas, a feature that gives it a distinct edge. This makes the microreactor more suitable for challenging environments, such as military bases or disaster zones, where access to water may be limited.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The reactor is also designed with a &lt;strong&gt;passive safety architecture&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning that it can continue to operate safely even if certain systems fail. This added level of security is a key selling point for those considering the reactor for deployment in high-risk or unpredictable environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another standout feature of the Kaleidos is its &lt;strong&gt;ease of transport&lt;/strong&gt;. The system is designed to be &lt;strong&gt;air&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;road&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;sea transportable&lt;/strong&gt;, making it an ideal candidate for rapid deployment in emergency situations or to regions that are in urgent need of power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

            This death might bring to mind the bubonic plague, the form of the plague that killed &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.clevelandclinic.org%2Fhealth%2Fdiseases%2F21590-bubonic-plague&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C56b895ea96eb4de6f08c08ddc4aa421b%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638882957727378234%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=Y83aweM5Rmp%2F3mKY68Q7OxFVrRcrd8%2BSu6v2nXC5L8I%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;millions during the Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;. This latest case is not the same form, and treatments have certainly advanced since that time. That said, I wanted to know what pneumonic plague is, how it’s spread and what its symptoms are. How is it diagnosed, and what treatments are available? What can people do to reduce the risk of contracting the disease? And how much should people be worried about plague?
    &lt;/p&gt;

            To help with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner.

            &lt;strong&gt;Dr.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Leana Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Pneumonic plague is one of three types of plagues that are caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. The &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.clevelandclinic.org%2Fhealth%2Fdiseases%2F17782-plague&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C56b895ea96eb4de6f08c08ddc4aa421b%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638882957727398100%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=2eS3FL1Pz26EPW3LnYfIENdL%2FCkJwl1vgUkYjcPVL4Y%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;type of plague&lt;/a&gt; someone has is classified based on where the bacteria are concentrated. Bubonic plague infects lymph nodes. Septicemic plague is when the bacteria cause a whole-body infection through the bloodstream, and pneumonic plague affects the lungs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6im98l000r3b6norxbp95n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How does someone contract plague? Can it be spread from person to person?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6iorqt000y3b6nylafreuw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; It depends on the type of plague. Bubonic plague is typically caused by the bite of an infected &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2024%2F07%2F05%2Fhealth%2Fplague-human-risk-explainer%2Findex.html&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C56b895ea96eb4de6f08c08ddc4aa421b%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638882957727415565%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=frtW1Y%2BLSAgysz6NOX%2B6kwGgdGKL9XWiAuZw8Dp2wHY%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;rodent flea&lt;/a&gt;. It can progress to septicemic plague, which can also arise as a result of handling infected animals such as rats and cats. Cats and other animals can contract the plague through eating rodents or through the bite of fleas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6iorqt000z3b6n907743m2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pneumonic plague develops when the bacteria spread to the lungs in someone who started out with bubonic or septicemic plague. It can also occur when the bacteria are directly transmitted through airborne droplets — if someone inhales droplets containing the Yersinia bacteria that are coughed by an infected person or animal. This is the only form of the plague that can be spread from person to person.

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; People infected with all three forms develop common infectious symptoms including fever, headache, chills and weakness. Those with bubonic plague have one or more swollen and painful lymph nodes, also called buboes. In septicemic plague, the seeding of bacteria to other parts of the body can cause multi-organ failure and total body shock. Pneumonic plague is characterized by a rapidly progressing pneumonia with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough and chest pain.

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Most Americans do not live in areas where plague can be found. For those in Western US states where plague has occurred, there are &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coconino.az.gov%2FCivicAlerts.aspx%3FAID%3D3242%26fbclid%3DIwY2xjawLfXHRleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFCd3hlUjY2M1ZGNURMRFdFAR5cdhAbD4Nab71-FQNNDDI_CXVgccQw2SMLR5OknCEoxkTUi1wDajEe0TzLvQ_aem_WYG09QZujnbgF13qssTFqQ&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C56b895ea96eb4de6f08c08ddc4aa421b%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638882957727620660%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=2f%2BipoOjDDGfhrUOB2Y0XQJ4V5mx4g2QvV3fkTY5KEI%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;several actions&lt;/a&gt; they can take to reduce their potential exposure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6irnq2001m3b6nh9fpncjg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            First, avoid contact with wild animals. Do not handle wild rodents. Do not touch sick or dead animals.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6irnq2001n3b6nplcoduve@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Second, because most cases are associated with rodents, people should prevent rodent infestation by storing pet food in rodent-proof containers and removing brush and trash around homes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6irnq2001o3b6n5wz990i4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Third, avoid fleabites. Wear long sleeves and use insect repellent containing DEET if you are hiking, camping or working outdoors. Keep fleas away from household pets by using veterinarian-approved flea control products.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6irnq2001p3b6nmtk0tvv8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fourth, keep pets out of areas known to be inhabited by wild rodents. Be on the outlook for illnesses in domestic animals, especially indoor-outdoor cats, and seek prompt veterinary care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6irnq2001q3b6njo0zl5rc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All of this said, I think it’s important to be reminded of how uncommon plague is. People who live in areas where plague has been found should take preventive measures, and clinicians should ask about travel history to these areas. Most Americans, though, do not need to be concerned about plague based on this single recent case in Arizona.
    &lt;/p&gt;

They’re&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/upshot/boys-falling-behind-data.html"&gt; falling behind women academically&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://generations.org/tabs/none/podcasts/41186"&gt;making less money &lt;/a&gt;than their dads and grandfathers, and are so desperate for kinship and community that they’ve started &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/23/nx-s1-5260230/stick-nation-sticktok"&gt;posting sticks on Instagram and asking each other to rank them&lt;/a&gt;. It’s tough out there, and now that the weather is heating up, it’s about to get tougher.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmd64z9rn000g3b78l9gjnv2c@published" data-word-count="83"&gt;A man told me something a few years ago that haunts me to this day: every summer, his balls get bigger. Not to the extent that he has to purchase &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2013/12/underwear-company-to-men-get-on-womens-level.html"&gt;new underwear &lt;/a&gt;or anything, but enough to make a noticeable difference when he wears trunks or loose boxers. Every June or so, like clockwork, his “summer long balls” come in. It’s one of the harbingers of summer, sort of like a collie shedding its top coat or &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/why-are-people-mad-sabrina-carpenter-album-cover.html"&gt;Sabrina Carpenter releasing a new single.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmd64z9tm000h3b789q50rbiv@published" data-word-count="73"&gt;This guy says he doesn’t have strong feelings about his Summer Long Balls. “It’s not something I either like or dislike,” he said. “It is simply a reality.” But I don’t think he’s being entirely truthful. I’ve gone to the beach with him, and on at least one occasion, he had to find a Target en route and duck into the bathroom to self-adjust because his balls had gotten twisted in his trunks.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmd64z9vc000i3b785l79gygw@published" data-word-count="83"&gt;I had to know if this condition was specific to this one man, or if it was something that all men struggled with but  just didn’t talk about publicly. When I asked around my social circle, about half the men I polled didn’t know what the hell I was talking about. Others, however, acutely felt the pain of summer long balls. “It sucks,” one person told me. “I wish I could wear sluttier shorts in the summer. But I can’t do so comfortably.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmd64z9x1000j3b78e8ewmcrm@published" data-word-count="77"&gt;Another told me he experiences a variation on summer long balls in which sweat causes the skin from his scrotum to stick to his leg, creating what he dubs a “bat wing” effect. “You have to make sure no one sees you grab your crotch to rearrange if you’re in public,” he says. I even heard about a guy whose testicles were so distended they hit the toilet water when he sat down in a public restroom.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmd64z9ys000k3b78427bcsa9@published" data-word-count="53"&gt;Some pointed out the similarity to “&lt;a href="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/summer-penis-is-real-and-its-spectacular"&gt;summer penis&lt;/a&gt;,” the term coined by MEL Magazine’s Tracy Moore in 2018 to describe the way some men’s genitals appear to swell during the summer. This phenomenon, Moore writes, is caused by vasodilation, or the dilation of blood vessels to allow for increased flow to erectile tissue.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmd64za0l000l3b78j1t58rqt@published" data-word-count="99"&gt;But this is not the case for summer long balls, according to New Jersey urologist Anika Ackerman, which instead result from body self-regulating in warmer climates, so the testicles are at optimal temperature for sperm production. “When it’s a cold environment, the testicles move towards the body, and the scrotum tenses up,” Ackerman explained. (Think: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsH4aClj-ZY"&gt;George Costanza’s shrinkage incident&lt;/a&gt;.) “The opposite is true in a warm environment. The scrotum relaxes and the testicles move away from the body.” It’s not so much that men’s testicles become bigger in the heat; it’s that they travel further away from the body.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmd64za2f000m3b78dgn7lwk3@published" data-word-count="119"&gt;Still, the question remained: why do some men clearly experience summer long balls, while others don’t? And approximately what percentage of the male population is at risk, so to speak? I called Yaniv Larish, a urologist and surgeon at Fifth Avenue Urology, to see if he had any &lt;a href="http://theories.he"&gt;theories.&lt;/a&gt; He suspects that a good proportion of summer long ball cases are actually men with varicoceles, or enlarged veins within the scrotum. (Which is basically like varicose veins, but for your ballsack.) “When you have a varicocele, the blood is not moving around efficiently, so instead of circulating around the testicle and pulling the heat away, it’s pooling up and actually insulating the testicle at an elevated temperature,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmd64za8a000n3b783ao58qj5@published" data-word-count="82"&gt;About 15 percent of the male population has a varicocele in either one or both testicles. They’re often undiagnosed, because “men are way less educated about their bodies than women are,” Lavish says Varicoceles are usually harmless, but in some cases they can be linked to decreased fertility, in which case they are treated with minor surgery. “What you’re describing as summer long balls is, I suspect, really the varicocele becoming more pronounced as a result of the elevated temperature,” Larish says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmd64zaah000o3b78frnp4x3b@published" data-word-count="95"&gt;If a man in your life is struggling with summer long balls, there are a few things he can do to alleviate his discomfort. Wearing tight underwear, for instance, can offer scrotal support; it’s also helpful to spend as much time in the air-conditioned indoors as possible, as hotter environments aren’t great for testicular health overall. Ackerman also told me about a product called &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vasectomy-Ice-Pack-Underwear-Inserts/dp/B09SQH4J81?tag=thecutonsite-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=__c20718aam__cmd64qiqz00000if9xx84wbm1__________________" rel="sponsored,nofollow" data-track-type="product-link"&gt;“Nutsicles”&lt;/a&gt; — essentially, an ice pack for the testicles — that could possibly help, though it is intended primarily for men who have had vastectomies and not Summer Long Ball sufferers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmd64zac5000p3b78o48swvqv@published" data-word-count="98"&gt;While there is no hard-and-fast cure for Summer Long Balls, the good news is that it’s temporary. Once the temperature goes down, so, too, will the circumference of a man’s balls. Men can also take solace in the fact that summer long balls can provide, if nothing else, a new opportunity for creative expression. “Actually, I think they’re kind of awesome,” a friend told me. “When they’re hanging way the heck down you can really grab a handful of them and twist them around, or pull them up to do a bullfrog.” Who says men don’t have hobbies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;An experimental mRNA vaccine has boosted the tumor-fighting effects of immunotherapy in a mouse-model study, bringing researchers one step closer to their goal of developing a universal vaccine to "wake up" the immune system against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;i&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/i&gt;, the University of Florida study showed that like a one-two punch, pairing the test vaccine with common anticancer drugs called &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+checkpoint+inhibitors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune checkpoint inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; triggered a strong antitumor response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A surprising element, researchers said, was that they achieved the promising results not by attacking a specific target protein expressed in the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/tumor/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tumor&lt;/a&gt;, but by simply revving up the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;—spurring it to respond as if fighting a virus. They did this by stimulating the expression of a protein called PD-L1 inside of tumors, making them more receptive to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior author Elias Sayour, M.D., Ph.D., a UF Health pediatric oncologist, said the results reveal a potential new treatment path—an alternative to surgery, radiation and chemotherapy—with broad implications for battling many types of treatment-resistant tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This paper describes a very unexpected and exciting observation: that even a vaccine not specific to any particular tumor or virus—so long as it is an mRNA vaccine—could lead to tumor-specific effects," said Sayour, principal investigator at the RNA Engineering Laboratory within UF's Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"This finding is a proof of concept that these vaccines potentially could be commercialized as universal cancer vaccines to sensitize the immune system against a patient's individual tumor," said Sayour, a McKnight Brain Institute investigator and co-leader of a program in immuno-oncology and microbiome research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, there have been two main ideas in cancer-vaccine development: to find a specific target expressed in many people with cancer, or to tailor a vaccine that is specific to targets expressed within a patient's own cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This study suggests a third emerging paradigm," said Duane Mitchell, M.D., Ph.D., a co-author of the paper. "What we found is by using a vaccine designed not to target cancer specifically but rather to stimulate a strong immunologic response, we could elicit a very strong anticancer reaction. And so this has significant potential to be used broadly in cancer patients—even possibly leading us to an off-the-shelf cancer vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than eight years, Sayour has pioneered high-tech anticancer vaccines by combining lipid nanoparticles and mRNA. Short for messenger RNA, mRNA is found inside every cell—including tumor cells—and serves as a blueprint for protein production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new study builds upon a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-05-mrna-cancer-vaccine-triggers-fierce.html"&gt;breakthrough&lt;/a&gt; last year by Sayour's lab: In a first-ever human clinical trial, an mRNA vaccine quickly reprogrammed the immune system to attack glioblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor with a dismal prognosis. Among the most impressive findings in the four-patient trial was how quickly the new method—which used a "specific" or personalized vaccine made using a patient's own tumor cells—spurred a vigorous immune-system response to reject the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;In the latest study, Sayour's research team adapted their technology to test a "generalized" mRNA vaccine—meaning it was not aimed at a specific virus or mutated cells of cancer but engineered simply to prompt a strong immune system response. The mRNA formulation was made similarly to the COVID-19 vaccines, rooted in similar technology, but wasn't aimed directly at the well-known spike protein of COVID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mouse models of melanoma, the team saw promising results in normally treatment-resistant tumors when combining the mRNA formulation with a common immunotherapy drug called a PD-1 inhibitor, a type of monoclonal antibody that attempts to "educate" the immune system that a tumor is foreign, said Sayour, a professor in UF's Lillian S. Wells Department of Neurosurgery and the Department of Pediatrics in the UF College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the research a step further, in mouse models of skin, bone and brain cancers, the investigators found beneficial effects when testing a different mRNA formulation as a solo treatment. In some models, the tumors were eliminated entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sayour and colleagues observed that using an mRNA vaccine to activate immune responses seemingly unrelated to cancer could prompt T cells that weren't working before to actually multiply and kill the cancer if the response spurred by the vaccine is strong enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the study's implications are striking, said Mitchell, who directs the UF Clinical and Translational Science Institute and co-directs UF's Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It could potentially be a universal way of waking up a patient's own immune response to cancer," Mitchell said. "And that would be profound if generalizable to human studies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results, he said, show the potential for a universal cancer vaccine that could activate the immune system and prime it to work in tandem with checkpoint-inhibitor drugs to seize upon cancer—or in some cases, even work on its own to kill &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the research team is working to improve current formulations and move to human clinical trials as rapidly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, cuts to Medicaid could result in large numbers of the program’s beneficiaries losing access to medications for opioid use disorder, per the new estimate, which was published by researchers at Boston University and the University of Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We estimate that the bill will cause approximately 156,000 people to lose access to treatment for opioid use disorder and that the overdose rate among that group will double, leading to approximately 1,000 additional fatal overdoses each year,” reads the &lt;a href="https://ldi.upenn.edu/our-work/research-updates/estimated-overdose-deaths-due-to-the-loss-of-moud-in-the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;policy memo&lt;/a&gt;, which was addressed to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Sen. Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The projection relies on estimates from the Congressional Budget Office about likely impacts to Medicaid coverage, as well as other existing data that shows people who use medications like methadone and buprenorphine to treat opioid addiction are vastly less likely to die of a drug overdose. Researchers then used a public health modeling tool specifically tailored to the drug crisis to map out the likely impacts. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There were estimates for how many people were likely to lose Medicaid access, and of those, how many people likely have substance use disorder and are engaged with medicines,” Benjamin Linas, a Boston University physician-researcher who co-authored the memo, told STAT. “We let the model go for a year to see what would happen, and we found that for people who are on a medication, their rates of overdose were about half of what they were for the people who were not.” &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The projection comes amid a period of relative good news for the overdose epidemic: Drug deaths have steadily declined for the last year and a half, appearing to recede to pre-Covid-19 levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Medicaid is easily the nation’s largest funder of addiction treatment, however, and Linas and his coauthors argued that enacting deep cuts to the program risks backtracking on the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/13/overdose-deaths-decline-cdc-reports-under-100-thousand-fatalities/"&gt;recent progress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their findings are consistent with the addiction medicine community’s consensus that people taking methadone or buprenorphine are vastly less likely to experience a fatal overdose. Despite their effectiveness, however, the medications remain highly &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/03/05/opioid-addiction-treatment-methadone-buprenorphine-restrictions/"&gt;stigmatized and underused&lt;/a&gt; — only about one-fifth of Americans with opioid use disorder receive them. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The death toll from overdose remains considerable, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that about 78,000 Americans died in the 12-month period ending in February. The running 12-month death toll in late 2023 exceeded 110,000. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The estimate of the Trump tax law’s impact is “obviously very alarming,” said Regina LaBelle, a former high-ranking Obama administration drug policy official and professor of addiction policy at Georgetown University. But she also called the estimate “the tip of the iceberg,” saying it focuses only on the people whose deaths can most directly be tied to a loss of insurance coverage and ensuing loss of medication access. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Those are the people who we can point to, the knowable population that are going to be more at risk for overdose,” LaBelle said. “What happens with the vast majority of people with a substance use disorder who don’t get any type of treatment and are likely to lose coverage? The 1,000 is a conservative estimate based on who’s getting the medications.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/08/20/flesh-eating-bacteria-deaths-us-florida-new-york/"&gt;rare flesh-eating bacterium&lt;/a&gt; found in warm saltwater has killed at least four people in Florida this year, the state’s health department said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State authorities reported at least 11 &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/flesh-eating-infections-climate-change-global-warming/"&gt;Vibrio vulnificus infections&lt;/a&gt; in recent months across central Florida’s Bay, Broward, Hillsborough and St Johns counties, a region popular with holidaymakers and coastal communities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of bacteria that just live in different areas, even in, like, waterborne spots,” Dr Daniel Egan, an infectious disease specialist at Orlando Health, explained to WESH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So there’s fresh water, salt water, and this bacteria called Vibrio vulnificus likes salt water.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Florida Health Department did not provide details about the deaths&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/3342847/Killer-bug-on-move-with-global-warming.html"&gt;Vibrio vulnificus infections&lt;/a&gt; are rare, with about 150 to 200 cases reported to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But their consequences are often devastating. The bacteria can cause necrotising fasciitis, an aggressive infection in which flesh around an open wound dies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people who contract Vibrio vulnificus require intensive care or even limb amputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infection carries a 20 per cent death rate overall – and as high as 50 per cent if it enters the bloodstream. In many cases, death occurs within two days of symptoms appearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacterium is naturally occurring and thrives in warm, coastal saltwater and brackish environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With temperatures rising globally, experts fear it could spread to areas previously unaffected. It is typically most active between May and October when waters are warmest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, chills, elevated heart rate and disorientation. While healthy people often recover, those with long-standing conditions or compromised immune systems, including cancer patients, are at far greater risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases have surged in recent years, reaching a record high in 2024. The CDC reported 19 deaths and 82 infections, nearly doubling 2023 figures. The spike was linked to an unusually high number of late-season hurricanes in Florida and south-eastern US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;‘Exposure is higher’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases doubled after Hurricanes Milton and Helene, as floodwaters pushed warm saltwater further inland than usual, exposing more people to potential infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are people running around, lifting, moving stuff that normally they wouldn’t do, so the probability of getting that cut or exposure is higher,” said Dr Kami Kim, the director of infectious disease at Tampa General Hospital, speaking to WUSF media at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Climate change is expected to drive those numbers even higher. Warmer oceans fuel stronger storms and longer hurricane seasons, increasing the conditions in which Vibrio vulnificus thrives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Department of Agriculture estimates the cost of infections from salt-reliant bacteria like Vibrio vulnificus will soar to $6.1 billion annually by 2090, up from $2.6 billion in 1995.&lt;/p&gt;

It affects not only individuals but also deeply impacts caregivers and families, often creating emotional, financial, and logistical challenges over time. In its early stages, it might look like simple forgetfulness. But over time, it can take away even the most basic abilities, like recognising loved ones or getting dressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most symptoms begin after age 65, but the condition starts developing in the brain years, sometimes even decades, before that. As life expectancy rises, so does the number of people affected. Over 6 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9502739/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;million &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;older adults in the U.S. live with Alzheimer’s, and that number is expected to grow dramatically. This makes prevention even more important. Growing research shows that our lifestyle choices; what we eat, how we sleep, and how we move, can make a real difference in protecting brain health long before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What causes Alzheimer’s disease? Key risk factors to know&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease doesn’t have a single known cause. Instead, it likely develops from a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that damage the brain over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Age is the biggest risk factor. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/what-causes-alzheimers-disease" data-type="tilCustomLink"&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt;, the risk of Alzheimer’s doubles every five years after age 65. Ageing is linked to the buildup of abnormal proteins like beta-amyloid plaques and tangles in the brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genetics and family history also play a role. People with a parent or sibling with Alzheimer’s are at higher risk. In particular, carrying the APOE ε4 gene variant has been linked to late-onset Alzheimer’s, but it doesn’t guarantee you’ll develop the disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI), especially repeated or severe head injuries, may trigger long-term brain changes that increase Alzheimer’s risk later in life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart and vascular health matters, too. High blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, and heart disease can all impair blood flow to the brain, accelerating damage. Managing these conditions may reduce dementia risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mental health is another factor. Chronic stress and depression have been linked to changes in brain structure and function, especially in memory-related areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smoking and toxin exposure can raise the risk by increasing oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain. Quitting smoking at any age can help lower this risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other contributing factors include low education levels, social isolation, and unhealthy lifestyle habits like poor diet or inactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having these risk factors doesn’t mean you’ll develop Alzheimer’s, but they can increase your chances. Many of them, especially lifestyle-related ones, are preventable or manageable through early action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Recognising the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While occasional forgetfulness is a normal part of ageing, Alzheimer’s disease involves ongoing cognitive and behavioural decline that interferes with daily life. These changes typically worsen over time as brain cells are progressively damaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/10_signs" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-symptoms-and-diagnosis/what-are-signs-alzheimers-disease" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, early signs include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Memory loss that disrupts daily routines, such as forgetting recent conversations or appointments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty completing familiar tasks, like using appliances or managing bills.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Problem-solving challenges, including trouble planning or following steps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Language issues, such as struggling to find the right words or follow conversations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disorientation, with confusion about time or location.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poor judgment, including neglecting hygiene or falling for scams.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mood and personality changes, such as irritability, anxiety, or social withdrawal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These symptoms don’t always indicate Alzheimer’s; they can result from other conditions like depression or medication side effects. A medical diagnosis is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In later stages, people may lose the ability to communicate, walk, or care for themselves. Research shows that early detection and intervention can improve quality of life and slow disease progression. If signs appear, consult a healthcare professional promptly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;11 lifestyle changes that could help prevent Alzheimer’s&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s often begins to develop decades before symptoms appear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/abstract" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;now shows that up to 45% of dementia cases could be delayed or prevented by addressing modifiable lifestyle factors throughout life. Here’s how targeting key areas can help protect your brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Improve blood flow&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy blood flow supplies the brain with oxygen and nutrients. Studies show that reduced cerebral blood flow is linked to Alzheimer’s and mild cognitive impairment. Promising evidence from &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/newsroom/articles/year-2020/exercise-improves-memory-boosts-blood-flow-to-brain.html?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;UT Southwestern&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; demonstrated that older adults with memory issues who engaged in one year of regular aerobic exercise experienced a nearly 47% increase in blood flow to memory-related brain regions and improved cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Stay mentally active as you age&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building what’s known as “cognitive reserve” helps delay dementia symptoms by strengthening neural networks through lifelong learning and activity. Research from Alzheimer’s Research UK shows that engaging in new, mentally challenging activities throughout life lowers the risk of dementia by up to 30%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reduce inflammation&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation is a known factor in neurodegeneration. Diseases like gum inflammation contribute to increased dementia risk. A nutrient-rich, anti-inflammatory lifestyle, focused on whole foods, regular exercise, stress control, and good oral hygiene, helps protect the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Recognize genetic risk but take action&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrying the APOE-ε4 gene increases Alzheimer’s risk, but lifestyle still matters. The &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/abstract" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Lancet Commission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; reports that even those with high genetic risk can significantly reduce dementia risk through healthy habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Avoid head trauma&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head injuries can increase the risk of dementia later in life. Simple preventive steps, like wearing helmets during sports, using seat belts, and avoiding risky behaviors like texting while driving, can help protect brain health long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Minimize exposure to toxins&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic exposure to environmental toxins such as heavy metals, air pollution, alcohol, and certain medications affects cognitive health. Reducing exposure, eating detox-supportive foods, staying hydrated, and using tools like saunas can help reduce toxic burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Prioritize mental health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression, stress, and anxiety are associated with brain changes and increased dementia risk. Approaches such as therapy, mindfulness, journaling, or meditation can support mental wellbeing and protect cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support immunity&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic illnesses that impair immunity (e.g., infections, autoimmune diseases) can accelerate brain aging. Ensuring good vitamin D levels, a balanced diet, and routine healthcare helps strengthen immune defenses that support brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Balance hormones&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="91"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormones like thyroid, estrogen, and testosterone affect memory and mood. Age-related hormone declines can influence cognition. Regular hormone screenings allow early detection and intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="93"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Avoid “diabesity”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="95"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining obesity and type 2 diabetes, “diabesity” is strongly linked to dementia. Losing weight, managing blood sugar, and lowering systemic inflammation are key to reducing cognitive decline risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="97"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="98"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ensure quality sleep&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="99"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep clears beta-amyloid and supports cognitive processing at night. Even one night of sleep deprivation can raise amyloid levels by 5%, while chronic poor sleep disrupts the toxin-cleaning “glymphatic” system and elevates Alzheimer’s risk. For optimal brain health, aim for 7–8 hours of restorative sleep nightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="101"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/curry-leaves-10-powerful-health-benefits-medicinal-uses-and-how-to-consume-them/articleshow/122575062.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Curry Leaves: 10 powerful health benefits, medicinal uses and how to consume them&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="104"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="105"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 04:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAJBVV95cUxQOFlUYjNLeTRzM0lmMHdtWTByRk5keWlaT19HZ195RTdGNGFuNUV0WFE0bEI5aTNYOVdFdmpsUmgteG1ISWFkVUdJaUIwek16Q2E1NWF0UlREek1QdWtaM1UwUWkxZ3F2ZG5GMGc1Y0tWZHo3eldrdnVmYXpkdVFrUjA2bU5sdFE1cXJuZkUzSUktZnBtdDBBYjZET08xMXNnZGxaWGJmM3FCbFQ4cXFONmVUTTRRR2V1X01vS3hYYjdUT0lBQ09IUUxfSllIVkpzc2U1OXVXMmh0WXZFRnVDVENnYk0wWFRrYmtJUDE4NGFWYVg5cGZKY1QzLVpteEhON002ZlVBb0kxUndjNGZlZWkxYjVIQzJ4dkx4cA</guid></item><item><title>科罗拉多男子为在严重的西尼罗河病毒病例中生存而战- KUSA.com | Colorado man fights to survive severe case of West Nile Virus - KUSA.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPTXlIaXVVcHNHUF9Fc1U3enVaUTF2NG1CT0ZXOVQ1dVZ6Ym9Ub3FDQmRXSXdhNnR2V0JVTl8xVG5DcW1DYkJLN3BsdWxhbjZsSnNGNUx0R29veFhLa0hqM3dRVjJ2TEZtOWpkWjJCNWZldnhtWUZTdjMxZTFSd0QwbTZ4RFhEWjY2VTd3LUE5T1JjUlhqYnU4T1JRUUZMemZVTG9iNC1vR01MTzJtbDV6RDFjTlN4eDZhd2Fr?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are at least four distinct subtypes of autism, a new study finds, helping to explain the various trajectories of individuals on the spectrum and offering a path toward more targeted treatments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers grouped over 5,000 children ages 4 to 18 with autism based on more than 230 traits like social interactions, repetitive behaviors and developmental milestones to arrive at the classifications. Then, they assessed the children’s genetic profiles to uncover patterns characteristic of the different groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These findings are powerful because the classes represent different clinical presentations and outcomes, and critically we were able to connect them to distinct underlying biology,” said Aviya Litman of Princeton University, a co-lead author of the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02224-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published this month in the journal Nature Genetics.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  



&lt;p&gt;More than a third of children with autism in the study were in what the researchers dubbed the “Social and Behavioral Challenges” group. These children display core autism traits like social difficulty and repetitive behaviors and often have co-occurring conditions like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but tend to reach developmental milestones on schedule.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The “Moderate Challenges” group, which included about 34% of kids studied, experience a similar trajectory, but with milder presentations and no co-occurring psychiatric conditions. A third group known as “Mixed ASD with Developmental Delay” accounted for the roughly 19% of kids studied who exhibited delayed walking, talking and other developmental milestones, but without signs of anxiety, depression or disruptive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A final group described as “Broadly Affected” had more extreme and wide-ranging challenges including developmental delays, social and communication difficulties, repetitive behaviors and co-occurring psychiatric conditions. About 10% of kids with autism fell into this category.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study found clear genetic patterns to explain the different presentations. The Broadly Affected group had the highest proportion of problematic de novo mutations, those that are not passed down from either parent, the findings show. By contrast, individuals in the Mixed ASD with Developmental Delay group were more likely to have rare inherited genetic variants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notably, in the Social and Behavioral Challenges group, researchers found mutations in genes that typically activate later in childhood, which could explain why children in this group are often diagnosed at older ages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This study shows us that autism isn’t a single condition with a single cause,” said Dr. Andy Shih, chief science officer at Autism Speaks. “It’s a spectrum made up of many different experiences, challenges and underlying biology. By understanding those differences, we can work toward better care that is matched to each person’s unique needs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the study identified four autism subtypes, the researchers said there could be more and that unlocking this information may have significant implications for families.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Understanding genetic causes for more individuals with autism could lead to more targeted developmental monitoring, precision treatment and tailored support and accommodations at school or work,” said Jennifer Foss-Feig, a coauthor of the study and a clinical psychologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who also serves as vice president and senior scientific officer at the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative. “It could tell families, when their children with autism are still young, something more about what symptoms they might — or might not — experience, what to look out for over the course of a lifespan, which treatments to pursue and how to plan for their future.”&lt;/p&gt;

Here at Well + Being, we’re excited about a “new” walking technique that’s actually been around for decades. And it’s worth rediscovering. As you know, exercise is so important for health and longevity, but it’s not always convenient or easy to schedule. That’s why we love to hear about workouts that maximize the benefits — better mood, sleep, muscle strength and blood pressure, anyone?— and doesn’t take &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; long. This one, called “Japanese walking” can be done in just 30 minutes a day. And as an added bonus, summer can be the perfect time to take a walk in nature (which has its own mental health benefits) while also hitting your exercise goals. We’ve even scheduled a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/22/japanese-walking-questions-answers/" target="_blank"&gt;Live Chat on Tuesday at noon Eastern&lt;/a&gt; to answer your questions about how to use walking to get in shape.

One particular technique, known as interval walking training (IWT) or “Japanese walking,” is getting renewed attention after going viral on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ORKFK5FQYRH4FNN7F6XGKASSSQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In a 2007 study, volunteers did three minutes of fast walking followed by three minutes at a slower pace, for 30 minutes per day at least four days per week. “One of the most surprising findings was that IWT markedly increased physical fitness and decreased blood pressure after the 5-month intervention whereas these improvements were not observed in the moderate-intensity continuous walking group,” Shizue Masuki, a researcher on the team and professor at Shinshu University Graduate School of Medicine in Matsumoto, told our reporter, Alexandra Frost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="QD6CIJTJLNBUXMPBUEGLPULFHY" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="QD6CIJTJLNBUXMPBUEGLPULFHY" data-testid="article-header"&gt;You might be fooling yourself about peanut butter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TOA62XB73VFNRLIZ3SWLXK35GE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Optimizing your protein intake can be tricky. It’s not just &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/05/24/protein-weight-loss-muscle-facts/" target="_blank"&gt;how much protein&lt;/a&gt; you eat that matters, but when you eat it, and the foods that you get it from. You may even have higher protein needs than you think depending on your overall health, your age, your activity levels and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RXY3DJDFUZG33NU46LVFUVT2MQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Nutrition reporter Anahad O’Connor spoke to experts and analyzed studies to identify the most common protein pitfalls. For example, you have probably heard that peanut butter has a lot of protein. But in reality, it’s a better source of fat than protein, said Jose Antonio, a professor of health and human performance at Nova Southeastern University in Florida. “The fat is good for you. But don’t fool yourself into thinking that you’re getting a lot of high-quality protein.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YELXDYSLY5GE7IOUBO54HS23KM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To find out more about the mistakes that people make when it comes to eating protein, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/16/protein-how-much-do-i-need/" target="_blank"&gt;read our story here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="GQU2LZM3U5BLHBP4ISI3JZU52I" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="GQU2LZM3U5BLHBP4ISI3JZU52I" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What I eat in a day to boost my gut health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7GISK2JFOJDPXFRCUDOHSFGQ5E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our Ask a Doctor columnist is Trisha S.

This global surge is the result of several factors, from &lt;a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/european-region-reports-highest-number-measles-cases-more-25-years-unicef-whoeurope"&gt;vaccine hesitancy to missed immunisation campaigns&lt;/a&gt;, leaving many children unprotected and vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there's more at stake than just measles itself. Emerging research suggests that the measles vaccination may offer surprising additional health benefits. Children who receive the vaccine have been shown to have a significantly &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12690020/"&gt;lower risk of infections&lt;/a&gt; from diseases unrelated to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/measles-devastates-your-body-in-a-variety-of-ways-heres-whats-at-risk?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Measles Devastates Your Body in a Variety of Ways. Here's What's at Risk.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One explanation for this broader benefit is the idea of "measles amnesia." This refers to the ability of the measles virus to erase parts of the body's immune memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our immune system contains various cells that protect us from infections. Some produce  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="168358" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt; that neutralise  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="168358" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt;, while others detect and destroy infected cells. Immune memory allows the body to "remember" past infections and mount faster responses in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32891958/"&gt;measles infection may reduce&lt;/a&gt; the number and diversity of these memory cells – leaving children vulnerable to a wide range of diseases they had previously developed immunity to. In other words, the virus doesn't just make children ill in the short term, it may also undo years of immune protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168367" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168367" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/measles_amnesia_vaccine_642.jpg" alt="white blood cells under a microscope" class="wp-image-168367 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/measles_amnesia_vaccine_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/measles_amnesia_vaccine_642-444x415.jpg 444w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/measles_amnesia_vaccine_642-600x561.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168367" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Immune cells under a microscope. (jarun011/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one study, researchers found that between &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31672891/"&gt;11% and 73% of antibodies&lt;/a&gt; targeting other diseases were lost after a measles infection in unvaccinated children. This immune depletion was not observed in children who had received the vaccine, suggesting that vaccination protects against this damaging effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This broad loss of immune protection may explain why measles outbreaks are often followed by spikes in other infectious diseases. Ongoing studies are exploring the impact of measles amnesia in regions such as &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0314828"&gt;West Africa&lt;/a&gt;, where measles and other infections remain widespread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A vaccine that does more?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another theory for the vaccine's broader benefit is known as the "non-specific effect". Unlike measles amnesia, which explains how the virus weakens immunity, the non-specific effect suggests that the measles vaccine actively strengthens the immune system against a wide range of pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research has shown that measles vaccination may &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38290093/"&gt;enhance the function&lt;/a&gt; of certain immune cells, making them more effective at fighting off other diseases. Some scientists believe this effect, rather than protection against amnesia alone, could be the primary reason why vaccinated children have better overall health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine is a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27737834/"&gt;live attenuated vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, which means it uses a weakened version of the virus to stimulate a strong immune response. Live vaccines, including the BCG vaccine for tuberculosis, are known to provide &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27737834/"&gt;broad immune training effects&lt;/a&gt;, which may explain this non-specific protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Forgotten the dangers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1960s, before widespread vaccination, measles caused around &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles"&gt;2.6 million deaths per year&lt;/a&gt;. It's hard to imagine today, but that's partly the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As measles became rare, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles"&gt;society began to forget&lt;/a&gt; how serious it is. We forgot how contagious it is (one infected person can spread the virus to up to 90% of nearby unvaccinated people) and we forgot how effective vaccination is (&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/policies/position-papers/measles"&gt;two doses&lt;/a&gt; provide more than 90% long-term protection).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168371" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168371" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/measles_amnesia_rash_642.jpg" alt="measles rash" class="wp-image-168371 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/measles_amnesia_rash_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/measles_amnesia_rash_642-444x415.jpg 444w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/measles_amnesia_rash_642-600x561.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168371" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Measles is more than an itchy rash. (Bilanol/Getty Images/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in some circles, this fading memory has been replaced by something more dangerous: mistrust. Misinformation, vaccine myths, and anti-vaccine rhetoric are spreading, just like the virus itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, whether the additional protection offered by the vaccine is due to prevention of immune amnesia, a non-specific immune boost, or both, the takeaway is the same: Vaccinate children against measles. Because when we protect them from measles, we may also be protecting them from so much more.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261136/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you think of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/anti-inflammatory-foods-to-stock-up-on-this-spring-11696622" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory foods&lt;/a&gt;, fatty fish like salmon, sardines and mackerel might not be the first to come to mind—but registered dietitians agree that they should be. Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, fatty fish may help reduce chronic inflammation and lower the risk of chronic diseases, like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease and cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Including more fatty fish in your diet may support overall health and reduce your risk of these inflammation-related conditions,” says &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/author/lauren-manaker/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Lauren Manaker, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fatty fish like salmon, tuna, mackerel, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8059288/are-canned-sardines-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sardines&lt;/a&gt; and anchovies are an excellent source of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; More specifically, they’re rich in the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which have anti-inflammatory effects.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “These essential fatty acids play a critical role in reducing inflammation in the body,” Manaker says. “They work by decreasing the production of inflammatory molecules and compounds, which can help manage &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; linked to conditions like heart disease.”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One study found that consuming two to three portions of fish per week reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular disease outcomes by 8% and 10%, respectively. It also found that daily fish intake reduced the risk of heart disease by up to 30%.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can think of these anti-inflammatory properties as a protective barrier that helps defend the body against cellular damage. “Consuming more fatty fish [may also] help ensure our organs are protected from external and internal threats, such as pollutants,” says &lt;a href="https://tracynutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Tracy Lockwood Beckerman, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. These essential fatty acids are also important for supporting heart, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026789/best-nutrient-for-brain-health-as-you-age/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; and skin health, adds &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/eastcoasthealth" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Maddie Pasquariello, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because the body can’t produce them on its own, it’s essential to consume &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-as-many-omega-3s-as-salmon-11681920" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3s through food&lt;/a&gt;. There’s no official recommendation for how much EPA and DHA to consume daily. However, the American Heart Association recommends eating 3 ounces of fish—preferably oily fish—at least twice a week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beyond their anti-inflammatory benefits, fatty fish are also a great source of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/4-anti-inflammatory-proteins-you-should-be-eating-11679932" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, which helps with muscle repair, growth and immune functioning. They also contain a variety of micronutrients that are essential for overall health. “Fatty fish are a source of vitamins and minerals such as vitamin D, a nutrient crucial for bone health and immune support, and selenium, an antioxidant that protects cells from damage,” says Manaker.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Sardines or Anchovies to Salads, Snacks and Appetizers: &lt;/strong&gt;“I love using anchovies in Caesar dressing or on top of salads, and sardines are delicious on toast as an appetizer or snack,” Pasquariello says. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start with a Milder Fish:&lt;/strong&gt; “Salmon and tuna are some of the easiest fish to cook, requiring just a quick sear or bake in the oven,” Pasquariello says. “I love pairing salmon with a Dijon mustard glaze or simple lemon and olive oil dressing, or cooking tuna with a quick sear on each side and topping it with sesame seeds and soy sauce.” &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/underrated-fish-you-should-be-eating-more-of-11727002" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Trout&lt;/a&gt; is another mild fish that’s quick to prepare. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enjoy in Smaller Amounts: &lt;/strong&gt;If you don’t &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; the taste of fish but still want to give it a try, consider a dish where fish plays more of a supporting role rather than the central focus. “You can add fish to dishes like pasta along with other ingredients to dilute the taste while still reaping the benefits,” Manaker says. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat More Canned Fish:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8058717/reasons-to-eat-canned-fish-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Canned fish&lt;/a&gt;, like salmon or sardines, offer a convenient and cost-effective way to add more fish to your diet. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stock Your Freezer with Frozen Fish: &lt;/strong&gt;Keep frozen fish on hand for nights when you’re too busy to make it to the grocery store. “Frozen options provide the same beneficial antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties as fresh fish and might even have a less-pronounced fishy smell during cooking,” Beckerman says. Plus, you can &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cooking-salmon-from-frozen-8759544" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;cook salmon directly from frozen&lt;/a&gt;—no thawing required. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fatty fish are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and are an excellent addition to an &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-an-anti-inflammatory-diet-8764103" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory diet&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re not eating fatty fish like tuna, mackerel, sardines and salmon regularly, now is a great time to start. And remember, eating fish doesn’t have to be complicated or expensive. Try adding fresh or canned fish to scrambled eggs, salads, toast, stir-fries or pasta dishes. 
&lt;/p&gt;

He’s been sober for 14 and a half years and now helps others navigate the same fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;WATCH: Gallatin County Grapples with Reputation as 'Drunkest County in America'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="VideoEnhancement" data-video-disable-history&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a far worse problem than I think people realize,” Holton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As first reported in January, the CDC found that 26.8 percent of Gallatin County residents drink excessively, giving it the highest rate of heavy drinking in the nation. Holton says that numbers don’t just reflect lifestyle; they reflect culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="Figure" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How many breweries do we have? How many coffee shops do we have? We are a culture, a community that is thriving off of chemical dependency,” Holton says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holton says that while Gallatin Valley offers mountain views, outdoor recreation, and a high quality of life, he says that comes at a steep price for many. Also known as a paradise paradox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The minute we create a culture that uses chemical dependency as a coping mechanism, you’ve already created the disease,” Holton said. “Now, when we have people that are affected by it, you have to help them and treat them, and we have to change the culture. The area we live in is beautiful, but we are a sick community. We really are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the numbers back him up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services,alcohol-related deaths have nearly doubled over the past decade, rising from 1,563 deaths between 2009 and 2013 to 2,941 between 2019 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023 alone, hospitals across the state billed over $220 million for alcohol-related hospitalizations and emergency department visits. And in 2024, 66.7 percent of Montanans in treatment for substance use disorders reported alcohol as their primary substance of misuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bozeman Police Chief Jim Veltkamp says the numbers are felt daily by first responders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can tell you when patrol officers are out on patrol, most calls they go to involve alcohol in some way, shape, or form,” Veltkamp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that one troubling sign of alcohol misuse is the high level of tolerance officers often encounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We routinely see people at a very high alcohol concentration who seem to be functioning pretty decently — and that is an indication that it’s very common for them to be consuming very large amounts of alcoholic beverages,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Holton says that reflects a broader change in the substances people are using — and how strong those substances have become.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The substances we are using are getting higher in concentration,” Holton said. “You are going to end up with a quicker dependency, you’re going to have more health problems, and more criminal justice interactions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says 90 percent of the clients at Cedar Creek have had some involvement with the criminal justice system, and while the clinic runs intensive outpatient &lt;br&gt;programs, resources are stretched thin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the closure of facilities like the Hope House in Bozeman and federal funding freezes looming, Holton says his staff is already seeing the impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are starting to see the influx of clients coming in and the people that need help,” he said. “We are in need of more funding because it doesn't exist.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges, Holton says he and his team remain committed to the work because, without them, many people would have nowhere to turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They are long days. But it is what we have to do in this community to be able to make it viable. If not, our doors would be closed. And then what do we have?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resources: &lt;a class="Link" href="https://dphhs.mt.gov/BHDD/SubstanceAbuse/index"&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://dphhs.mt.gov/BHDD/SubstanceAbuse/index&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.cedarcreekintegratedhealth.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://www.cedarcreekintegratedhealth.org/&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
