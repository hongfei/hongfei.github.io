That moment, back in 2015, marked the beginning of her battle with an extremely rare neurological condition known as visual snow syndrome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also has to contend with double vision, extreme sensitivity to light, ringing in her ears, and constant headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her symptoms became so debilitating that she could no longer drive and had to take an extended leave of absence from college. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because visual snow syndrome is so rare and difficult to diagnose, it took years before Domb finally understood what was happening to her body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, she's leading the charge to raise awareness for the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For years, I struggled to find answers, only to be misdiagnosed and constantly dismissed by medical professionals who claimed my symptoms "didn't exist" or told me I was "too young" to have serious health problems,' Domb told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Soon, even familiar faces and beautiful landscapes transformed into disorienting, nightmarish experiences.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Cleveland Clinic notes that visual snow syndrome is a relatively new diagnosis — the term was only coined in 2013 — and researchers still don't fully understand what causes it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some scientists believe it may be the result of overactivity in the parts of the brain responsible for processing images. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some cases, experts have found the syndrome in people who also suffer from anxiety or migraines — conditions often preceded by 'auras,' or sensory disturbances that can include ringing in the ears, flashing lights, or even speech and language problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Auras associated with anxiety are often linked to heightened sensitivity and hyperstimulation, which can trigger visual or sensory distortions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Domb was desperately hunting for a diagnosis, she was prescribed medications that actually made her symptoms worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The doctors who took me seriously warned that I was likely going blind, but they couldn't confirm when or if it would happen, as my medical tests on my eyes consistently came back "normal",' she recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is because visual snow syndrome is a neurological condition so standard eye tests will not work.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no cure for visual snow syndrome but, along with medication, treatment options include therapy to help reduce stress and specialized lenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The popular notion that my twenties would be the best years of my life quickly turned into a nightmarish medical odyssey I wouldn't wish on anyone,' Domb said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Because visual snow syndrome is so rare and difficult to diagnose, it took years before Domb finally understood what was happening to her body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After realizing she was suffering from visual snow syndrome, Domb founded the Visual Snow Initiative to raise awareness and support others who were 'suffering in silence.' She now travels the world talking about the condition and helping others &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was devastating to feel invisible and alone in my struggle.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite everything, Domb threw herself into research and eventually discovered that others were suffering from the same mysterious symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said realizing she wasn't alone was 'both comforting and heartbreaking.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Many shared their pain and frustration, and some, feeling desperate and without the resources or support they needed, even suggested suicide as a way out,' she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After realizing she was suffering from visual snow syndrome, Domb founded the Visual Snow Initiative to raise awareness and support others who were 'suffering in silence.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since she launched the organization in 2018 — three years after her symptoms first appeared — it has heard from patients in 93 countries and amassed more than 60,000 followers across social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Touching on some of the groundbreaking discoveries she's helped support, Domb says, 'Some individuals are born with symptoms, while others, like me, experience onset of the condition at any point in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Clinical cases show that people as young as 8 years old have developed visual snow syndrome, though onset most commonly occurs during the teenage or young adult years.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thanks to her efforts, the condition has now been recognized by the World Health Organization and included in its annual International Classification of Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to raising awareness, Domb's organization is helping to fund research into treatment and management options for the little-known condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The health advocate and entrepreneur concludes, 'I wasn't and am not a doctor – just a patient who had been disregarded, but I refused to let that silence me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My mission was never about proving others wrong, but about giving a voice to those who were overlooked, so no one would have to endure the medical odyssey that I did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Recognition from the WHO is historic and lives forever. I am deeply grateful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But this is just the beginning. With continued support, I hope Visual Snow Initiative can continue pushing for further advancements in research, treatments, and patient care.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Depending on who you follow on social media, you may have come across talk of a little-known herb called ashwagandha over the past year. Celebrities including Meghan Markle, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Aniston are &lt;a href="https://uk.style.yahoo.com/anxiety-aid-meghan-markle-jennifer-063000616.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; to use ashwagandha for its calming effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://apa.uk.com/herb-of-the-month/ashwagandha"&gt;Ashwagandha&lt;/a&gt; has been trending on social media with &lt;a href="https://opalbond.co.uk/blog/ashwagandha-trends-and-consumer-benefits#:%7E:text=Social%20Media%20Influence,new%20health%20and%20wellness%20trends"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; showing #ashwagandha had more than 670 million views on TikTok in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientifically known as &lt;em&gt;Withania somnifera&lt;/em&gt;, ashwagandha is a common herb used for thousands of years in Ayurvedic medicine – an ancient Indian system of healing based on the belief that health and wellness depend on a balance between the body, mind and spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayurveda emphasises a holistic approach to health using natural treatments, such as herbal remedies, dietary changes, physical therapy, meditation and yoga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But beyond the social media buzz, what does science say about this herb's benefits?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashwagandha root has been used in traditional medicine as an &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33103257/"&gt;adaptogen&lt;/a&gt;. This means it could help people become more resilient to various types of stress, whether biological, physical, or chemical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strongest &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210803321000142"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; available for ashwagandha is as a stress and anxiety reliever. A &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210803321000142"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; looking at several small studies showed that ashwagandha can significantly reduce levels of perceived stress and anxiety in people. This may be partly due to its regulating effect on stress hormones such as cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Govl2FUGTUw?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ashwagandha is also known for its ability to improve sleep quality. The "somnifera" part of its scientific name, meaning "sleep-inducing" hints at its effects. Some &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Ashwagandha-HealthProfessional/#en2"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt; show it can help people fall asleep faster and enjoy deeper, more restful sleep, thus boosting energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be beneficial for people suffering from insomnia. But there is no evidence showing whether it is better than taking sleeping tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Possible benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, this herb has been associated with other benefits. The Sanskrit word "ashwagandha" means "the smell of a horse," symbolising its ability to give the strength and stamina of a horse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Athletes and fitness enthusiasts may benefit from ashwagandha's ability to enhance physical performance. Some &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210803321000142"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; indicates that ashwagandha can improve strength, muscle mass and oxygen use during exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For men, ashwagandha has been shown in some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30466985/"&gt;small studies&lt;/a&gt; to boost testosterone levels and improve fertility by increasing sperm count and motility. This may be linked to dehydroepiandrosterone (&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526128/"&gt;DHEA&lt;/a&gt;) – a sex hormone that your body naturally produces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DHEA is used to make other hormones such as testosterone. This means men with prostate  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="159248" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; sensitive to testosterone should avoid using this herb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_159253" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159253" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/ashwagandha-2-642x428.jpg" alt="Ashwagandha: This Ancient Herb Is Trending For Its Potential Health Benefits – But Also Comes With Risks" class="wp-image-159253 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/ashwagandha-2-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/ashwagandha-2-622x415.jpg 622w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/ashwagandha-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/ashwagandha-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/ashwagandha-2.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-159253" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(eskymaks/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ashwagandha has been linked to improved cognitive function, such as better memory and focus. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31742775/"&gt;Small studies&lt;/a&gt;, involving older people who have some cognitive impairment, suggest that ashwagandha may help to reduce &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5551541/"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; – harmful molecules called free radicals that can damage cells in the body – and inflammation, which can negatively effect memory and thinking processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also ongoing &lt;a href="https://www.isrctn.com/editorial/retrieveFile/1d0c866d-98bd-4fd2-937d-a21ca36c4d7a/42176"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; investigating whether ashwagandha may be effective in treating long COVID symptoms such as fatigue and cognitive dysfunction – having trouble with mental tasks such as thinking, remembering and making decisions – but there's no robust evidence yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashwagandha is rich in phytochemicals, including withanolides. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/withanolide"&gt;Withanolides are steroidal lactones&lt;/a&gt; – they are structurally similar to steroids, with a lactone ring in their chemical structure – that are thought to help cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can lower blood sugar in both healthy people and those with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="159248" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, although larger &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31975514/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; need to be done. In &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7696210/"&gt;animal studies&lt;/a&gt;, withanolides show anti-inflammatory activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Side effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While ashwagandha may offer potential health benefits, it also has numerous &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Ashwagandha-HealthProfessional/"&gt;risks and side effects&lt;/a&gt;. The long-term safety of ashwagandha is not well-documented. Most studies have focused on short-term use, typically up to three months – but the benefits may take some weeks or months to appear. The most common side effects are mild stomach upsets and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rGVGMQno3QM?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its use is not advised in people with some pre-existing health conditions such as liver disease. Although rare, there have been &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Ashwagandha-HealthProfessional/#en8"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; of liver problems, including severe liver failure, associated with ashwagandha use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashwagandha may &lt;a href="https://www.rheumatologyadvisor.com/features/herbal-supplement-use-in-autoimmune-disease/"&gt;stimulate&lt;/a&gt; the immune system, potentially causing flare ups for people with autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also possible that ashwagandha may interact with some medications, such as immunosuppressants, sedatives and thyroid hormone medications. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25624699/"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that ashwagandha may influence thyroid function, particularly by increasing thyroid hormone levels. It may also interact with thyroid medications, such as levothyroxine, possibly leading to overmedication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pregnant and breastfeeding women are advised to avoid ashwagandha, especially at higher doses. The herb may be linked to miscarriages and, although there's conflicting &lt;a href="https://herbal-ahp.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Press-Release-Ashwagandha-Abortifacient-Assessment_06-24-2024.pdf"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt;, it's best to be cautious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashwagandha holds promise, then, as a stress reliever, sleep aid and even an energy booster. With growing interest and a large body of anecdotal evidence, it's no surprise that it's become a favourite among wellness enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, scientific research is still developing and more extensive  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="159248" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; are needed to confirm the benefits, side effects and determine the safest, most effective doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're considering incorporating ashwagandha into your routine, especially for long-term use, do consult a healthcare professional first, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions or are taking other medications.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/253979/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As Marmon hinted, crepey skin primarily results from sun exposure. “A frequent misunderstanding is that crepey skin develops solely from aging, but lifestyle factors like sun exposure and smoking are significant contributors,” she said. “While everyone is susceptible to crepey skin, people with lighter skin tones, who are more prone to sun damage, are particularly at risk.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun exposure causes the &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/best-products-for-sagging-skin_l_614b5430e4b0175a1839f2cc" target="_blank"&gt;skin to lose volume&lt;/a&gt; due to dehydration. “It doesn’t store water the same because the integrity of the skin is damaged,” board-certified dermatologist Dr. Shani Francis told HuffPost. That leads to degradation of &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/collagen" target="_blank"&gt;collagen&lt;/a&gt; and elastin, the proteins that hold water and therefore help the skin keep its structure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any ultraviolet exposure, even from tanning beds, can lead to the formation of crepey skin. “It’s really not the sun itself — it’s ultraviolet radiation,” Francis explained. “Any type of ultraviolet radiation exposure is going to damage and degrade the collagen and the elastin tissues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetics play a factor, too. “If you look at your parents, if they have crepey skin, you know you need to start the process of preventing a little bit earlier,” Francis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Marmon, many women begin to notice crepey skin around the time they hit &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/menopause" target="_blank"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt; because the drop in estrogen during that time speeds up the decrease in collagen and elastin, resulting in a thinning of the skin with a loss of moisture and fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It starts around middle age and gets worse as we age,” Francis reiterated. “The elastic fibers, they start off very strong. Twenty-something-, 30-something-year-olds, their skin snaps right back. Once you get to 40, it doesn’t quite work that way.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Board-certified dermatologist &lt;a href="https://www.sherberandrad.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Noëlle S. Sherber&lt;/a&gt; told HuffPost that crepey skin from UV damage usually shows up around the eyes, the chest and the backs of the hands. Some people also see it above the knees and on the inner arms.&lt;/p&gt;

Not so much.

Additionally, since crepey skin is thinner and less elastic, it may be more susceptible to bruising and tearing, which could lead to infection if not properly cared for.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plenty of creams and lotions claim to alleviate the appearance of crepey skin, and anyone who wants to take care of it quickly can seek doctor-administered treatments.

Sunscreen doesn’t last. It’s not permanent. Sun protection instead of sunscreen is much more comprehensive. I always tell people, think of sunscreen as your last line of defense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For the areas that clothing and accessories can’t cover, apply sunscreen. &lt;a href="https://www.aad.org/public/everyday-care/sun-protection/shade-clothing-sunscreen/is-sunscreen-safe" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The American Academy of Dermatology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The American Academy of Dermatology&lt;/a&gt; recommends a water-resistant one that offers broad-spectrum protection with SPF 30 or higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some over-the-counter options to try for crepey skin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Anna Frank / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Marmon wants to temper expectations of seeing results from over-the-counter treatments claiming to eliminate the appearance of crepey skin. “While creams, moisturizers, lotions and especially sunscreen are helpful in maintaining skin health, eliminating all &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/anti-aging-skin-care-body_l_62aa46fee4b0cf43c8520b45" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:signs of aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;signs of aging&lt;/a&gt; is pretty much impossible,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, with regular use, topical products with ingredients such as retinoids, alpha hydroxy acids, peptides, growth factors, hyaluronic acid and antioxidants can help to stimulate collagen production, therefore improving skin quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“These products generally take several months before you see their potential benefit,” Sherber warned, adding that a high price tag doesn’t equate to a higher likelihood for results. “A misconception is that only high-end skin care products can combat crepey skin, when in fact, consistent use is far more important than the price tag.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You want to make sure the moisturizer you pick also contains water to rehydrate the skin. “Water is the number one hydrator,” Francis said. “A big mistake people make is coating skin with oil when they’re already dehydrated because all that’s going to do is improve the barrier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Francis particularly loves &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-is-niacinimide_l_60d9d297e4b0b9db24990abe" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:products with niacinamide;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;products with niacinamide&lt;/a&gt;, a form of vitamin B3, as a way to help alleviate the appearance of crepey skin. It can also be taken as a supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sherber offered an easy way to test whether a moisturizer is thick enough to properly hydrate: “When you open the jar and flip it upside down, if it doesn’t drip, then it should be a good barrier support product.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doctor-administered treatments to address crepey skin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Klaus Vedfelt / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On May 15, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first skin booster, Skinvive by Juvederm, to improve skin smoothness in adults over 21. The booster is an injectable hyaluronic acid with a serum texture that has been used for years overseas, where they refer to it as Volite. “Unlike fillers, which volumize, skin boosters replenish skin’s deep hydration and can give fantastic results for skin quality improvement, especially in thin-skinned areas that are prone to crepey texture,” Sherber explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Other injectables, like Radiesse and Sculptra, stimulate the body to synthesize collagen. Options such as radio frequency skin tightening and fractional non-ablative lasers stimulate the body’s natural healing process, leading to the production of new collagen and elastin that promotes thicker and more elastic skin. “Both can significantly improve skin quality,” Sherber said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For certain anatomical areas, such as around the eyes, she suggested neuromodulators like Botox for reducing crinkling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, “while we can somewhat improve the appearance of crepey skin, the aging process is ongoing and inevitable,” Marmon said. “It is important to have realistic expectations in terms of what to expect from anti-aging products regardless of what they claim to do. Aging is a natural part of life and much better than the alternative.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This article originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/crepey-skin_l_648227d3e4b025003edc406e" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HuffPost.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 01:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxPWC1wdmMwU0FtY21fb2tKZllROUVHeWlnQXNuZWF0ZDN4bTBDaHFudG9lMllEQ3g5aXZRTXJSNHpjT1pMbjlpX1hZY2N5akFhM2Rvano1a0p4QWdTUmhxUDZHbUxnN3FWWkFMaVEwYi1UV2lyOC1OTzNLakxMdERPRjZKa2xkQQ</guid></item><item><title>小RFK的愿望成真：每个人都得了麻疹-《每日野兽》 | RFK Jr.’s Wish Is Coming True: Everybody’s Getting Measles - The Daily Beast</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxOeTlRUjloZVpoVTZWZnF0ZC1YUkJwaHRhUkUzNU9MeXBnMUpuZlJRUzJ0M2MzZ1pZcm9xZjdVVEVVbHlHdTR5Z293UnhYNDhTQ3djTXU1NFRqTU0yck02a184eVhhWF9TdGFXRE5lRThncC1OamJGcDlvMFdLbzdGWUNNV1NuNGtBUFcxR1BR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/robert-f-kennedy-jr/"&gt;RFK Jr.&lt;/a&gt;’s vision for America is rapidly becoming reality, with the number of measles cases skyrocketing across the country, bringing the number of confirmed cases to a total of 884.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; published by the CDC on Friday, there have been 884 cases of measles reported across 29 states, including Alaska, California, Hawaii, Illinois, New York and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Just last month, the Health and Human Services Secretary appeared to argue in an interview with Sean Hannity that natural immunity was the best defense against the highly infectious disease. In other words, Kennedy believes that it would be great if everyone got measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“It used to be, when I [was] a kid, that everybody got measles,” he told the Fox News host. “And the measles gave you lifetime protection against measles infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He continued, “The vaccine doesn’t do that. The vaccine is effective for some people for life, but for many people it wanes.” He went on to argue against the MMR vaccine, telling Hannity that the government shouldn’t force people to get the vaccine, because “There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year. It causes all the illnesses that measles itself cause, like encephalitis and blindness, etc., so people ought to be able to make that choice for themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In 2025 alone, measles cases have been reported in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;At least six of those states—Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio and Texas—have reported outbreaks, meaning three or more related cases. Texas, the epicenter of the outbreak, has seen 646 cases since late January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;There have been three confirmed deaths, two of whom were children: 8-year-old Daisy Hildebrand and 6-year-old Kayley Fehr. Those mark the first deaths from measles in the U.S. in more than a decade. The majority of cases have occurred in individuals under the age of 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Stanford University researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/24/measles-cases-deaths-vaccine-rates-rfk-jr/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/24/measles-cases-deaths-vaccine-rates-rfk-jr/"&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; that if vaccination rates remain steady, measles could become entrenched, resulting in hundreds of thousands of cases “where deaths are commonplace and hospitalizations are happening all the time,” according to Nathan Lo, a Stanford University physician and author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Only two percent of the 884 people infected in 2025 have received the recommended dose of the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Daily Beast</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 00:11:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxOeTlRUjloZVpoVTZWZnF0ZC1YUkJwaHRhUkUzNU9MeXBnMUpuZlJRUzJ0M2MzZ1pZcm9xZjdVVEVVbHlHdTR5Z293UnhYNDhTQ3djTXU1NFRqTU0yck02a184eVhhWF9TdGFXRE5lRThncC1OamJGcDlvMFdLbzdGWUNNV1NuNGtBUFcxR1BR</guid></item><item><title>美国最有可能患上最致命癌症的国家……您的排名在哪里？ --《每日邮报》 | States most at risk of America's deadliest cancer... where does YOURS rank? - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOSHFSZkU0eTh1dUQxLVY0U1l3a3g1OU5FYjUxSjBRM1psaUZoSGpRNDg2MVQxTjY2UlZYMTRxUC1HbDNOMWVCc1RRNjBJWEszYTIySDMzaGE3X1o5RXNNemYzenUxeDZqczFjenJCQU81VnFQQUtrR1VnNXJqbnhrNGxPczdnSHhMVnQxbWhjTU9kOHNxa3hNeEJnS3LSAaIBQVVfeXFMT3laRFVRV0FfQ19mcWREbkxSTVNreDZZaTh1aThOdDh0LVAxN2tMdktUUDl2cDlMMUtlTWRJSzlfbGktWVktNHhSOFlsYjZUVktZVGJsNE5fQlZocF9zZmNOV3BLQzVQQUF6TG94cmFiWmNUcldPaWRDVFU0R054WFpaMW9PUWhIM0xkUUdKSjM3MXFxbUt3cWtIem5DLUo2Ykl3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People living in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/iowa/index.html" id="mol-baa475d0-2200-11f0-a330-01676fa8611e"&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt; may be at the greatest risk of lung &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-baa0cc50-2200-11f0-a330-01676fa8611e"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; in the next decade, a new study suggests.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-baa400a0-2200-11f0-a330-01676fa8611e"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; San Diego surveyed 1.7million Americans in all 50 states to track rates of cigarette use from 1992 through 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also used that data to predict which states would have the most smokers in 2035.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found since the early 2000s, smoking rates have decreased by more than 60 percent nationwide, from 23 percent to 9.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Statewide, Utah recorded the lowest rate of smokers in 2022 with 4.4 percent. Maine, however, had the highest smoking rate in the country at 16.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And by 2035, even as nationwide smoking rates dip to just five percent on average, experts estimate Iowa's rate - which is about 16 percent - will remain unchanged, making it the highest in the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smoking and tobacco use is the number one cause of lung cancer, responsible for 80 to 90 percent of cases. The disease is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13490375/lung-cancer-rising-young-americans.html"&gt;America's deadliest and third-most common cancer&lt;/a&gt;, with 226,000 cases per year and 130,000 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while smoking is on the decline, lung cancer rates will take significantly longer to drop in areas with heavy smoking rates, researchers warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers at the University of California San Diego have revealed which states may be at the greatest risk of developing lung cancer (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows smoking rates per state in 2022.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also cautioned an increase in vaping among young people may further stall progress.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Matthew Stone, first study author and assistant professor at the UC San Diego Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health, said: 'The rapid decline in smoking among young adults is clear evidence that the smoking epidemic will come to an end in our lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Indeed, we project that the national smoking prevalence will be under five percent by 2035. However, the much slower decline in smokers over the age of 50, particularly in previously high smoking states, will mean that the high rates of lung cancer, heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that are caused by lifelong smoking will take longer to decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers analyzed US Census Bureau data on smoking and tobacco use from 1992 to 2022, which included responses from 1.7million Americans in 54,000 households.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vast majority (78 percent) were white, and the largest age group (30 percent) was 35 to 49-year-olds.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Respondents were asked 18 times whether they had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who responded 'yes' were asked if they currently smoked every day, some days or none at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers used the survey data to calculate a smoking rate for each state from 1992 to 2022 and a projected rate for 2035. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From 1992 to 2001, the national smoking rate was 23 percent. During that time, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/utah/index.html" id="mol-8d868150-21f2-11f0-a330-01676fa8611e"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; had the lowest rate of 15 percent while &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/kentucky/index.html" id="mol-8d84fab0-21f2-11f0-a330-01676fa8611e" class=""&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; had the highest at 31 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, by 2022, smoking dropped significantly down to nine percent nationwide. Utah again had the fewest smokers that year with a rate of just 4.4 percent, while &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/maine/index.html" id="mol-61d4b740-21f5-11f0-a330-01676fa8611e" class=""&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt; had the highest at 16.4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows smoking prevalence by state in 1992. Darker colors are associated with higher smoking rates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among states with the highest smoking rates, following behind were Iowa and West Virginia both at 16 percent, Oklahoma at 15 percent and South Dakota at 14 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;States with low rates following Utah were California (5.6 percent), Colorado (six percent), Connecticut (6.5 percent) and Arizona (6.7 percent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on the current trends, the researchers predicted Hawaii would have the lowest smoking rate in 2035, with a projected rate of 1.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following close behind in the predictions were Colorado at 1.5 percent, Utah at 2.5 percent, California at 3.3 percent and New Jersey at 3.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nationally, the researchers estimated the smoking rate will dip below five percent in 2035, nearly half that of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, in 2035, Iowa is expected to have the highest smoking rate at 16 percent, followed by Oklahoma (15 percent), Wyoming and West Virginia (14 percent) and Maine (12.7 percent). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings are in line with rates of lung cancer, which are highest in Midwestern and some New England states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The national average is 54 cases per 100,000 people.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows projected smoking rates for 2035. Researchers believe the US will drop to an average smoking rate of five percent in a decade from now&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maine, which had the highest smoking rate in 2022, had the fourth-highest rate of lung cancer in 2021, at 63 cases per 100,000 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kentucky (79.3 cases per 100,000 people), West Virginia (74 per 100,000) and Mississippi (65.6 per 100,000) were all in the top three states for worst lung cancer rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iowa has a rate of 61 cases per 100,000 residents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Utah, which had the fewest smokers, had a lung cancer rate of 24.4 cases per 100,000 people in 2021.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the team found all 50 states experienced 'significant' declines in smoking, they warned the rise of vaping may stall this progress. The use of e-cigarettes among high schoolers has surged from 1.5 percent in 2011 to 27 percent in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;John Pierce, corresponding author and distinguished professor at UC San Diego, said: 'While the ongoing decline in cigarette smoking is a major public health success story, recent evidence suggests that the tobacco industry has successfully recruited a new generation of teenagers into e-cigarette use and nicotine addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Further research is needed to assess the long-term impact of this shift.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 22:29:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOSHFSZkU0eTh1dUQxLVY0U1l3a3g1OU5FYjUxSjBRM1psaUZoSGpRNDg2MVQxTjY2UlZYMTRxUC1HbDNOMWVCc1RRNjBJWEszYTIySDMzaGE3X1o5RXNNemYzenUxeDZqczFjenJCQU81VnFQQUtrR1VnNXJqbnhrNGxPczdnSHhMVnQxbWhjTU9kOHNxa3hNeEJnS3LSAaIBQVVfeXFMT3laRFVRV0FfQ19mcWREbkxSTVNreDZZaTh1aThOdDh0LVAxN2tMdktUUDl2cDlMMUtlTWRJSzlfbGktWVktNHhSOFlsYjZUVktZVGJsNE5fQlZocF9zZmNOV3BLQzVQQUF6TG94cmFiWmNUcldPaWRDVFU0R054WFpaMW9PUWhIM0xkUUdKSjM3MXFxbUt3cWtIem5DLUo2Ykl3</guid></item><item><title>确定逻辑思维的关键中心-神经科学新闻 | Critical Hub for Logical Thinking Identified - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTFBjR19QWGxlQUZkRVQydlE5X0xfZW9UdG9wN1pSSHNsNlZXSDFBWEpLazZmMUtIdmRrLWxIYzM2aWVqWWlGbDN1bGRJQkx0UDdEV0JTRE5yUGx6WXdKWGxvTG8zMlhxVENhN1lId1JIaEc4d21qdDhHYnFhel8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers have identified that the right frontal lobe plays a critical role in logical thinking and problem-solving.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine which brain areas are necessary for a certain ability, researchers study patients with brain lesions (an area of damage in the brain) caused by stroke or brain tumours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach, known as ‘lesion-deficit mapping’, is the most powerful method for localising function in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studying brain injuries can be difficult and time-consuming because researchers need a large number of patients with specific brain damage. This kind of damage can affect how a person thinks, feels, or moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, very few research centres have access to enough patients to conduct these studies effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, previous studies have mainly relied on functional imaging (fMRI) techniques in healthy individuals. However, these results can sometimes be misleading as they provide correlational rather than causal evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study, led by researchers at the UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and Department of Neuropsychology at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCLH, used lesion-deficit mapping to investigate 247 patients with unilateral focal brain lesions in either the left or right frontal (front) or posterior (back) regions of the brain. An additional 81 healthy individuals served as controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess reasoning skills in these patients, the researchers developed two new tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These included a verbal deductive reasoning task (a type of puzzle where participants are asked to find relationships between words to solve problems), which included questions such as: &lt;em&gt;“If Sarah is smarter than Diana and Sarah is smarter than Heather, is Diane smarter than Heather?”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a nonverbal analogical reasoning task (a type of puzzle where participants are asked to use pictures, shapes or numbers to figure out logical patterns and solve problems), with questions like: &lt;em&gt;“Which set of numbers is 1,2,3 most similar to – 5,6,7 or 6,5,7?”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that people with damage to the right frontal lobe had a much harder time on both tests compared to those with damage in other areas. They made about 15% more mistakes than the other patients and healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author, Dr Joseph Mole (UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and Department of Neuropsychology, UCLH) said: “Our study explores how the front right part of the brain helps people think and solve new problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also shows that our two new tests can help detect reasoning problems in individuals with brain damage, improving diagnosis and treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior author, Professor Lisa Cipolotti (UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and Department of Neuropsychology, UCLH) added: “By combining a detailed cognitive investigation in a large sample of brain damaged patients with advanced lesion mapping techniques – developed by Professor Parashkev Nachev and his team at the UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology – we have deepened our understanding of the complex and, so far, poorly understood, neural structures underlying human reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show a close connection between the right frontal brain network involved in reasoning and the right frontal brain network essential for fluid intelligence (our ability to solve problems without prior experience).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that a common area of the brain plays a critical role in both reasoning and fluid intelligence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe that these findings have significant clinical implications, as the two new tests can help identify cognitive impairments that would otherwise go undetected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With further validation and implementation, the team aim to make their new reasoning tests widely available in the NHS, addressing an unmet need for tools specifically designed for assessing right frontal lobe dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was funded by Wellcome and the National Institute for Health and Care Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre (NIHR UCLH BRC) funding scheme.

Yet, our understanding of the relationship between reasoning abilities and their neuroanatomical basis remains surprisingly limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We aimed to conduct fine-grained anatomical mapping of performance on tests of AR, DR and fluid intelligence (Gf), in a large sample of patients with unilateral focal frontal or posterior lesions and healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We assessed 247 prospectively recruited patients using two new tests: the Analogical Reasoning Test (ART) and the Deductive Reasoning Test (DRT); and the best-established measure of Gf: Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices (RAPM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-parametric Bayesian stochastic block modelling was used to reveal the community structure of lesion deficit networks, disentangling functional from confounding pathological distributed effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ART and DRT performance was significantly impaired in patients with frontal lesions [ART: &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;(2,238) = 18.93; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; Frontal group worse than Posterior group and healthy controls, both &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; DRT: &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;(2,387) = 18.491; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; Frontal group worse than healthy controls, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01]. Right frontal effects were evident on both tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, on the ART, right frontal patients were more impaired than left (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). On the DRT, right frontal patients were more impaired than left frontal patients on questions with indeterminate solutions (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) but not on questions with determinate ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-parametric Bayesian stochastic block modelling implicated a right frontal network in ART and DRT performance. Strikingly, we found that this network was also implicated in performance on RAPM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study represents the most robust investigation of AR and DR in the focally injured brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings imply that a right frontal network is critical. The ART and DRT appear to be promising new clinical tests, capable of evaluating reasoning abilities and identifying right frontal lobe dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 21:48:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTFBjR19QWGxlQUZkRVQydlE5X0xfZW9UdG9wN1pSSHNsNlZXSDFBWEpLazZmMUtIdmRrLWxIYzM2aWVqWWlGbDN1bGRJQkx0UDdEV0JTRE5yUGx6WXdKWGxvTG8zMlhxVENhN1lId1JIaEc4d21qdDhHYnFhel8</guid></item><item><title>脐带DNA可能预测未来的代谢健康风险-神经科学新闻 | Umbilical Cord DNA May Predict Future Metabolic Health Risks - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxOTDUtSE9WbGJHYW1TeWVrWVdPOURSQl9vRmRoV3FkeURIN3c5VUc3WW9SR1RQQ3ZuQjhwVDlUd2NiSG9rSzJNVENHT3pRMG5CU2c4OVgxYjl3VUhNQmtvbzdEN1ZGcnlRYUM3ampxUEg3WjZkbWlWX29vOG5ic0h6RGROWEQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;DNA changes in umbilical cord blood may help predict which children are at higher risk for future health issues like diabetes, liver disease, and stroke. Researchers analyzed chemical tags on DNA, known as methylation patterns, and linked specific alterations to markers of metabolic dysfunction later in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, changes in genes like TNS3, GNAS, and CSMD1 were tied to liver fat accumulation, high blood pressure, and abnormal waist-to-hip ratios.

They looked for changes in chemical tags — called methyl groups — on the infants’ DNA that switch genes on or off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When these switches occur in critical parts of the DNA, called imprint control regions, their effects can persist through fetal development and into later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team compared the DNA changes to health data collected when the children were 7 to 12 years old — including body mass index, liver fat, an indication of liver inflammation or damage known as alanine transaminase (ALT), triglyceride levels, blood pressure, and waist-to-hip ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They identified multiple regions of altered DNA associated with metabolic dysfunction later in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in a gene called &lt;em&gt;TNS3&lt;/em&gt; were linked to liver fat, ALT, and waist-to-hip ratio, while alterations in others, including &lt;em&gt;GNAS&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;CSMD1&lt;/em&gt;, were connected to blood pressure, waist-to-hip ratio, and ALT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These epigenetic signals are laid down during embryonic development, potentially influenced by environmental factors such as nutrition or maternal health during pregnancy,” said co-author Cynthia Moylan, MD, associate professor of medicine, division of gastroenterology, at Duke University Health System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If validated in larger studies, this could open the door to new screening tools and early interventions for at-risk children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the sample size was small, the researchers say the findings are promising and warrant further investigation. A larger National Health Institute-funded follow-up study is underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current findings do not suggest a direct cause-and-effect relationship between the genetic changes and disease but highlight a potential biological pathway for further research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just because you’re born with these markers doesn’t mean disease is inevitable,” Dr. Jowell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But knowing your risk earlier in life could help families and clinicians take proactive steps to support a child’s long-term health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this genetics and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6b050e1c18190404062b0c0a181f19044504190c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rachel Shubert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://gastro.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Digestive Disease Week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Rachel Shubert – Digestive Disease Week&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will be presented at the Digestive Disease Week 2025 conference.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 21:22:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxOTDUtSE9WbGJHYW1TeWVrWVdPOURSQl9vRmRoV3FkeURIN3c5VUc3WW9SR1RQQ3ZuQjhwVDlUd2NiSG9rSzJNVENHT3pRMG5CU2c4OVgxYjl3VUhNQmtvbzdEN1ZGcnlRYUM3ampxUEg3WjZkbWlWX29vOG5ic0h6RGROWEQ</guid></item><item><title>独家|研究发现， Z世代女性滥用兴奋剂，狂饮超过任何其他群体-纽约邮报 | Exclusive | Gen Z women abuse stimulants, binge-drink more than any other group, studies find - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxNay1uR1k3TnBWMktDLWxPTTl6bnNFLW0xWnYzOFBsZEtxdnh0SVZnOVhCXzRtU3d6M1YxOWRvNU9ObFBIVmd3Yk9kV25xMkxHQlZMc2t5NnlWMDl5Sk0tRFlvMUZpVVdSRVh5QlpQcGVFZUZ6SDMxVTlfeHc0QTFOVmo4M2tySVZ5LXZRZ2xSaHdnNFRPVWROTWk2QlQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;Gen Z women are abusing stimulants and binge drinking more than their male counterparts — and any other age group, new studies have found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nearly 37% of women ages 18 to 25 reported excessively popping uppers such as Adderall and Ritalin in the past year, more than double that reported by women older than them, according to a study published last month in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2833100?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jama.2025.4667" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;JAMA Psychiatry. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Only 25% of women ages 26 to 34 reported improper use, according to the study. Women 35 to 64, who researchers said have seen largest rise in stimulant prescriptions, are abusing them the least — 13.7%. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Nearly 37% of women aged 18 to 25 years reported misuse of prescription stimulants. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Alex DiStasi – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Men were not far behind women in abuse of the drugs, which have become so increasingly popular since 2020 that there have been national shortages. Among men ages 18 to 25 who are prescribed the medication, 36.1% reported misuse compared to 36.3% of men aged 26 to 35 and 22% of men ages 35 to 64.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 83,762 men and women ages 18 to 64 included in the study, only a quarter of them reported misusing the drugs, including taking them without being prescribed or taking higher or more frequent doses than ordered.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;While older women often pop the pills to manage daily life with families, many younger women suffer “feelings of inadequacy” for not meeting social, physical, career and relationship standards, &lt;a href="/Users/dbardolf/Downloads/21-36.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;experts say.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Amphetamines, which stimulate the dopamine reward system the most, were abused three times more. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;standret – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s pressure to have the perfect grades, perfect body, be super popular on social media, and appear to have it all figured out,” Stacey Ross, a mental health specialist at AddictionResource.net, told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Some feel like they need to be ‘on’ constantly, and that the misuse of stimulants seems like a quick solution to stay there,” Ross said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors said the findings highlight a need for prevention and intervention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They looked at the two types of drugs most commonly used to treat ADHD and help with concentration and alertness: amphetamines, which include Adderall and Vyvanse, and methylphenidates like Ritalin and Concerta. Amphetamines, which stimulate the dopamine reward system more than methylphenidates, were found to be abused three times higher.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Women were historically misdiagnosed and underdiagnosed with ADHD but the gender gap has been closing, especially since the pandemic, according to experts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Young women also reported binge drinking more than any other group, another study found. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Witoon – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The alarming findings follow reports that young women are also out-drinking men for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A study published last week in JAMA of 267,843 men and women 18 and older found that 31.6% of women ages 18 to 25 reported binge drinking — consuming four or more drinks on one occasion — more than any other group.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The study compared men’s and women’s habits over two time periods, 2017 to 2019 and 2021 to 2023. It found that men’s binge-drinking levels plummeted nearly 8 percentage points, from 37.7% to 29.9%. But women didn’t see such a drop, falling only 4.8 percent from the prior years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Societal pressures drive some women to seek pharmacological support, experts say. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;ÃÂÃÂ»ÃÂµÃÂºÃÂÃÂµÃÂ¹ ÃâÃÂ¾ÃÂ½ÃÂµÃÂ½ÃÂºÃÂ¾ – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts say heavy alcohol use has become &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acer.14690" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;more acceptable for women&lt;/a&gt; and that they are increasingly targeted through marketing and social media campaigns, especially those with higher socio-economic status.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For females, there continues to be pressure to be ‘fun,’ ‘cool,’ or ‘relaxed,’ and too often, that means drinking,” Ross said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The disturbing findings come amid an increase in alcohol-related liver disease and mortality among young- and middle-aged women than men.&lt;/p&gt;

Start your wellness journey today—order Pilly Labs Collagen Gummies and see the difference for your skin, hair, and joints.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why Collagen Is Essential for Long-Term Skin, Joint, and Hair Health&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body, acting as a primary structural component for skin, bones, joints, tendons, and connective tissues. Often referred to as the "building block of beauty and mobility," collagen provides the strength, elasticity, and resilience needed to maintain youthful skin, flexible joints, and strong, vibrant hair.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, starting as early as our mid-20s, natural collagen production begins to decline by approximately 1% each year. By the time we reach our 40s and 50s, the visible and physical effects of collagen loss become more apparent — including fine lines, sagging skin, brittle hair, joint stiffness, and overall decreased mobility. Environmental stressors such as sun exposure, pollution, poor diet, and stress further accelerate this depletion, making proactive collagen replenishment an essential part of any long-term wellness strategy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Supplementing daily with a high-quality collagen product like Pilly Labs Collagen Gummies provides a natural and effective way to restore these vital structural proteins. Unlike short-term topical solutions, collagen supplementation works from the inside out, fueling the body's ability to rebuild and regenerate critical tissues. This inside-out wellness approach not only supports a youthful appearance but also promotes better joint flexibility, stronger bones, and healthier hair over time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Choosing a hydrolyzed collagen supplement — where the collagen is broken down into smaller, more bioavailable peptides — ensures better absorption and effectiveness. Combined with key cofactors like Vitamin C, Biotin, and Zinc, collagen peptides can significantly accelerate the body's natural collagen synthesis, amplifying results for those committed to a sustainable beauty and health routine.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Incorporating a natural collagen booster into your daily self-care regimen is no longer just about aesthetics; it is now a core pillar of the functional beauty movement. A consistent intake of collagen can help maintain skin hydration, enhance joint resilience, and provide the foundation for long-term vitality and a healthier aging process.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whether your goal is a youthful glow, stronger hair, or greater mobility, understanding the role of collagen — and taking proactive steps to support it — is one of the smartest investments you can make in your long-term health and appearance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Real Benefits of Taking Pilly Labs Collagen Gummies Daily&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Consistency is the key to seeing real, transformative results from any collagen supplement. Pilly Labs Collagen Gummies are designed to support a wide range of beauty and wellness goals when taken daily over time. Whether you're focused on restoring youthful skin, strengthening your hair, or improving joint comfort, this supplement delivers noticeable improvements by working from within.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here's what consistent use of Pilly Labs Collagen Gummies can help you achieve:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For Skin: Restore Youthful Elasticity and Hydration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Collagen is essential for maintaining firm, smooth, and hydrated skin. As natural collagen production decreases with age, skin begins to show visible signs of aging, such as fine lines, wrinkles, and dryness.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Daily supplementation with Pilly Labs Collagen Gummies helps to rebuild collagen fibers beneath the surface, improving skin elasticity, reducing the appearance of fine lines, and boosting overall hydration. The inclusion of Vitamin C and Vitamin E further amplifies the skin's natural glow by supporting collagen stability and protecting against environmental damage.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For individuals committed to a natural glow-up journey, these collagen gummies offer a reliable foundation for achieving long-term skin health and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For Hair and Nails: Strengthen and Revitalize from Within&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hair thinning, brittleness, and slow growth are common signs of weakened collagen and keratin structures. Pilly Labs Collagen Gummies, enhanced with Biotin and Zinc, work synergistically to support stronger, thicker hair and resilient nails.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Biotin promotes the production of keratin, the key structural protein in hair and nails, while collagen peptides provide the amino acids necessary to nourish follicles and support healthy growth cycles. With regular use, many users report increased hair thickness, stronger nail integrity, and a reduction in breakage.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This targeted support makes Pilly Labs Collagen Gummies one of the best collagen supplements for women and men looking to enhance their natural beauty from within.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For Joints and Bones: Improve Flexibility and Comfort&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Joint discomfort and reduced mobility often accompany collagen loss over time. Collagen is critical for maintaining the integrity of cartilage, the cushioning tissue that protects joints. When collagen levels decline, joints can become stiff, less flexible, and more prone to wear and tear.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By replenishing collagen stores with bioavailable peptides, Pilly Labs Collagen Gummies support joint lubrication, flexibility, and comfort. The addition of Vitamin C and Zinc further enhances connective tissue strength, helping to protect against joint degradation and supporting an active lifestyle well into the future.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For those seeking natural arthritis support or preventative joint care, daily collagen supplementation offers a vital strategy for maintaining mobility and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For Overall Health and Longevity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Beyond aesthetic benefits, collagen peptides contribute to overall wellness by supporting muscle mass, promoting gut health, strengthening bones, and even improving cardiovascular function. As part of a holistic wellness stack, Pilly Labs Collagen Gummies aligns with the growing trend of inside-out wellness, where beauty and health are treated as interconnected goals.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Making collagen supplementation part of your daily routine isn't about more than addressing current concerns—it's about investing in your long-term vitality, resilience, and confidence.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=7Bsp0RyUwajdzP_MY2Q51WipLII9Raj4Ow-BZqb_YQLUAiqwdH0Np05c2V8ZIqdfA-bYSGvfhGHcpzT0Rt3q4N0de-eFaRguVzGuRkzdfQz4LWGdIqGzBc87ssRjqjSDfbSAkWz-V7bDxG5QlGoEpS6zIcr1PYOZ1AsLr_rucGFmLhmgbOL101vi8-p7Iuxcf2xz5uP6MQChAxFHBgBsxv_KwslEQB3quxhedeCC2O0TSIwMkGM8ZMzcsJ46TCPyXHfFwXSRXEembCx7jX60Fl0qIbwOZ7l5NmKCu5wweucXK7W6BeuT4rFdsM-9-lz55S-W5SFaV73BDaD8rgwzbg==" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discover why so many are choosing Pilly Labs for their daily self-care. Ready for real results? Buy Pilly Labs Collagen Gummies now and support your beauty and mobility from within.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why Pilly Labs Collagen Gummies Are Different from Other Collagen Products&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a growing market flooded with collagen powders, capsules, and gummies, it's necessary to understand what sets Pilly Labs Collagen Gummies apart from the rest. Not all collagen supplements deliver the same results, and the difference often lies in the quality of ingredients, the formulation strategy, and the overall commitment to clean, effective wellness.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here's why Pilly Labs Collagen Gummies stand out as one of the best collagen supplements available today:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marine-Based Collagen for Higher Purity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Pilly Labs sources its collagen from marine collagen peptides, which are widely regarded as one of the purest and most bioavailable forms of collagen. Marine collagen has a smaller particle size compared to bovine or porcine collagen, making it easier for the body to absorb and utilize efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This enhanced absorption means users are more likely to see faster and more noticeable improvements in skin elasticity, joint flexibility, and hair strength — a critical advantage for anyone serious about natural beauty and inside-out wellness.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enhanced Absorption with Targeted Nutrients&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Collagen alone isn't enough. For the body to synthesize and stabilize new collagen fibers effectively, it needs key cofactors like Vitamin C, Biotin, and Zinc. Pilly Labs Collagen Gummies are formulated with these essential nutrients to maximize the impact of every serving.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By supporting the complete collagen production cycle, Pilly Labs ensures users aren't just consuming collagen — they are optimizing the conditions necessary for long-term results.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clean Beauty Commitment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today's consumers demand more than just effectiveness; they want clean, sustainable, and ethically sourced products. Pilly Labs Collagen Gummies are non-GMO, gluten-free, antibiotic-free, and made without artificial flavors or colors. Natural fruit extracts like purple carrot juice are used for flavor and color, supporting the clean beauty and sustainable wellness movements.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This transparency and dedication to ingredient quality help build long-term trust with consumers who prioritize health-conscious, responsible living.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Delicious, Convenient, and Easy to Use&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional collagen powders that require mixing or unappealing capsules that are difficult to swallow, Pilly Labs Collagen Gummies offer a simple and enjoyable experience. The delicious fruit-flavored gummies are easy to incorporate into any daily routine, making consistency — the most critical factor in seeing tangible results — far more achievable.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This combination of effectiveness, convenience, and taste removes the most significant barriers to success with collagen supplementation, helping users stay committed to their 90-day, 6-month, or 12-month glow-up journeys.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When it comes to investing in your long-term skin, joint, and hair health, quality matters. Pilly Labs Collagen Gummies delivers a comprehensive solution that not only meets but exceeds the standards of modern wellness, making them an ideal choice for anyone ready to embrace a functional beauty approach and sustainable self-care practices.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Choosing a collagen supplement isn't just about immediate results — it's about building habits that nourish and support your body for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to Use Pilly Labs Collagen Gummies for Best Results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Taking collagen consistently is the key to unlocking its full range of benefits for skin, joints, hair, and overall health. Pilly Labs Collagen Gummies are specifically formulated to make daily collagen supplementation simple, enjoyable, and sustainable for the long term.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here's how to use them effectively to maximize your results:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suggested Daily Dosage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For optimal outcomes, it is recommended to take &lt;strong&gt;two Pilly Labs Collagen Gummies per day&lt;/strong&gt;. This daily serving delivers a potent dose of hydrolyzed collagen peptides, along with Vitamin C, Biotin, Zinc, and Vitamin E, ensuring that your body has the building blocks it needs to support collagen synthesis and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The gummies can be taken at any time of day, with or without food. Many users find it convenient to incorporate them into their morning routine or as a midday wellness boost.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Building a Long-Term Habit for Maximum Benefits&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While some improvements in skin hydration and hair strength may be noticeable within a few weeks, the most profound transformations typically occur over a longer timeframe. Collagen works cumulatively within the body, and actual regenerative changes often take consistent effort over months.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For best results, consider following one of these wellness timelines:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;90-Day Collagen Challenge:&lt;/strong&gt; Establish a new beauty and wellness routine. Noticeable improvements in skin texture, joint comfort, and hair vitality often begin appearing around the three-month mark.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6-Month Renewal Plan:&lt;/strong&gt; Deeper structural support. With six months of continuous collagen supplementation, users typically report firmer skin, stronger nails, fuller hair, and improved joint flexibility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12-Month Lifestyle Transformation:&lt;/strong&gt; Long-term inside-out wellness.

Pilly Labs Collagen Gummies have quickly earned a loyal following from customers who have committed to consistent use and reaped the full benefits of inside-out wellness.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here's what real users are saying about their glow-up journeys with Pilly Labs:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skin Transformation Stories&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many users report noticeable improvements in skin texture, hydration, and elasticity within the first 90 days of consistent use. Fine lines appear softer, skin feels firmer, and an overall youthful glow returns.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"After three months of taking Pilly Labs Collagen Gummies, my skin feels hydrated all day, and my laugh lines have noticeably faded. People keep asking me what I'm doing differently." — Sarah, 42&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I've tried creams and serums for years, but nothing gave me results like this. My skin genuinely looks healthier from the inside out." — Jasmine, 36&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hair and Nail Revitalization&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Strengthening hair and nails from within is another area where Pilly Labs users see outstanding improvements. Regular supplementation provides the building blocks needed for stronger, shinier hair and more resilient nails.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"My hair was thinning badly before. Six months into my collagen routine, my hair is thicker, shinier, and even my hairstylist noticed." — Michelle, 49&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I used to have brittle nails that would never grow. Now they're strong and healthy — I don't even need fake nails anymore." — Amanda, 33&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Joint and Mobility Improvements&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For those concerned about joint health, daily collagen intake has made a visible difference in flexibility, comfort, and ease of movement.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I'm in my early 50s and started noticing knee stiffness. After four months on Pilly Labs Collagen Gummies, my knees feel better than they have in years. I'm hiking again without pain." — Robert, 53&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Yoga was getting difficult due to joint discomfort. Collagen supplementation gave me my flexibility back." — Emily, 47&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Long-Term Wellness Success&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Customers who commit to the 6-month or 12-month collagen renewal plans report feeling more confident, energized, and empowered to maintain a healthy, vibrant lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Taking Pilly Labs Collagen Gummies became part of my self-care routine. After a full year, my skin, joints, hair — everything feels stronger. It's a small habit that made a massive difference." — Monica, 58&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why Testimonials Matter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hearing the real-world experiences of others helps reinforce the tangible benefits of consistent collagen supplementation. These testimonials not only highlight the visible transformations users are achieving but also inspire new customers to believe that lasting change is possible with a natural collagen booster.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When you combine a potent formula with consistent use and healthy lifestyle habits, the results speak for themselves — and Pilly Labs Collagen Gummies continue to prove it with every success story.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Science Behind Collagen Supplementation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While personal success stories are inspiring, scientific research provides the foundation that validates collagen supplementation as a legitimate strategy for promoting long-term skin, joint, and hair health. Understanding the science behind collagen peptides helps explain why consistent daily intake is such a powerful tool for those committed to inside-out wellness.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Collagen and Skin Health&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Multiple clinical studies have demonstrated that supplementing with hydrolyzed collagen peptides can significantly improve skin hydration, elasticity, and texture. A landmark study published in &lt;em&gt;Skin Pharmacology and Physiology&lt;/em&gt; found that participants who consumed collagen peptides daily for eight weeks experienced a measurable reduction in wrinkle depth and an improvement in skin elasticity compared to a placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The mechanism is straightforward: collagen peptides stimulate fibroblast cells in the skin to produce more collagen and elastin fibers, leading to smoother, firmer skin from within. When combined with Vitamin C — a critical cofactor in collagen production — the results are amplified, supporting a natural, sustainable glow-up.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Collagen and Joint Flexibility&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Research published in the &lt;em&gt;Current Medical Research and Opinion Journal&lt;/em&gt; shows that collagen supplementation can also significantly reduce joint discomfort and improve flexibility, especially in individuals experiencing age-related joint degeneration or those engaging in strenuous physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hydrolyzed collagen has been shown to accumulate in cartilage tissue and stimulate the production of type II collagen, the primary structural protein in joints. This improves cushioning, reduces friction, and promotes greater comfort during movement — aligning perfectly with the goal of maintaining active lifestyles well into later years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Collagen and Hair Growth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While research on collagen and hair is emerging, early studies and clinical observations suggest that collagen's role in supporting the dermal layers of the scalp is critical for maintaining strong, healthy hair follicles. In combination with Biotin and Zinc, collagen supplementation creates an optimal environment for hair strength, resilience, and growth.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Users consistently report improvements in hair thickness, shininess, and reduced breakage after several months of consistent collagen intake, which aligns with the natural life cycle of hair growth phases.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Scientific evidence supports what many users experience firsthand: collagen supplementation, when properly formulated and taken consistently, has measurable benefits for skin appearance, joint health, and hair vitality.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Pilly Labs Collagen Gummies are crafted to meet the exact conditions shown in clinical studies to be effective—providing hydrolyzed collagen peptides, Vitamin C, Biotin, Zinc, and Vitamin E in an easy-to-use daily format. By aligning real-world use with scientific best practices, Pilly Labs empowers users to achieve meaningful, lasting results through natural collagen-boosting strategies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=H0MzqT7cQljAASZBuwxz0POuW7JpcDoo8eCwFaC5eGzOHid3wGKb6aKkIEQ_EJde7my9P4osMf-djsG07bdKoYemyclmyFr8SSC0SekQtsek2LeTC8ZFAuMlZ8O1czOyjZffHrxs5lC9oKiHYgojFmXP_HrkUVlGtvd6lHBA6_ruzQeHfRv0XosQxA_jlqPtjsdS-qMYv5iKeN9p0g-Lw9J5iGVulEsRxXya9jC3biYFhn_2C5q_F_RlV98AW3yMFK-c3VjkClVUEy0Y-lxFi4u073FHFpUfSHwdNuvpL0pUnU1FrirC9KVlhEldvTCuYZpkCeyKshhTq46Q-qivjw==" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See visible improvements as you stick to your new collagen routine.

&lt;p&gt;In the last several years, masks have been recognized as a crucial tool in safeguarding public health, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, with the chaos of public rioting across universities and public spaces, many jurisdictions are considering wearing a mask as a criminal offense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, democratic governor &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/05/new-yorks-push-to-restrict-masks-is-dividing-democrats-00274350" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/05/new-yorks-push-to-restrict-masks-is-dividing-democrats-00274350" aria-label="Kathy Hochul"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/05/new-yorks-push-to-restrict-masks-is-dividing-democrats-00274350"&gt;Kathy Hochul&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is pushing legislation to effectively make masking a criminal violation for those that threaten violence. The legislation would make exceptions for those with health safety concerns, work requirements and inclement weather, to name a few. &lt;a href="https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/story/texas-senators-consider-bills-effectively-banning-masks-in-protests" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/story/texas-senators-consider-bills-effectively-banning-masks-in-protests" aria-label="Texas senators"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/story/texas-senators-consider-bills-effectively-banning-masks-in-protests"&gt;Texas senators&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are also introducing bills that would ban masks and criminalize those who use them to harass, intimidate and threaten others. Many other jurisdictions have already banned masks for similar reasons including North Carolina and Nassau County in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While security considerations are important, banning masks could have detrimental consequences for public health. Masks are a proven means to reduce the transmission of respiratory illnesses as well as their acquisition. They do so by trapping airborne particles like viral particles that get expelled when people talk, cough or sneeze. This is precisely why masking was recommended and in some cases mandated during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, masks also help people from inhaling toxic chemicals and substances from air pollution, which is an important concern during wildfires and areas with high soot pollution. Particle pollution from wildfires emit &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/omerawan/2025/01/11/how-wildfires-can-affect-human-health/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/omerawan/2025/01/11/how-wildfires-can-affect-human-health/" target="_self" aria-label="small particles"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/omerawan/2025/01/11/how-wildfires-can-affect-human-health/"&gt;small particles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and irritants that can get deposited in the lungs and predispose to chronic medical conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease. Masks can provide a much needed barrier and deterrent for many of these small particles that are harmful to health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medical research overwhelmingly supports the use of masks to mitigate the spread of infections diseases. A plethora of &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2014564118" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2014564118" aria-label="research"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2014564118"&gt;research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that facemasks reduce transmission of infected respiratory particles in both laboratory and clinical contexts. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/masks.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/masks.html" aria-label="CDC"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/masks.html"&gt;CDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also states, “When worn by a person with infection, masks reduce the spread of the virus to others. Masks also protect wearers from breathing in infectious particles from people around them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although legislation of mask bans makes exceptions for those with health conditions, these exceptions are difficult to enforce and implement practically. &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/05/new-yorks-push-to-restrict-masks-is-dividing-democrats-00274350" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/05/new-yorks-push-to-restrict-masks-is-dividing-democrats-00274350" aria-label="Law enforcement"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/05/new-yorks-push-to-restrict-masks-is-dividing-democrats-00274350"&gt;Law enforcement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; officials are only allowed by law to ask about religion or health if an action pertains specifically to the crime in question. This can be difficult to enforce, and creates an uncomfortable environment for the many immunocompromised patients that require masks to protect their health. Asking these individuals about masking and to potentially take it off is an invasion of their health and privacy that should be protected by HIPAA laws. Remember, those who are immunocompromised are much more common than you may think and include cancer patients who are on chemotherapy, those who take steroids, organ transplant recipients as well as those with chronic medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, if mask bans are successfully implemented, those that need to mask may be forced into social isolation. Many may fear being incarcerated and could be reluctant to leave their homes. Businesses could deny service to those wearing masks, which would include immunocompromised people and patients with disabilities. Mask bans create unnecessary bias and discrimination against our most vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although politicians that seek to ban masks may have good intentions in attempting to reduce crime, public health policy must prioritize the well-being of the entire population while considering broader societal concerns. Banning masks ignores the essential role they play in mitigating the spread of deadly infectious diseases. At a time where science and health have been largely politicized, America needs leaders that will fight for the well-being of all its citizens.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Julie Lam, founder of Mask Together America and mask advocate, says, “Now I am forced to be on medication that’s making me immune compromised, more susceptible to hospitalization from infection, my immunologist warned me. I am out there protesting, wearing a mask, not to make a spectacle but to send a message that we need to rise up and say no to our government defunding public health.”&lt;/p&gt;

Our brain reacts and certainly seems to put extra weight on signals that say something bad might be coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research, conducted by &lt;a href="https://www.iasp-pain.org/person/ulrike-bingel-md-phd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Ulrike Bingel&lt;/a&gt; at the University Hospital Essen, tackled a puzzle that has long kept experts on their toes. They wanted to know why negative suggestions bring on stronger responses than positive ones when it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tapping-into-the-pain-relief-potential-of-cannabis-without-the-high/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-power-of-suggestion-placebo-and-nocebo"&gt;Power of suggestion: Placebo and nocebo&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Placebo describes a helpful effect triggered by positive expectations of relief. Nocebo is its darker twin, sparking an increase in symptoms just from negative thoughts about a treatment or situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An earlier &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21862825/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; showed nocebo responses happen even when a person only hears warnings about possible side effects. Scientists point out that this is linked to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/lsd-can-treat-crippling-anxiety-with-a-single-dose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and attention, which can spike with a single negative comment from a trusted source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-relief-fades-faster-than-fear"&gt;Why relief fades faster than fear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positive experiences, like a drop in pain, often feel less memorable than unpleasant ones. Studies suggest that our minds don’t replay comfort with the same intensity or frequency as they do discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/spiders-heights-or-public-speaking-each-fear-has-a-unique-place-in-the-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt; and discomfort seem to leave a deeper mark. That’s likely because the brain treats them as warnings to remember and avoid in the future – making comfort easier to forget and fear harder to shake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-negative-cues-stick-more"&gt;Why negative cues stick more&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts explain that our minds are wired to keep us safe. That may explain why nocebo cues are remembered so strongly, even when we have only experienced them once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Significant placebo and nocebo effects were detected on day 1 and day 8, but nocebo effects were stronger on both test days,” reported Bingel. This tendency ties into an evolutionary idea often called the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810014001962" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;‘better safe than sorry’&lt;/a&gt; strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-brain-s-bias-toward-bad-news"&gt;The brain’s bias toward bad news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research in neuroscience shows that the brain tends to light up more, reacting more to threats than to rewards. This reaction happens quickly, sometimes even before we fully realize what we’re reacting to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could explain why even a subtle negative expectation – like the possibility that something might hurt – grabs our attention and sticks with us. It’s not just emotional; it’s wired into how our nervous system responds to the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-role-does-personal-experience-play"&gt;What role does personal experience play&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When individuals feel pain is eased, that personal experience can shape what they expect next time. But if a past situation suggested pain might get worse, that memory can loom large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scholars note that repeated experiences of pain reduction can slowly build trust in a treatment. Yet if negative signals stand out more, they may overshadow positive ones, which makes neutral or even reassuring messages seem less convincing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-practitioner-connection-and-beliefs"&gt;Practitioner connection and beliefs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a care provider seems highly competent, that might unintentionally boost nocebo responses when they mention potential downsides. Patients may trust them so much that any warning sounds like a sure threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain traits, like &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2090830/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;somatosensory amplification&lt;/a&gt; (tendency to notice and worry about physical sensations), also appear to tamp down the strength of a placebo effect. During short lab tests, participants with that tendency seemed less likely to feel relief from positive suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-possible-ways-to-address-nocebo-effects"&gt;Possible ways to address nocebo effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communication strategies that reduce needless worries may ease nocebo effects. Simple changes to phrasing can shift focus away from worst-case scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addressing everyday &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stress-eats-away-our-brains-cognitive-defenses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt; might help, too. Since anxious thoughts feed negative expectations, steps to calm the mind can prevent nocebo responses before they snowball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nocebo effects don’t just cause discomfort in the moment – they may also change the way people act in the future. If someone links a harmless activity or medication with pain or side effects, they might start avoiding it altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, this avoidance can build into broader patterns like skipping doctor visits, refusing useful treatments, or becoming wary of all health interventions.

These findings, the researchers say, support an emerging scientific theory that viruses which affect the nervous system, like shingles, can increase the chances of having dementia — therefore, being inoculated against the virus could have the opposite effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“For the first time, we now have evidence that likely shows a cause-and-effect relationship between shingles vaccination and dementia prevention,”&lt;/strong&gt; says &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/pascal-geldsetzer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pascal Geldsetzer M.D., Ph.D., M.P.H;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Pascal Geldsetzer M.D., Ph.D., M.P.H&lt;/a&gt;., assistant professor of medicine at Stanford University and the study’s senior author. “We find these protective effects to be large in size, substantially larger than those of existing pharmacological tools for dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for a way to maintain a healthy brain, keep reading to learn more about both the shingles vaccine and the surprising findings of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is shingles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shingles (herpes zoster) occurs when the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) — the one that causes chickenpox — reactivates in the body.&lt;/strong&gt; If you had chickenpox, the virus remains dormant in your nerve cells and can rear its head during adulthood. &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/shingles/#frequency" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:According to the NIH;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;According to the NIH&lt;/a&gt;, shingles affects between 20 to 30% of people during their lives, and is most prevalent in people ages 50 and older. This can be chalked up to our immune systems weakening with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have shingles most commonly experience a painful, itchy or tingly rash on one side of the face or body. The rash comes in the form of blisters that will scab over within 7 to 10 days. With shingles, you may also have fever, headaches, chills or an upset stomach, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/signs-symptoms/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC). Treatments include antiviral medications, OTC or prescription pain relievers, and self-care home remedies such as applying wet compresses, calamine lotion and taking warm oatmeal baths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've had chickenpox, the only way to safeguard yourself from shingles is to receive the Shingrix vaccine, which the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/vaccines/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; recommends for adults 50 and over, and anyone 19 and over who are immunocompromised as a result of disease or therapy. Shingrix comes in two doses, with the second one given two to six months after the first shot. The CDC reports the vaccine is more than 90% effective at preventing shingles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you know why getting the vaccine is key for shingles prevention, and thanks to this study, we know have some viable evidence it can also help ward off cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the study found&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Geldsetzer and his colleagues rooted their study in the interest of wanting a more up-close look between the shingles vaccine and its relation to the onset of dementia. It’s not that prior studies on the topic didn’t exist, but those studies compared people who chose to get the vaccine compared to those who didn't, and these groups usually differ in lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise, which are difficult to measure. This can bias the analyses and in general, the evidence isn't solid enough to make recommendations on, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What sets the Stanford study apart is the researchers’ different approach, choosing to focus on, and compare the likelihood of dementia in people who received the shingles vaccine because they were born on, or just a few days later than September 2, 1933, which made them eligible versus those who were born just a few days earlier, and so therefore, weren't eligible for the shingles vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers based their findings on data from a Welsh shingles vaccine rollout that started on September 1, 2013. Because Wales needed to ration the vaccine’s limited supply, they used that cutoff date to decide who could get the vaccine and who couldn't. After analyzing the health records of the more than 280,000 Welsh adults who didn’t have dementia at the start of the vaccination program, a striking difference emerged between the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To our amazement, we found that &lt;strong&gt;receiving the shingles vaccine reduced the chance of being diagnosed with dementia in the subsequent seven years by roughly 20%,”&lt;/strong&gt; says Dr. Geldsetzer. “If this is truly a causal effect, then getting the shingles vaccine would be much more effective in delaying or preventing dementia than any existing pharmacological tools.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another interesting discovery? The vaccine's protective effect was greater in women than in men. “This could potentially be due to sex differences in the immune response or in the way in which dementia develops,” Dr. Geldsetzer says. “Women on average have higher antibody responses to vaccination, for example. We also know that both shingles and dementia are more common in women than in men.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Welsh findings, the Stanford team has looked at health records from shingles vaccine rollouts from other countries, including England, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. In dataset after dataset, the researchers continued to notice the vaccine was a strong protective signal for dementia, showing the link wasn’t a fluke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why this study matters &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This research is newsworthy because the shingles vaccine can now be looked at as a possible intervention in helping us to prevent or push dementia to later time,”&lt;/strong&gt; says &lt;a href="https://doctors.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/provider/manisha-santosh-parulekar/1319173" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Manisha Parulekar, M.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Manisha Parulekar, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., a geriatrician and director of the division of geriatrics and co-director of the Center for Memory Loss and Brain Health at Hackensack University Medical Center in Hackensack, NJ. “We don’t have a lot of current [intervention] options out there, and the 20% reduction in dementia risk is the best we’ve seen so far.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Parulekar says she understands the importance of the study in relation to how the shingles virus can have a negative effect on the brain. “The reactivation of the chickenpox virus can trigger significant inflammation in the nervous system, potentially damaging neurons in the brain and contributing to cognitive decline,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers still don't know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; the shingles vaccine protects against dementia. It could help by stimulating your immune system, specifically reducing reactivation of the chickenpox virus, or by some other mechanism, notes Dr. Geldsetzer, who is currently trying to raise funds from private and philanthropic foundations to conduct further research. “We want to be able to do a clinical trial to definitively test if a shingles vaccination prevents or delays dementia, so if there’s anyone out there who might be interested in funding such a trial, I’d love to hear from them,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re 50 or older, and you haven’t yet gotten your shingles vaccine, get it, and be sure to follow through with both doses for the maximum benefits, recommends Dr. Parulekar.&lt;/strong&gt; “Not only can the vaccine protect you from the painful symptoms of shingles, but now there’s one more reason, and that’s to possibly lower the risk of dementia,” she adds. “Why take a chance when we have a very effective tool available? Age is a risk factor for both, so you always want to be in preventative mode.” In other words, your shingles vaccine is a win-win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 15:47:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTFBXUEV4eEo1WklIdlBwMnROcC14cnZjTTJIRXB6Q1pZQ2J3MHNZS1pQRlBMVmZ1MFd6MmszYldWbUViS004UlRxM01wdndSN2hlclZqQ2ZfUDE4WTlOSUxEYkc4THZvajdPX3c</guid></item><item><title>遗传医学可以让人们留下罕见的突变。但也有新的希望-美联社新闻 | Genetic medicine can leave people with rare mutations behind.

Researchers found that maternal stress altered entire families of tRNA fragments in umbilical cord blood, particularly those regulating acetylcholine, a key neurotransmitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes were most dramatic in female newborns and were linked to an imbalance in stress regulation mechanisms. The findings highlight the importance of addressing maternal mental health for the lifelong wellbeing of children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex-Specific Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Maternal stress caused more dramatic molecular changes in female newborns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cholinergic System Disruption:&lt;/strong&gt; Stress reprogrammed tRNA fragments regulating acetylcholine, affecting brain and immune function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Detection Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Machine learning could classify exposed newborns with 95% accuracy based on molecular profiles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Hebrew University of Jerusalem&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study led by Prof. Hermona Soreq and Shani Vaknine Treidel from the Edmond and Lily Safra Center of Brain Science (ELSC) at Hebrew University, uncovers how stress experienced during pregnancy can affect newborns at the molecular level – with significant differences between male and female babies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry,&lt;/em&gt; focused on perceived prenatal stress (PPS) – the mother’s own sense of psychological stress during pregnancy – and discovered that it can reprogram key molecular pathways in the baby’s body, especially those linked to the cholinergic system, which governs stress response and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109192"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a pregnant woman and DNA." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These molecular changes could help explain why children exposed to high maternal stress during pregnancy may be more vulnerable to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions later in life. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that even before babies take their first breath, the stress their mothers experience can shape how their bodies manage stress themselves,” said Prof. Soreq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team analyzed umbilical cord blood from babies born to mothers who reported high stress levels during the third trimester. They focused on small RNA molecules called tRNA fragments (tRFs), which regulate gene expression much like microRNAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they found was remarkable: the stress didn’t just alter individual tRFs—it affected entire families of tRFs, particularly those with origins in mitochondrial DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes were sex-specific, with female newborns showing the most dramatic shifts, including a near-complete decline in specific mitochondrial tRFs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these tRFs, termed “CholinotRFs,” target genes that govern acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter essential for both brain function and immune regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also measured levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newborns of stressed mothers—especially boys—had significantly higher levels of AChE, suggesting an imbalance in their stress-response system right from birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These molecular changes could help explain why children exposed to high maternal stress during pregnancy may be more vulnerable to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using machine learning techniques, the researchers were able to accurately classify female newborns as exposed or unexposed to maternal stress based on their CholinotRF profiles, achieving a classification success rate (AUC) of 95%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This opens the door to new diagnostic tools for detecting prenatal stress effects and possibly even early interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study provides a powerful glimpse into how the maternal environment can leave a lasting biological imprint on the next generation,” said Vaknine Treidel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also underscores the importance of recognizing and supporting mental health during pregnancy—not just for the mother, but for the lifelong health of the child.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was conducted as part of the international FELICITy project, in collaboration with the Technical University of Munich and the University of Washington, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood samples were collected from over 120 mother-infant pairs and analyzed at the Hebrew University’s Center for Genomic Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2

prenatal stress induces sex-dependent changes in tRNA fragment families and cholinergic pathways in newborns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maternal perceived prenatal stress (PPS) is a known risk factor for diverse developmental impairments in newborns, but the underlying molecular processes are incompletely understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we report that maternal PPS altered the birth profiles of blood transfer RNA fragments (tRFs), 16–50 nt long non-random cleavage products of tRNAs, in a sex-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, comparing stressed versus control maternal and umbilical cord blood serum presented alterations that were not limited to individual tRFs, but rather reflected selective changes in particular tRF families grouped by their mitochondrial or nuclear genome origin, parental tRNA coded amino acid, and cleavage type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, tRF families that show stress- and sex-specific effects, revealed shared length and expression patterns which were strongest in the female newborns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several of these tRFs carry complementary motifs to particular cholinergic mRNAs, suggesting possible translational regulation similar to microRNAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compatible with the cholinergic regulation of stress reactions, those “CholinotRFs” achieved an AUC of 95% when classifying female newborns according to maternal PPS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, we found altered catalytic activity of serum acetylcholinesterase, which was particularly elevated in male newborns, marking a second sex-specific effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings demonstrate an association of tRF families’ patterns with newborns’ sex-specific stress response to PPS and may lead to better diagnosis and therapeutic tools

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;With warmer weather, we get to see nature's beautiful flowers emerging, but with some of these beauties comes a nuisance that we all dispise, mosquitoes. What's worse is that some of these flowers attract more of these pests than others, like the vibrant Bromeliaceae. With 56 genera and over 3000 species, this vast group is commonly referred to as bromeliads. And tank bromeliads, specifically with their tubular water-collecting system, are a mosquito-attracting flowering plant that you might not want to grow in your yard; you'll want to avoid adding these flowers to your garden at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While bromeliads are one of the &lt;a href="https://www.housedigest.com/1775937/best-plants-maximalist-home/" target="_blank"&gt;most dramatic plants for your maximalist home&lt;/a&gt;, some types like the tank bromeliad are also a mosquito-attracting flower that will cause you more annoyance and harm than you'd like. This vibrant variety has a downside of holding enough water for mosquitoes to breed. All mosquito eggs need is water to hatch, so this standing water is the perfect hiding spot for them. In just a few days, they become adult mosquitoes, free to fly everywhere, spreading diseases like Zika or yellow fever. Just because tank bromeliads attract this pesky bug, doesn't mean that you can't stop them from using your plant to breed. You can do this by hosing down your flowers to flush out the eggs, spraying your plants with vegetable oil to suffocate the larvae, or adding larvicide treatment to your water supply. Why do all these extra steps, when you can deter the amount of these pests in your yard by planting a naturally mosquito repelling plant — marigolds.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Just like bromeliads, marigolds are a beautiful, vibrant flower that looks amazing in your yard. However, the difference is that &lt;a href="https://www.housedigest.com/1336527/many-benefits-planting-marigolds-garden-insect-repellent-pollinator/" target="_blank"&gt;planting marigolds in your garden&lt;/a&gt; also offers several benefits, including its mosquito-repelling properties, anti-inflammatory effects, and its use as a natural food coloring or garnish. These bright flowers release a strong odor that not only repels mosquitoes but also other pests, such as deer and rabbits. Marigolds have a USDA hardiness zone of 2 through 11, making them a great choice for planting in many different states, including those with high mosquito populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep away mosquitoes and attract pollinators like butterflies and bees, it is best to plant marigolds as a border around your garden. You can also plant them throughout the garden, but give them about 10 inches of space between each one. You'll also want to have well-drained soil in your garden so that marigolds can thrive and mosquitoes don't have stagnant water to breed in. Plants aren't always a surefire way to repel mosquitoes; instead, consider using rubbing alcohol or even coffee grounds, as they are &lt;a href="https://www.housedigest.com/1465279/household-staples-repel-mosquitos-pest/" target="_blank"&gt;household staples that repel these biting insects like magic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Scientists found that aging triggers adipocyte progenitor cells (APCs) to evolve into committed preadipocytes, age-specific (CP-As), which actively generate new fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A signaling pathway called LIFR was found to drive this fat-cell proliferation. These findings could lead to future therapies targeting CP-As to prevent age-related fat gain and metabolic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Fat-Making Cells:&lt;/strong&gt; Aging triggers the emergence of CP-A cells that produce abundant new fat cells.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Pathway Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; The LIFR signaling pathway fuels fat cell formation specifically in middle age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Therapy Target:&lt;/strong&gt; Blocking CP-As could help reduce age-related belly fat and extend healthspan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;City of Hope&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s no secret that our waistlines often expand in middle-age, but the problem isn’t strictly cosmetic. Belly fat accelerates aging and slows down metabolism, increasing our risk for developing diabetes, heart problems and other chronic diseases. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly how age transforms a six pack into a softer stomach, however, is murky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now preclinical research by City of Hope, one of the largest and most advanced cancer research and treatment organizations in the United States and a leading research center for diabetes and other life-threatening illnesses, has uncovered the cellular culprit behind age-related abdominal fat, providing new insights into why our midsections widen with middle age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109188"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two overweight men." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;To test their hypothesis, the researchers focused on adipocyte progenitor cells (APCs), a group of stem cells in WAT that evolve into fat cells. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published today in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, the findings suggest a novel target for future therapies to prevent belly flab and extend our healthy lifespans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People often lose muscle and gain body fat as they age—even when their body weight remains the same,” said Qiong (Annabel) Wang, Ph.D., the study’s co-corresponding author and an associate professor of molecular and cellular endocrinology at City of Hope’s Arthur Riggs Diabetes &amp;amp; Metabolism Research Institute, one of the world’s foremost scientific organizations dedicated to investigating the biology and treatment of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We discovered aging triggers the arrival of a new type of adult stem cell and enhances the body’s massive production of new fat cells, especially around the belly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with the UCLA laboratory co-corresponding author Xia Yang, Ph.D., the scientists conducted a series of mouse experiments later validated on human cells. Wang and her colleagues focused on white adipose tissue (WAT), the fatty tissue responsible for age-related weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s well-known that fat cells grow larger with age, the scientists suspected that WAT also expanded by producing new fat cells, meaning it may have an unlimited potential to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their hypothesis, the researchers focused on adipocyte progenitor cells (APCs), a group of stem cells in WAT that evolve into fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The City of Hope team first transplanted APCs from young and older mice into a second group of young mice. The APCs from the older animals rapidly generated a colossal amount of fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the team transplanted APCs from young mice into the older mice, however, the stem cells did not manufacture many new fat cells. The results confirmed that older APCs are equipped to independently make new fat cells, regardless of their host’s age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using single-cell RNA sequencing, the scientists next compared APC gene activity in young and older mice. While barely active in young mice, APCs woke up with a vengeance in middle-aged mice and began pumping out new fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While most adult stem cells’ capacity to grow wanes with age, the opposite holds true with APCs — aging unlocks these cells’ power to evolve and spread,” said Adolfo Garcia-Ocana, Ph.D., the Ruth B. &amp;amp; Robert K. Lanman Endowed Chair in Gene Regulation &amp;amp; Drug Discovery Research and chair of the Department of Molecular &amp;amp; Cellular Endocrinology at City of Hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first evidence that our bellies expand with age due to the APCs’ high output of new fat cells.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aging also transformed the APCs into a new type of stem cell called committed preadipocytes, age-specific (CP-As). Arising in middle age, CP-A cells actively churn out new fat cells, explaining why older mice gain more weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A signaling pathway called leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) proved critical for promoting these CP-A cells to multiply and evolve into fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We discovered that the body’s fat-making process is driven by LIFR. While young mice don’t require this signal to make fat, older mice do,” explained Wang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research indicates that LIFR plays a crucial role in triggering CP-As to create new fat cells and expand belly fat in older mice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using single-cell RNA sequencing on samples from people of various ages, Wang and her colleagues next studied APCs from human tissue in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, the team also identified similar CP-A cells that had an increased number in middle-aged people’s tissue. Their discovery also illustrates that CP-As in humans have high capacity in creating new fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings highlight the importance of controlling new fat-cell formation to address age-related obesity,” said Wang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding the role of CP-As in metabolic disorders and how these cells emerge during aging could lead to new medical solutions for reducing belly fat and improving health and longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will focus on tracking CP-A cells in animal models, observing CP-A cells in humans and developing new strategies that eliminate or block the cells to prevent age-related fat gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s first authors are City of Hope’s Guan Wang, Ph.D., and UCLA’s Gaoyan Li, Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this weight gain and aging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#58343d35392a292d3d22183b373076372a3f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Letisia Marquez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://coh.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;City of Hope&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Letisia Marquez – City of Hope&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adj0430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Distinct adipose progenitor cells emerging with age drive active adipogenesis&lt;/a&gt;” by Qiong A. Wang et al. &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct adipose progenitor cells emerging with age drive active adipogenesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adipose tissue plays a crucial role in regulating various hormonal and metabolic processes and demonstrates substantial compositional and phenotypic plasticity. From middle age to early aging, adults often experience a notable increase in visceral adipose tissue mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visceral adiposity is believed to be an important risk factor for various metabolic disorders. The accumulation of adipose tissue occurs through two primary mechanisms: adipocyte hypertrophy and adipogenesis. However, the mechanisms by which early aging contributes to adipose tissue accumulation remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;RATIONALE&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adipogenesis is the process by which new adipocytes are generated through the proliferation and differentiation of adipose progenitor cells (APCs). Previous reports suggested that APCs exhibit a reduced capacity for adipogenesis in aged humans or rodents in an in vitro, two-dimensional (2D) culture setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this work, we used in vivo lineage tracing mouse models, 3D profiling of APC transplants to monitor adipogenesis of APCs up to middle age, and single-cell RNA sequencing to identify distinct types of APCs generated during this life stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functional assessments of these age-specific APCs provide insights into how adipogenesis contributes to visceral adipose tissue accumulation during middle age and early aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 12 months old, male mice gained body weight due to increased adipose tissue mass, especially in the visceral site. By contrast, female mice only had moderate body weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracking adipogenesis in lineage-tracing mouse models revealed that in contrast to the low turnover rate of adipocytes in young adults, more than 80% of adipocytes were newly generated in the visceral adipose tissue of 12-month-old male mice fed a standard chow diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with this massive adipogenesis, middle-aged mice developed adipocyte hypotrophy, visceral adiposity, reduced energy expenditure, and insulin resistance. 3D profiling of APC transplants quantitatively showed that APCs in middle-aged mice had a much higher adipogenic rate than those in young mice, indicating that these APCs cell-autonomously obtain higher adipogenic potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single-cell RNA sequencing of APCs then identified a new committed preadipocyte population that is age enriched (CP-A), both in mice and humans. CP-As displayed high proliferation and differentiation capacities, both in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of CP-As in the visceral adipose tissue increased when mice were 9 months old, peaked when they were 12 months old, and then sharply declined when they were 18 months old. Leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) was identified as a functional marker of CP-A. Pharmacological inhibition and genetic manipulations indicated that LIFR is indispensable for CP-A adipogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inhibition of LIFR did not affect the adipogenesis of young APCs, indicating that LIFR signaling is specifically required for CP-As. Lastly, chronic treatment with a LIFR inhibitor during early aging prevented the expansion of visceral fat in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrating in vivo lineage-tracing, 3D profiling of transplants, and single-cell RNA sequencing, our work reveals that adipogenesis of APCs contributes greatly to the visceral adipose tissue expansion during middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery of CP-A as an age-specific APC population, along with the validation of its high adipogenic capacity both in vitro and in vivo, and the identification of LIFR signaling as a CP-A–specific adipogenic mechanism enhance our understanding of the early aging process in fat tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key finding from our work is that despite the low turnover rate of adipocytes in young adults, adipogenesis is unlocked during middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase of adipogenic capacity in APCs distinguishes these cells from most other adult stem cells, which typically exhibit a reduced capacity to proliferate and differentiate with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, as the enhancement of adipogenesis and emergence of the CP-A population happens primarily in the male visceral adipose tissue and only during middle age and early aging, these events are location, stage, and sex specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings offer a fundamental understanding of the pathophysiology of age-related metabolic disorders, which may have critical implications for preventing and treating age-related diseases, thereby promoting healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;

Food anaphylaxis admissions to UK hospitals increased threefold from 1998 to 2018, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33597169/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according to one analysis&lt;/a&gt;, and the number of people affected by less severe allergies has also &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(24)00163-4/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;risen significantly&lt;/a&gt;, with factors including weaning practices, detergents and lack of childhood contact with dirt and animals all potential drivers of the trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Exposure as treatment is not a new idea: the first successful use of oral immunotherapy for a 13-year-old boy with egg allergy was &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11250212/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reported in The Lancet in 1908&lt;/a&gt;. But in the past decade, scientists have developed the incremental dosing protocols required to move this concept into the clinic. The licensing of the drug Palforzia – pharmaceutical-grade peanut protein – means the treatment can now be delivered to those whose allergies are extreme enough that a few milligrams too much peanut protein could trigger anaphylaxis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The treatment regimes are intensive, requiring fortnightly dosage escalations and a level of clinical supervision that has resulted in paediatric NHS waiting lists of several years. And, for most, they are not a cure – patients have an increased tolerance to low doses, but need to maintain daily exposure and are still considered allergic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The issue with eating a peanut every day is that you’re on a bit of a tightrope,” says Prof Graham Roberts, an allergy specialist at the University of Southampton. “You might still have a life-threatening allergic reaction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There is also a growing cohort of patients managing multiple allergies, for whom the approach is impractical. “That’s where the advantage of treatments that are completely agnostic to the food you’re allergic to comes in,” says Wood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Food allergies normally involve a class of potent antibodies, called IgEs, that bind to immune cells 1,000 times more tightly than other classes of antibody and which scientists think originally evolved to protect the body from parasites. Now, largely redundant in modern lifestyles, they have a weakness for misfiring in response to food proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2312382" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;landmark study last year&lt;/a&gt;, Wood and his colleagues found that the anti-IgE drug omalizumab, already licensed for severe asthma, could desensitise people to peanut, cashew, milk, egg, walnut, wheat and hazelnut allergies (participants were allergic to at least three) by mopping up the antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The treatment is “not without some burden”, Wood acknowledges, requiring ongoing fortnightly injections of a drug with an annual list price of between &lt;a href="https://www.xolair.com/cost.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$30,000 and $60,000&lt;/a&gt;. But it can be life-changing for those who need to avoid pervasive products such as milk, eggs and wheat. “Those families don’t travel without a cooler full of food,” Wood says. “They can’t eat out. They can’t trust anyone to prepare anything for their child. Your day-to-day life is massively compromised.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;New products in the pipeline could further lower the bar for treatment, including a &lt;a href="https://brandonbiocatalyst.com/2024/10/28/aravax-completes-recruitment-into-phase-2-study-of-pvx108-a-novel-immunotherapy-for-the-treatment-of-peanut-allergy/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;peanut allergy vaccine candidate&lt;/a&gt; being developed by the Australian biotech firm Aravax (the phase 2 trial still involved monthly injections) and a &lt;a href="https://www.anaphylaxis.org.uk/peanut-allergy-patch-shows-promising-long-term-results-in-3-year-study/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;peanut patch&lt;/a&gt; developed by the French company DBV that recently showed promising results in a three-year trial.

While immunotherapy does not reverse most food allergies, for bee stings it has a higher than 90% cure rate. Prof Markus Ollert, of the Luxembourg Institute of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;, tracked patients treated for bee sting allergies and revealed that a molecule called interleukin-6 appears to act as a switch in the transition from being allergic to tolerant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Others are focused on trying to prevent allergies arising in the first place. A primary culprit for the rise in allergies appears to have been misguided medical advice in the 1990s that parents should avoid giving babies foods such as peanuts in the first year of life. “Since then we’ve seen an absolute explosion in allergies,” says Roberts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In a randomised trial, he and colleagues found that introducing peanuts into the diet at four months led to an 80% reduction in allergies. Another, more recent study, found large reductions in peanut, egg, wheat and cows’ milk allergies when introduced to babies from three months of age. However, despite iron-clad evidence that early introduction is protective, it has proved difficult to undo warnings around the dangers of introducing peanuts too early and change parents’ behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxQVG1Vbkg2WTRSXzJxVzRSZFVCRWZhbEY0U05KN2JQRWh1V1E0dThrSEoyNGFDS2ZPX1FGV0d0YUJ6Z3BhTm9yeHFyeF9jN2tYa1p1cHJSQWV1ZzhmQUxjeXY0Q2kxTU9XR1llRllWVnlXdk9sSkZwV3Y2Rlp1bGtVRTNlcVppUF95ZUdzeHltN0tXUTVMYnNEY3ZoTVFqc19EYnJvakFmR0hxeG95dGNRSQ</guid></item><item><title>心脏病专家分享关键的心脏病发作体征以及何时寻求帮助- CNET | Cardiologists Share Key Heart Attack Signs and When to Call for Help - CNET</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPVFlhNGdiSnFlVXhZVjZuOGhCLTRIbDBJNU40UnlkVUJqa3pQOWlqdlBSR2RtZ01uV2xETUJhcEJjU01STExWZVNPeFlvX1VHU0VNcE8zWDlFWUgzY0dQSUZZSmtFME5IVmJlQXd1cXNCV216a05yQzJ3aEdxbnVSVy1rZk5tUDV5NG5zNlRCOGp4YnlZWTEzTnYxVnRONDJTaENiSzNKTEM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p1"&gt;If you or someone you know experiences a blockage of &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/your-blood-type-affects-your-heart-health-heres-how/" target="_self"&gt;blood flow &lt;/a&gt;to the point where the &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/what-causes-heart-disease-here-are-the-symptoms-and-things-to-look-out-for/" target="_self"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; is not getting enough oxygen, a heart attack may be occurring. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/heart-disease-awareness-when-why-screened-now/" target="_self"&gt;Heart&lt;/a&gt; attacks are medical emergencies that shouldn't be ignored and should be addressed as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;Chances of surviving a heart attack or saving a life depend on several factors, but what matters most is being able to identify when one is taking place and remembering five steps.

Call 911, no matter what &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you feel any of the above symptoms, even if you aren't sure it's a heart attack, you should call 911 immediately, doctors recommend.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you feel unwell, or you're starting to have chest discomfort, seek medical attention quickly, because the sooner you get treated, the better," says Dr. Grant Reed, an interventional cardiologist and director of Cleveland Clinic's STEMI program. "A lot of patients ignore their symptoms, and by the time they come in, their heart muscle has already died."   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Richard T. Nowitz/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The No. 1 indicator of how well you're going to do after a heart attack is how fast you recognize your symptoms, Reed adds. There's a strong relationship between when you start to have your heart attack (which is generally when symptoms start) and how fast doctors can open up the blocked coronary artery that's causing it -- the shorter the time, the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16750682/" target="_self"&gt;better the outcomes&lt;/a&gt;, not just regarding survival but also the likelihood of heart failure or needing to be readmitted to the hospital.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you get to the hospital, medical professionals will likely perform an electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG), which will determine the diagnosis of a heart attack. If it is a heart attack, you'll be taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where a coronary angiography will be performed. If you have a blockage in your coronary artery, the doctors will offer treatment with a balloon and a stent to keep the artery open.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people are hesitant to seek emergency medical care due to a lack of insurance or immigration status. In the US, hospitals are required to treat all people who come in with life-threatening emergencies.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a lot better to be treated and deal with the financial ramifications after the fact," Reed says. In most cases, costs can be sorted out with the hospital, he adds.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;jayk7/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; 2. Have an ambulance take you to the hospital   &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you suspect you're having a heart attack, don't drive yourself to the hospital: Call an ambulance. You could lose consciousness and hurt yourself or others on the road, says Dr. Joel Beachey, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic Health System in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. The same goes for having a loved one drive you -- if your symptoms worsen, they won't be able to help you while they're driving, and may be distracted.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paramedics can provide the best and fastest care while you're on the way to the hospital, including giving you an assessment and providing some treatment, Beachey says.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're with someone who is having heart attack symptoms and becomes unconscious, you should first call 911 and then engage in CPR, Breathett says. (You can find free CPR training at your local &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/" target="_self"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; branch and many other places.)   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; 3. Take aspirin, if you have it &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're having heart attack symptoms and have access to aspirin, take a full dose of 325 mg after calling the ambulance, Beachey says. (If you have baby aspirin, which comes in an 81 mg dose, take four of those.) He recommends chewing it instead of swallowing, so it gets into your system faster.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason? When you're having a heart attack, a plaque inside your arteries becomes unstable and ruptures, which forms a blood clot that can close off supply to that artery. Taking aspirin can help break down some of that blood clot.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;ER Productions Limited/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; 4. Advocate for yourself   &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, healthcare providers would take all patient concerns seriously when it comes to heart attack symptoms, but studies show women and people of color are less likely to receive adequate treatment for heart attacks and heart disease. For example, older Black women were 50% less likely to be treated when they arrived at a hospital with a heart attack or coronary artery disease symptoms than white women, including after accounting for education, income, insurance status and other heart health complications like diabetes and high blood pressure, a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/racial-disparities-continue-for-black-women-seeking-heart-health-care?preview=b3de" target="_self"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt; found.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been very clear over most of our history in the US that women and people of color are not heard," Breathett says. "Their symptoms get dismissed, and they have worse outcomes. As a health care system, we have a lot more work to do to change that system so that each person can get equitable care irrespective of their demographic."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until that time comes, patients need to be their own advocates and speak up for themselves, she adds. If they aren't being heard, they have the right to seek care elsewhere.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One tip recommended by a resident on TikTok: If you feel a provider isn't taking your symptoms seriously, for heart health or otherwise, you can ask the provider, "What is your differential diagnosis?"   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A differential diagnosis is a term to describe what the different diseases are that could be contributing to your symptoms, basically asking the provider to explain why they've ruled out a heart attack and what else it could be. "That might help a person realize, oh, I haven't effectively tested to make sure this is not cardiac disease," Breathett says.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also bring a family member or friend to help ask questions on your behalf. Write down questions in advance if you can, so you can have them addressed during your short visit. And call back with any questions that weren't answered. If you're not satisfied or feel that you're not being heard, seek out another care team.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; 5. Work on prevention  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You've heard it a million times, but that's because it's true: The &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/9-things-you-can-do-now-to-lower-your-risk-of-heart-disease/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;best way to prevent a heart attack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is by maintaining a healthy diet, doing moderate exercise for 120 to 150 minutes per week, keeping your cholesterol and blood pressure under control and not smoking.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Petar Chernaev/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart attacks can happen to people of any age, race or gender. You should get regular physical exams with your primary care provider to assess your risk and make lifestyle changes that can help with prevention. Some people might also benefit from taking a baby aspirin every day as a preventative measure, but you'll need to talk to your care provider about that.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is important even if you have a history of heart trouble, Beachey says.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing what to do to prevent and respond to a heart attack is just one of the many important elements of your health you should know about.

Researchers mapped connectivity patterns and found that disruptions in the frontoparietal network are key to both early and chronic psychosis symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using machine learning on brain imaging data, the team could predict positive and negative symptoms with stronger predictions in chronic cases. These findings may help identify biomarkers for earlier interventions and improve treatment strategies before symptoms worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Brain Network:&lt;/strong&gt; Disruptions in the frontoparietal network are linked to psychosis symptoms across stages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive Modeling:&lt;/strong&gt; Machine learning models accurately predicted symptom severity using brain connectivity patterns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Early identification of brain network disruptions could guide more effective, targeted interventions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Yale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patients in the early stages of psychosis respond to treatments differently than those who have developed a chronic version of the disorder. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the neurobiological changes from early to chronic stages is essential for developing targeted prevention and treatment strategies. But how symptoms change during this transition—and what role the brain plays—is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109180"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;While psychosis arises from a disruption across the whole brain, the team found the frontoparietal network played a critical role in both early and chronic psychosis. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Yale School of Medicine (YSM) have now examined patients with early and chronic forms of psychosis to map symptom evolution and identify relevant brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They published their findings in the journal &lt;em&gt;Neuropsychopharmacology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are interested in how psychosis and psychiatric disorders develop,” says Maya Foster, first author of the study and a PhD student in the lab of Dustin Scheinost, PhD, associate professor of radiology and biomedical imaging at YSM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With this study, we looked at the underlying brain networks—regions that are functionally connected and work in coordination—to link brain areas to symptoms in patients with either early or chronic psychosis, and we assessed the similarities and differences between these networks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Treating psychosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cause of psychosis symptoms are not well understood but are broadly believed to result from disrupted or altered brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are known as “positive” symptoms of psychosis—in that they are added experiences healthy individuals don’t usually encounter—include hallucinations and delusions, while negative symptoms—or deficient versions of healthy experiences—include memory impairment, disorganized thinking, lack of motivation, and an inability to feel pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with psychosis often experience negative symptoms first. As their psychosis worsens, positive symptoms emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite their shared symptom experiences, early and chronic cases respond to treatment differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studies show that patients have better prognoses if they get treatment early,” says Foster. “Chronic psychosis has higher incidences of relapse, and available treatments do not work as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies suggest that early interventions reduce psychosis symptoms, but longitudinal studies that follow patients through the transition from early to chronic condition have not yet been done. Filling in this information gap could help clinicians more effectively treat patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To begin to address this gap, Foster and Scheinost examined two large-scale open source datasets to identify how symptoms evolve in patients with early or chronic psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Human Connectome Project Early Psychosis (HCP-EP) dataset contains information for early psychosis patients who present with symptoms within five years of data collection. The Strategic Research Program for Brain Sciences (SRPBS) Multi-disorder Connectivity dataset consists of patients with varying levels of symptom severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HCP-EP dataset contained information for 107 participants, which was compared with data from 57 healthy participants. The SRPBS dataset contained information for 123 participants, which was compared with that of 99 healthy participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Mapping brain networks to psychosis symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify connectivity patterns in the brain that underpin psychosis symptoms, the team trained a machine learning model on functional magnetic resonance imaging data and symptom information collected from individuals with early or chronic psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found the model was able to predict positive and negative symptoms in both groups. The predictions for the chronic psychosis population were stronger, likely because of greater symptom burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While psychosis arises from a disruption across the whole brain, the team found the frontoparietal network played a critical role in both early and chronic psychosis. This region of the brain is involved in cognitive flexibility, cognitive control, and coordinating behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Foster, negative symptoms may be linked to disruptions in the frontoparietal network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings provide a neurobiological reference point that could allow clinicians to track symptom-based brain networks as patients transition from early to chronic psychosis, say the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we can characterize brain differences to better understand symptoms, then we could potentially identify targets or biomarkers,” says Scheinost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With more work, we might be able to predict transition points to monitor as you go along in treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could track patients over time to uncover how the identified brain networks change throughout the lifespan of psychosis. This approach could inform treatment options to improve care and prevent worsening of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foster and Scheinost collaborated with psychiatrist Albert Powers, PhD, associate professor of psychiatry at YSM and co-author of the study, to contextualize their findings.

P&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;rediction effect sizes were higher in CP, and prediction of general psychopathology and total symptoms was only possible in CP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtual lesioning analyses revealed the frontoparietal network as a critical component of EP and CP symptom networks. Predictive models were broadly similar between EP and CP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also generalized the EP positive score model to CP positive symptoms and identified group differences between CP and matched HCs more robustly than EP. Overall, broadly similar networks were found in CP and EP, but larger effects were observed in CP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings provide a foundation for longitudinal studies to track connectivity changes in symptom networks throughout the psychosis lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar stage-comparative approaches can enhance understanding of the etiology of early and chronic psychosis symptoms for therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 12:59:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTFByODhfeGNUUGtMQkVsMHZyc05FX1FpQkdzMXhPX0k2UGhQWjhjN1ktOGRONlluQ0FWVm85aF9DVHRoMVp4RkJHazZRRTdZNnpnS1NnX1ZkSklBcURJREhaYktrQ1JjU3BKUGdYNmpEMG1uQUg2QlYwRml3</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现呼吸与视觉之间的关键联系- AOL.com | Scientists discover a critical link between breathing and vision - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQVDluTmU2Uy1uYkRubGwzR1J3Y2VwTUpxbnFqTEdpdS12anl0d21Ya25VVjlHN0IyLTBkdm85bWdxMEszSUJUaTM1WG9LODNnQkRySWNMNDB2bzJQT1dPOXgtTUg0MnhpeDlpU2h2ZVhwN3dxOEd0UlFkZTlWOU9wWFREeDR6UTFO?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;New research reveals that the way you breathe can change the size of your pupils, subtly shaping how you see the world.

Researchers from &lt;a href="https://ki.se/en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Karolinska Institutet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Karolinska Institutet&lt;/a&gt; in Sweden have found that the simple act of breathing subtly shapes how our pupils behave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;a href="https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1113/JP287205" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Journal of Physiology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Journal of Physiology&lt;/a&gt;, reveals a striking pattern: pupils shrink during inhalation and expand during exhalation. This rhythmic shift points to a basic biological process that might influence not only vision but also how we experience the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much like a camera’s aperture, the pupil adjusts the amount of light reaching the eye. When it narrows or widens, it changes the way we see—sharpening fine details or making faint objects easier to spot. Now, with breathing added to the equation, it appears our vision quietly fluctuates throughout every breath we take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Abstract figure. Across five experiments including 203 participants and a wide range of experimental conditions researchers demonstrate that pupil size fluctuates in a systematic manner over the course of the breathing cycle. (CREDIT: The Journal of Physiology)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This mechanism is unique in that it is cyclical, ever-present, and requires no external stimulus,” says Artin Arshamian, associate professor at the Department of Clinical Neuroscience at Karolinska Institutet. “Since breathing affects brain activity and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/humans-may-actually-have-a-one-track-mind-after-all-study-finds/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cognitive functions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cognitive functions&lt;/a&gt;, the discovery may contribute to a better understanding of how our vision and attention are regulated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Brain, Breathing and Visual Focus&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings build on a growing body of research showing that breathing does more than supply oxygen. It also generates rhythmic electrical patterns, known as neural oscillations, that sweep across the brain and shape how we think and perceive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These oscillations are born deep within the brainstem, in a cluster of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/mit-scientists-identify-the-effects-of-huntington-s-disease-on-neurons/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neurons;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;neurons&lt;/a&gt; called the preBötzinger complex, which controls breathing rhythms. They also emerge in the olfactory bulb, triggered when air moves through the nose, linking breath directly to brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal studies have shown that breathing-related brain rhythms help synchronize sensory and motor behaviors such as sniffing, whisking, and head movements. Likewise, the control of pupil size plays a critical role in processing visual information, adjusting how much the brain can detect and respond to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, though, clear proof connecting breathing to pupil changes had been missing. Earlier studies struggled with small sample sizes and inconsistent methods, leaving the link between &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/exercise-bottle-drug-helps-body-115700505.html" data-ylk="slk:respiration;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;respiration&lt;/a&gt; and vision largely unexplored—until this discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To clarify this connection, the research team conducted five carefully controlled experiments with over 200 participants. Their findings confirmed that breathing consistently influenced pupil size across various conditions, whether participants were breathing quickly or slowly, through the nose or mouth, in bright or dim lighting, at rest, or engaged in visual tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most striking results was that the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/lifechanging-new-eye-drops-can-make-reading-glasses-obsolete/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pupil fluctuations;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pupil fluctuations&lt;/a&gt; occurred even in individuals born without an olfactory bulb, a brain structure typically associated with nasal breathing. This suggests that the brainstem alone may regulate the effect, highlighting its deep evolutionary roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Polar plots of participants’ pupil sizes over the course of the breathing cycle. 0° (Inh) marks the onset of inhalation, 90° marks peak inhalation, 180° (Exh) marks the onset of exhalation, and 270° marks peak exhalation. (CREDIT: The Journal of Physiology)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How Pupil Changes May Shape Perception&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study raises intriguing possibilities about how vision shifts in response to breathing. Pupil size directly affects how light enters the eye, influencing visual acuity. A smaller pupil, like a camera lens set to a narrow aperture, enhances sharpness and depth of field, making it easier to see fine details. A larger pupil, by contrast, allows more light to enter, improving sensitivity to dim or distant objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that our vision may switch between optimizing for distinguishing small details when we inhale and detecting faint objects when we exhale, all within a single breathing cycle,” says Martin Schaefer, a postdoctoral researcher at Karolinska Institutet and the study’s first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this effect is strong enough to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/drawings-from-children-reveal-their-perceptions-and-experiences-of-the-covid-pandemic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:impact perception;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;impact perception&lt;/a&gt;, it could have significant implications for daily activities. Tasks requiring high visual precision, such as reading or threading a needle, might be easier when inhaling. Meanwhile, scanning for movement in low light, such as spotting a shadow at night, might be enhanced during exhalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Pupil size in participants with and without olfactory bulbs. (CREDIT: The Journal of Physiology)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Potential Applications in Medicine and Neuroscience&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond its effects on vision, the link between respiration and pupil size may have medical applications. The autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary bodily functions, regulates both breathing and pupil response. Abnormalities in this system can signal neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One potential application is new methods to diagnose or treat neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease, where damage to pupil function is an early sign of the disease,” says Arshamian. “This is something we want to explore in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pupil measurements are already used in clinical settings to assess brain function, detect &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/the-remarkable-success-of-new-brain-injury-implant-patients-choose-to-keep-them-on/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain injuries;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;brain injuries&lt;/a&gt;, and monitor states of consciousness. If respiration-induced pupil changes serve as an additional diagnostic marker, they could offer a new, non-invasive way to detect early signs of neurological disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Pupil size during paced breathing. (CREDIT: The Journal of Physiology)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will determine how this discovery might be applied in medical diagnostics and whether breathing techniques could be used to modulate attention and perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While much remains to be explored, this study offers a new perspective on how breath, brain, and vision are interconnected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: Materials provided above by &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Brighter Side of News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Brighter Side of News&lt;/a&gt;.

In the study, daily light and sound exposure boosted performance in memory tasks and promoted gene activity linked to synaptic development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also found higher expression of genes protecting against aging and Alzheimer’s-like degeneration. While promising, further studies are needed to confirm whether similar benefits occur in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Improvement:&lt;/strong&gt; 40Hz sensory stimulation enhanced short-term memory performance in Down syndrome mouse models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurogenesis Boost:&lt;/strong&gt; Stimulated mice showed increased new neuron growth and synaptic connectivity in the hippocampus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Stimulation helped preserve neurons linked to cognitive resilience against Alzheimer’s pathology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Picower Institute at MIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Studies by a growing number of labs have identified neurological health benefits from exposing human volunteers or animal models to light, sound and/or tactile stimulation at the brain’s “gamma” frequency rhythm of 40Hz. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the latest such research at The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and Alana Down Syndrome Center at MIT, scientists found that 40Hz sensory stimulation improved cognition and circuit connectivity and encouraged the growth of new neurons in mice genetically engineered to model Down syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109172"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;About 90 percent of people with Down syndrome develop Alzheimer’s disease, typically after the age of 40.

They found that in a critical subregion, the dentate gyrus, stimulated mice had significantly more synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diving deeper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team not only examined gene expression across individual cells, but also analyzed that data to assess whether there were patterns of coordination across multiple genes. Indeed they found several such “modules” of co-expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of this evidence further substantiated the idea that 40Hz-stimulated mice made important improvements in synaptic connectivity, but another key finding highlighted a role for TCF4, a key regulator of gene transcription needed for generating new neurons, or “neurogenesis.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s analysis of genetic data suggested that TCF4 is underexpressed in Down syndrome mice but the researchers saw improved TCF4 expression in GENUS-stimulated mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers went to the lab bench to determine whether the mice also exhibited a difference in neurogenesis, they found direct evidence that stimulated mice exhibited more than unstimulated mice in the dentate gyrus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These increases in TCF4 expression and neurogenesis are only correlational, the researchers noted, but they hypothesize that the increase in new neurons likely helps explain at least some of the increase in new synapses and improved short term memory function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The increased putative functional synapses in the dentate gyrus is likely related to the increased adult neurogenesis observed in the Down syndrome mice following GENUS treatment,” Islam said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is the first to document that GENUS is associated with increased neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis of gene expression modules also yielded other key insights. One is that a cluster of genes whose expression typically declines with normal aging and in Alzheimer’s disease, remained at higher expression levels among mice who received 40Hz sensory stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the researchers also found evidence that mice that received stimulation retained more cells in the hippocampus that express Reelin. Reelin-expressing neurons are especially vulnerable in Alzheimer’s disease, but expression of the protein is associated with cognitive resilience amid Alzheimer’s disease pathology, which Ts65Dn mice develop. About 90 percent of people with Down syndrome develop Alzheimer’s disease, typically after the age of 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this study, we found that GENUS enhances the percentage of Reln+ neurons in hippocampus of a mouse model of Down syndrome, suggesting that GENUS may promote cognitive resilience,” Islam said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together with other studies, Tsai and Islam said, the new results add evidence that GENUS helps to stimulate the brain at the cellular and molecular level to mount a homeostatic response to aberrations caused by disease pathology, be it neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s, demyelination in chemo brain, or deficits of neurogenesis in Down syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the authors also cautioned that the study had limits. Not only is the Ts65Dn model an imperfect reflection of human Down syndrome, but also the mice used were all male. Moreover, the cognitive tests in the study only measured short-term memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally, while the study was novel for extensively examining gene expression in the hippocampus amid GENUS stimulation, it did not look at changes in other cognitively critical brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Jackson, Islam and Tsai, the paper’s other authors are Maeesha Tasnim Naomi, Brooke Schatz, Noah Tan, Mitchell Murdock, Dong Shin Park, Daniela Rodrigues Amorim, Fred Jiang, S.

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A statistical analysis has found associations between exposure to air pollution and declining cognitive performance.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Air pollution includes exposure to airborne substances such as nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cutting air pollution could have several &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/health/t-47500765"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British studies have shed light on the health consequences of exposure to air pollution and the benefits of reducing airborne toxins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/majority-of-the-world-has-polluted-air-report/a-71884331"&gt;Air pollution is a global problem&lt;/a&gt; that has been shown to cause a range of health and environmental issues and is linked to increased rates of cancer, as well as heart, lung and reproductive problems. Research has &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/air-pollution-linked-to-15-million-deaths-per-year-study/a-70904590"&gt;connected it to 1.5 million deaths&lt;/a&gt; annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contaminated air can also exacerbate existing health issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, an inquest listed air pollution &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/coroner-traces-london-girls-asthma-death-to-air-pollution/a-55976433"&gt;as the cause of death for a 9-year-old girl&lt;/a&gt; with asthma in Southeast London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/pollution/t-19225773"&gt;Pollutants&lt;/a&gt; may also drive declining &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/human-brain/t-66434775"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One recently published &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article/80/5/glaf060/8082041" title="External link — study"&gt;study&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt; led by researchers from University College London has found a link between exposure to two common pollutants and below-average cognition among older Britons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among these toxins is nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a gas released by petrol-powered vehicles, industrial processes and fossil fuel burning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other is fine particulate matter — also known as PM2.5 — a cover-all term used to describe many substances released by burning processes that are less than 2.5 micrometers wide, about the size of many bacterial cells such as &lt;em&gt;E.coli&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When controlling for geographic location and socioeconomic factors, the researchers found that the amount of ambient air pollution where a person lives is associated with lower levels of overall and executive brain function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though associations such as these do not strictly mean that higher air pollution causes lower brain function, the researchers are confident it would be proved by a more in-depth study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their confidence draws from the large dataset used for the research, known as the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, which consists of almost a quarter century of data on people older than 50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We looked at the ongoing exposure, and we also knew the levels of cognitive function before. So we cannot be certain, but we're pretty confident that there is not just an association [between exposure and cognition]," said Paola Zaninotto, a medical and social statistician at UCL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="64010258" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/64010258_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="Fumes emerge from chimneys at a Welsh liquefied natural gas terminal. "&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;Nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter result from burning fossil fuels, including in transport, industry and energy generation.&lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: K. Fitzmaurice-Brown/blickwinkel/picture alliance&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Early study to shine light on brain impact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zaninotto said the study was simply a first step toward finding a more definitive cause and effect. However, her multidisciplinary research group has drawn some initial conclusions from the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cognitive decline could result from pollutants in the bloodstream affecting the areas of the temporal lobe, the section of the brain that processes sensory information, language, memory and emotions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research by other UCL medical specialists also found that NO2 and particulates hurt the functioning of the central nervous and circulatory systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The exposure really is contributing to increase the cognitive decline and that in time will lead to dementia, so we really need to start thinking about reversing this trend," Zaninotto said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not an easy trend to reverse. Even those with the lowest exposures to ambient pollution were still subject to levels above limits recommended by &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/who-air-pollution-causes-7-million-premature-deaths-a-year/a-59264198"&gt;World Health Organization guidelines.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These set a limit of 5 micrograms per cubic meter. The minimum exposure in the English cohort was eight and though reductions have been observed since the start of the study in 2010, some groups were exposed to levels nearly three times the recommendation as recently as 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There are improvements, but, despite these improvements, I think we are really still a long way from protecting people's brain health," Zaninotto said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="66657154" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/66657154_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt='A street sign in London reads: "Transport for London Ultra low emission (ULEZ) Zone"'&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;London's clean air zones were found to save 37 million pounds annually in productivity costs&lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: Yui Mok/empics/picture alliance&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;London transport measures show a way forward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If transport pollution is a major source of ambient air pollution, some policy measures may show a path to at least easing the concentration of contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2025.106994" title="External link — An analysis"&gt;An analysis&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by a pair of UK-based economists found that policies introduced in London to create "low emission zones" have been effective at cutting pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result has been an improvement in several health-related economic factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low (LEZ) and &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/london-expands-ulez-toll-zone-for-polluting-vehicles/a-66656932"&gt;Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ)&lt;/a&gt; policies introduced for central London in the past two decades were credited with reducing NO2 levels by 21%, while coarse particulates were cut by 15%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This led to improvements in the number of Londoners taking sick leave, and a 10% cut to respiratory problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ULEZ is one of the strictest emission regulations in the world, but other nations, including several in Europe, as well as major Asian capitals such as Beijing, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Hanoi, have introduced similar controls on vehicle emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though vehicles aren't the only sources of air pollution, they are major drivers close to where people live and work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Study co-author Eleonora Fichera, an applied economist at the UK's University of Bath, said the connection between health outcomes and economic benefits wasn't surprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"But the size of the effect is quite striking," Fichera said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, Fichera's study attributed £37 million (€43.4 million) in annual savings to the combined benefits of the policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"[Low emissions zones] are a very quick way to bring down pollution and it has short-term effects and long-term effects," Fichera said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We find reductions in particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide translate into productivity improvements, well-being and the mechanisms potentially [lead to] improvements in physical health," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Trending weight loss drugs &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-vs-wegovy-the-risks-and-side-effects-of-semaglutide-drugs"&gt;such as Ozempic and Wegovy&lt;/a&gt; may be highly effective at tackling obesity, but are they also carrying some darker side effects in the long run? A new study shows these medications could trigger brain changes linked to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="158963" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ozempic and Wegovy are both what's known as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 drugs), so named because they mimic the natural GLP-1 hormone found in the brain, gut, and pancreas. It helps to control blood sugar and appetite, just like the natural hormone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also know these GLP-1 drugs influence parts of the brain rich in dopamine, a key chemical in feelings of pleasure and reward, and are already being looked at as ways of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2024.107312"&gt;treating alcohol and drug addiction,&lt;/a&gt; in addition to obesity and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="158963" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_158966" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-158966" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BrainMap-1.jpg" alt="Brain map" class="wp-image-158966 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BrainMap-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BrainMap-1-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-158966" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at how different messaging pathways in the brain might interact. (Sharafshah et al., &lt;em&gt;Curr. Neuropharmacol.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this newly published paper, an international team of researchers has connected the dopamine disruption driven by GLP-1 drugs to potential depression and suicide ideation in people genetically disposed to hypodopaminergia – low dopamine function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The paper provides critical evidence for re-evaluating the widespread use of GLP-1 drugs," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1080906"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; psychiatrist Mark Gold of the Washington University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The FDA and other regulatory agencies should carefully consider our findings when it comes to labeling and monitoring these drugs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get ahead of ourselves, we should note that this study relies on computer modeling: there were no lab tests or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="158963" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; done here. Instead, the researchers ran an analysis of GLP-1 drug genetic pathways linked to depression and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/premenstrual-disorders-linked-with-increased-risk-of-just-one-tragic-cause-of-death"&gt;suicide risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found interaction with the activity of certain genes – including DRD3, BDNF, CREB1, CRH, IL6, and DPP4. These genes check two boxes: they're associated with dopamine signaling and mood, and GLP-1 drugs could influence their behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't the first time this connection has been made, either. The European Medicines Agency is &lt;a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ema-statement-ongoing-review-glp-1-receptor-agonists"&gt;already investigating&lt;/a&gt; how people taking GLP-1 drugs may have increased thoughts of suicide and self-harm, based on reports from health professionals in Iceland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2024, a review of side effects from GLP-1 drugs found that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/rare-psychiatric-events-linked-to-ozempic-have-experts-concerned"&gt;1.2 percent were adverse psychiatric events&lt;/a&gt;, with depression the most commonly reported, followed by anxiety and suicidal ideation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research is still at its earliest stages, so we shouldn't jump to any conclusions yet, but given how different we all are in our genetics, our environments, and our reactions to drugs, it's crucial to find out as much as possible about &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/are-weight-loss-drugs-like-ozempic-for-you-consider-these-risks-and-benefits"&gt;potential GLP-1 drug side effects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These treatments are still relatively new, and with each piece of research we're understanding more about how their chronic use may impact our health in the long run, whether that's how they can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weight-loss-drugs-like-ozempic-could-have-a-surprising-effect-on-drinking-habits"&gt;cut down on cravings&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-could-be-good-for-your-heart-even-if-you-dont-lose-weight"&gt;offer cardiovascular health benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While GLP1-R drugs hold promise for treating addictive and behavioral disorders, we must remain vigilant about their potential harm," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1080906"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; psychiatrist Igor Elman of Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This study is not intended to break the bubble of hope but to add a layer of precaution in their over-prescription."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2174/011570159X349579241231080602"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current Neuropharmacology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If this story has raised concerns or you need to talk to someone, &lt;a href="http://www.suicidestop.com/call_a_hotline.html"&gt;please consult this list to find a 24/7 crisis hotline in your country, and reach out for help.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Some strains of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neisseria_gonorrhoeae"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the bacteria that causes the sexually transmitted infection (STI) &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonorrhea"&gt;gonorrhea&lt;/a&gt;, have evolved to be resistant to most modern drugs. However, we may now have a new class of antibiotic to use as a weapon against the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the team, led by researchers from the University of Konstanz in Germany and the University of Vienna in Austria, what makes the newly identified compound so effective is that it launches a self-destruct sequence inside &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt; (also known as gonococci).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers started by looking at a group of alkyl quinolones (AQs), substances that some bacteria use to help trigger attack and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus-that-murders-sleeping-bacteria-could-be-used-to-assassinate-superbugs"&gt;defense mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; against other bacteria. As well as analyzing these AQs, the team synthesized new variations in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_158805" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-158805" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BacteriaAttack.jpg" alt="Bacteria attack" class="wp-image-158805 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BacteriaAttack.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BacteriaAttack-600x309.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-158805" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Compounds from another bacteria proved effective against &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt;. (Mix et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Microbiology&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of these new AQ molecules actually did have a unique effect," &lt;a href="https://www.uni-konstanz.de/en/university/news-and-media/current-announcements/news-in-detail/new-antibiotic-for-multidrug-resistant-superbug/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; cell biologist Christof Hauck, from the University of Konstanz. "The chemical compound was able to kill gonococci without having a negative impact on other microorganisms or human cells."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That chemical compound was 2-nonyl-4-quinolone N-oxide or NQNO, which is taken from the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; bacteria. In experiments, it was shown to block the growth of &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt;, stopping the bug in its tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, NQNO stops the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_transport_chain"&gt;electron transport chain&lt;/a&gt; inside gonococci, an essential part of the energy production process in cells. That then leads to increased stress on the bacteria, which causes one of its own toxins to appear and kill itself off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even better, tests run by the researchers show that the compound doesn't harm some other, beneficial bacteria that can be found in the body. In mice models, the NQNO treatment was shown to be effective against gonorrhea, and the researchers were also able to create a more potent and effective version of it with some chemical engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"From other microorganisms, we know about such self-destruction programs based on toxin-antitoxin systems, and our AQ substance seems to precisely target this Achilles heel of gonococci," &lt;a href="https://www.uni-konstanz.de/en/university/news-and-media/current-announcements/news-in-detail/new-antibiotic-for-multidrug-resistant-superbug/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; microbiologist Ann-Kathrin Mix, from the University of Konstanz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt; is infamous enough that it's found a place on the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240093461"&gt;Bacterial Priority Pathogens List&lt;/a&gt; put together by the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-does-the-world-health-organisation-do" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73079" data-postid="158802" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO), a 15-strong rogues gallery of the most dangerous superbugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the challenge in combating it is that it has a special superpower: being able to pick and choose genetic material from other microbes that the bacteria comes into contact with, including genes that promote &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-third-leading-cause-of-death-globally-in-2019-was-antibiotic-resistant-bacterial-infection"&gt;antibiotic resistance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work continues to combat gonorrhea and the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/gonorrhoea-(neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection)"&gt;tens of millions&lt;/a&gt; of infections it causes globally every year, and while it's still early days for this new treatment possibility, it could help us stay ahead of the rapidly evolving defenses of &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Gonococci are notorious for quickly becoming resistant to antibiotics," &lt;a href="https://www.uni-konstanz.de/en/university/news-and-media/current-announcements/news-in-detail/new-antibiotic-for-multidrug-resistant-superbug/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; microbial biochemist Thomas Böttcher, from the University of Vienna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is one of the reasons why gonococcal strains have recently emerged that are resistant to all antibiotics currently in use – such superbugs can no longer be treated with antibiotics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-025-01968-y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Microbiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Michael Wolff spent 18 months undergoing intensive treatment for follicular lymphoma, a slow-growing blood cancer. Despite the strict regimen, he was only getting sicker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolff's oncologist didn't understand it and sent the then 54-year-old to Dr. Mrinal Gounder at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Wolff underwent another biopsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test found that Wolff had an extremely rare, aggressive blood cancer called histiocytic sarcoma. Only about 300 patients are diagnosed with the condition each year in the U.S. Gounder, an oncologist who focuses on treating sarcomas, said the lymphoma that Wolff was being treated for earlier may have led to the development of the riskier cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolff said that Gounder told him he had only treated about 10 cases of the disease before. Wolff didn't want to ask what had happened to those patients. Soon, he was given his prognosis: Gounder estimated Wolff had two months to live. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was 10 years ago. Now, Wolff is considered cured after technology that he said "seemed like science fiction" was used to find an effective treatment for the rare cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using genetic sequencing to find treatment options  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/cancer-breakthrough-genetic-sequencing-could-change-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Genetic sequencing&lt;/a&gt; is a process where the DNA that makes up a cancer tumor is analyzed for unique genetic mutations. Those changes can point researchers in the direction of possible treatments, said Dr. Shridar Ganesan, the director of NYU Langone's molecular oncology program and a physician–scientist who was not involved in Wolff's care.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For a long while, the classification of cancer was kind of dominated by anatomy, by where the lump is, and how it looks like under the microscope," Ganesan said. "But we realize now that in addition to kind of rise and lumps, we have to also take into account the exact changes that make the cancer cells different than normal cells, because that, in many ways, is the clue to both telling us why these cells are misbehaving, and can give us insights into how to then specifically target the growth of these abnormal cells." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolff was at the "edge of a cliff," Gounder said. So he put Wolff on another course of intensive chemotherapy, then began analyzing the sarcoma. The process took about six weeks. Wolff said the chemotherapy left him unable to sleep and beset with high fevers. Gounder said the treatment didn't do much to help. But by the time the chemotherapy course was complete, the genetic sequencing results had come back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed "six or seven potential roads" that could have been used for treatment, Gounder said. He and others at Memorial Sloan Kettering looked at all the options, then settled on a pill called Mekinist, which is most often used to treat melanomas. Gounder believed a mutation found in Wolff's cancer made the pill a good option. There had never been a case where the drug had been used to treat histiocytic sarcoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When he said 'I think I found something and I think we have a drug that can (treat you),' I said 'Well, what's the research?'" Wolff remembered. "He said 'You're the research.'" &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;"I'm just so thankful" &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolff began taking the new regimen. He was skeptical that a medication that "looked like a little sugar pill" could help him when chemotherapy had failed. Within two days, the chemotherapy side effects he was experiencing were gone. Ten days into the treatment, Gounder did a PET scan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exam found an 80% reduction in Wolff's tumors. Wolff said he considered the results "a miracle." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was totally blown away that this thing could have any effect," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gounder said Wolff's improvement was a welcome surprise — and helped change the game for future patients. In 2018, he &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6062005/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;published Wolff's case&lt;/a&gt; in the New England Journal of Medicine. Mekenist is now used to treat histiocytic sarcomas, and in 2022, the Food and Drug Administration also approved the use of another medication, Cotellic. The outcomes for patients are "night and day," Gounder said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Wolff's cancer has not returned, 10 years after he was given just months to live. He was able to stop taking the medication, and last summer, Gounder told him he didn't need to return for annual checkups. He still sees a hematologist, an interventional radiologist and a dermatologist to treat side effects from the chemotherapy courses, but he's been able to return to his career as a renowned jazz musician. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've been able to record so much music and play so many concerts around the world," Wolff said. "Every time I do something like that, I'm just so thankful to be able to do it." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next for genetic sequencing? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolff's case was 10 years ago, when genetic sequencing of cancers was in the early stages. Now, scientists can analyze a tumor's whole genome in a matter of days, Gounder said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ganesan said the technology is being used more widely now, particularly in patients with advanced-stage cancers. In some cases, like Wolff's, doctors find a new use for an existing drug. In others, knowing the specific makeup of a cancer allows doctors to develop new treatment options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As genetic sequencing is used more widely, scientists are also learning more about the "enormous diversity of cancers," Ganesan said. He hopes that eventually, many cancers can be treated or cured using options discovered by genetic sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Two people with the same organ-based cancer diagnosis may have very different diseases. This is giving us a chance to understand that, and also to understand the very specific treatments," Ganesan said. "In the old days, we used to give a therapy and say 'Oh, 30% respond, I wonder why?' Now, it starts to tease apart why patients respond to some therapies and not to others, and also define, build and craft specific treatments for individual patients."&lt;/p&gt;

They have the type of twin closeness I thought only existed in fiction—lots of time together, shared interests, communicating so much with only eye contact, and living in opposite halves of a duplex together. Adam is straight but his brother, “Kyle,” is gay. Because they’re so close, I also spend enormous amounts of time with Kyle and his boyfriend, “Nick.” I’m lucky that I really enjoy Kyle and Nick because it is a lot like I acquired another sibling and a close friend, as soon as I got serious with my boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

She asked me point blank in person once, and when I denied it she left an accusing note on my car! I mentioned this as a weird experience to a friend, and she told me that there is absolutely gossip going around town about one or both of us being unfaithful because of the optics of the time spent together. I’m 32, we’re not in high school! Both Nick and I moved to this medium-sized commuter town about a year ago and met our boyfriends at that point, so we don’t know a lot of people here. I’m kind of at a loss about what to do. Do I just ignore it? My boyfriend advocates for this, but it feels weird. Go places as a group of four and hope it fades? I feel like I’m living out a bad sitcom.&lt;/p&gt;

I agree with your boyfriend that your best bet is to ignore what your friend told you about the rumors, and when it comes to in-person confrontations like the one you had with your neighbor, you can just say “you’re welcome.” If she asks what you’re talking about you can say “The story you made up about me is obviously captivating to you, and you didn’t even have to subscribe to a streaming service and watch reality TV to get it.”&lt;/p&gt;

She recently took on a great deal of extra work and stress when my sister suffered a stroke that left her severely physically disabled. As my sister, a successful physician before her stroke, has spent more time with my mom, she has become increasingly worried about my mom’s memory. Alzheimer’s sadly runs in our family and is something that my mother fears deeply. My sister wants me to speak to our mom about this, but I worry about adding to her stress/fear at an already unbearably hard time in her life. My sister struggles with speech, so it would be hard for her to have this conversation herself. Would it be appropriate to bring this up to my mom’s PCP (a close family friend, in addition to an excellent doctor)? I wonder if it would be easier on my mom if her PCP brought this up at her next appointment as something more routine, instead of something we have noticed lately. I guess, in general: When is it time for kids to start taking a more active role in parents’ health, and is it ever ok for us to speak directly to their healthcare professionals?&lt;/p&gt;

I really think our culture needs something similar to mark older adults’ transition into the stage of life in which other people will begin to handle stuff for them—a big party that celebrates the life they’ve lived so far and comes with an understanding that the moment has come for loved ones to take a bigger role in supporting them, helping with daily life, and managing healthcare decisions. Similar to how a bride and groom sign a marriage certificate at the reception, the guest of honor could sit at a nicely decorated table to finalize their power of attorney and healthcare proxy paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9x9v51200333575ognipz4n@published"&gt;In the absence of one clear moment in which responsibility shifts, the question you asked, “When is it time for kids to start taking an active role in parents’ health?” is always a really touchy and fraught one. No one wants to offend an older adult by treating them as if they’re incompetent! But also, no one wants a loved one to suffer because they are in fact less up to the task of managing their own health than they once were. And it all happens under a cloud of anxiety about death, so conversations about this are even harder to think about and tempting to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9x9v51300343575zetwowdf@published"&gt;Your mom is on the young side for any of these issues, but the family history of Alzheimer’s makes your concerns very real. I assume she’s spoken openly about her fears about memory issues. One approach could be to say, “Mom, I know you’ve always been worried about Alzheimer’s because of what [x relative] went through. There are some good medications these days, so let’s talk to your doctor about whether some of the forgetfulness you’ve been dealing with is just normal aging, or whether it’s something we can start treating as soon as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

She told us that her husband of 30 years is a narcissist and has been cheating on her since day one of her marriage. We have known for years that he is an alcoholic, and he is a lovable guy that my husband gets along well with. She tells us he sleeps with other women and other men, and that he tracks her car, her messages, everything. She says he’s taken out multiple mortgages on the house without her knowledge and all the finances are kept secret. She has no evidence to back any of this up and all she wants is to be believed and be heard. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/11/friend-terrible-marriage-dear-prudence-advice.html"&gt;Against my better judgment, I’m asked to believe her. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But a new discovery adds breathing to that list. Researchers from &lt;a href="https://ki.se/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Karolinska Institutet&lt;/a&gt; in Sweden have found that the simple act of breathing subtly shapes how our pupils behave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;a href="https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1113/JP287205" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Journal of Physiology&lt;/a&gt;, reveals a striking pattern: pupils shrink during inhalation and expand during exhalation. This rhythmic shift points to a basic biological process that might influence not only vision but also how we experience the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much like a camera’s aperture, the pupil adjusts the amount of light reaching the eye. When it narrows or widens, it changes the way we see—sharpening fine details or making faint objects easier to spot. Now, with breathing added to the equation, it appears our vision quietly fluctuates throughout every breath we take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Abstract figure.

It also generates rhythmic electrical patterns, known as neural oscillations, that sweep across the brain and shape how we think and perceive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These oscillations are born deep within the brainstem, in a cluster of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/mit-scientists-identify-the-effects-of-huntington-s-disease-on-neurons/"&gt;neurons&lt;/a&gt; called the preBötzinger complex, which controls breathing rhythms. They also emerge in the olfactory bulb, triggered when air moves through the nose, linking breath directly to brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal studies have shown that breathing-related brain rhythms help synchronize sensory and motor behaviors such as sniffing, whisking, and head movements. Likewise, the control of pupil size plays a critical role in processing visual information, adjusting how much the brain can detect and respond to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, though, clear proof connecting breathing to pupil changes had been missing. Earlier studies struggled with small sample sizes and inconsistent methods, leaving the link between &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/exercise-in-a-bottle-drug-helps-the-body-burn-more-fat-use-energy-more-efficiently/"&gt;respiration&lt;/a&gt; and vision largely unexplored—until this discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To clarify this connection, the research team conducted five carefully controlled experiments with over 200 participants. Their findings confirmed that breathing consistently influenced pupil size across various conditions, whether participants were breathing quickly or slowly, through the nose or mouth, in bright or dim lighting, at rest, or engaged in visual tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most striking results was that the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/lifechanging-new-eye-drops-can-make-reading-glasses-obsolete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pupil fluctuations&lt;/a&gt; occurred even in individuals born without an olfactory bulb, a brain structure typically associated with nasal breathing. This suggests that the brainstem alone may regulate the effect, highlighting its deep evolutionary roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Polar plots of participants’ pupil sizes over the course of the breathing cycle. 0° (Inh) marks the onset of inhalation, 90° marks peak inhalation, 180° (Exh) marks the onset of exhalation, and 270° marks peak exhalation.

Pupil size directly affects how light enters the eye, influencing visual acuity. A smaller pupil, like a camera lens set to a narrow aperture, enhances sharpness and depth of field, making it easier to see fine details. A larger pupil, by contrast, allows more light to enter, improving sensitivity to dim or distant objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that our vision may switch between optimizing for distinguishing small details when we inhale and detecting faint objects when we exhale, all within a single breathing cycle,” says Martin Schaefer, a postdoctoral researcher at Karolinska Institutet and the study’s first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this effect is strong enough to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/drawings-from-children-reveal-their-perceptions-and-experiences-of-the-covid-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;impact perception&lt;/a&gt;, it could have significant implications for daily activities. Tasks requiring high visual precision, such as reading or threading a needle, might be easier when inhaling. Meanwhile, scanning for movement in low light, such as spotting a shadow at night, might be enhanced during exhalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Pupil size in participants with and without olfactory bulbs.

The autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary bodily functions, regulates both breathing and pupil response. Abnormalities in this system can signal neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One potential application is new methods to diagnose or treat neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease, where damage to pupil function is an early sign of the disease,” says Arshamian. “This is something we want to explore in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pupil measurements are already used in clinical settings to assess brain function, detect &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/the-remarkable-success-of-new-brain-injury-implant-patients-choose-to-keep-them-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain injuries&lt;/a&gt;, and monitor states of consciousness.

And that includes our teeth and mouths. "Teeth take quite a journey as time goes by," says cosmetic dentist &lt;a href="https://www.drdavidwagner.com/" target="_self"&gt;Dr. David Wagner&lt;/a&gt;, DDS. "As we age, our mouths go through some interesting shifts. Gums may start to pull back, making teeth appear longer and exposing their roots. Saliva production tends to slow down, which can lead to dryness and a higher chance of cavities." Your medications may even affect your oral health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;These are the age-related oral changes you should be aware of when it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/personal-care/want-a-healthier-smile-in-2025-try-these-dentist-approved-tips/" target="_self"&gt;your smile&lt;/a&gt;, and what experts say you can do to prevent them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Aging and oral health &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Dusanpetkovic/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like the rest of your body, your mouth changes as you age -- even if you haven't noticed. Your teeth may have shifted, your mouth might feel drier and things are just a bit different than they were 10 or 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we age, our mouth undergoes several changes," says Dr. James Heaton, cosmetic dentist and &lt;a href="https://smilesofchandler.com/" target="_self"&gt;owner of Smiles of Chandler&lt;/a&gt;. "The tissues in the mouth, including the gums and cheeks, can start to lose elasticity, leading to sagging or changes in the way teeth fit together. Saliva production may also decrease, which can contribute to dry mouth and affect overall oral health. Additionally, the jawbone can weaken over time, potentially leading to a change in bite and an increased risk of tooth loss."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your teeth also change as you age. The enamel starts to wear down, which can increase sensitivity and staining and make them much more fragile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cosmetic dentist Dr. Michael J. Wei, DDS, founder of Manhattan Cosmetic in New York City, says, "Aging can lead to tooth loss due to factors like gum disease, decay and poor oral hygiene habits over the years and teeth may shift or change shape over time, which can affect your bite and overall oral health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4 common age-related dental changes &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Valt/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you get older, you're prone to some oral health-related issues. The dental experts broke down a few of the most common ones that people experience so you can be aware of what to look out for -- and what to talk to your dentist about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Oral cancer &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is an increased risk of oral cancer as you age, which is why Dr. Wei highly recommends getting screened early and often. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Another important factor to note is that the risk of oral cancer increases with age, so oral cancer screenings are very important," he says. "Make sure you regularly visit your dentist so that any dental problems can be addressed in order to maintain optimal oral health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/research/data-statistics/oral-cancer/incidence" target="_self"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; show that the risk of oral cancer increases after age 40 and is significantly higher in men than in women. While the risk continues to rise with age across all races and genders, the highest concentration is found in non-Hispanic white males between the ages of 65 and 74.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Gum disease &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older adults are also more likely to experience gum disease. While gum disease can happen at any point in your life, this inflammation can creep up more prevalently later on and cause greater tooth problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gum disease can become more of a concern, potentially leading to tooth loss if not managed effectively," Dr. Wagner says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wei adds that gum disease -- which occurs when the gums become inflamed and, if left untreated, begin to recede and wear down -- can lead to even more serious oral health issues. He echoes Dr. Wagner in warning that it can ultimately result in tooth loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dry mouth &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Wei, having a dry mouth becomes more of a problem as you get older. He notes that saliva production can decrease as you age, which means some people have more problems with having dry mouths, which leads to "oral health issues." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wagner adds that dry mouths in older people also means that their teeth decay faster. This is because saliva helps keep germs at bay in your mouth. When the saliva decreases, it's harder to maintain oral health, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/health-info/dry-mouth" target="_self"&gt;National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, many medications contribute to dry mouth, which is also why it can be a common problem for older adults. Fortunately, dry mouth can be treated if you speak to your doctor about it. Drinking plenty of water also helps combat this issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tooth decay&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tooth decay, or cavities, can happen to many older adults as the enamel starts to break down on teeth with age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Decay can become more common, especially around older fillings or on exposed roots, especially in the presence of a dryer mouth," Dr. Wagner says, noting that this is when that dry mouth becomes a compound problem because it leads to so many issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Wei, certain medications can also contribute to tooth decay. That's why it's important to mention any prescriptions to both your doctor and dentist if your teeth start to show signs of trouble -- a medication could be the underlying cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to care for aging teeth and gums &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Enigma Images/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Go to the dentist regularly&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that regular dentist visits are a must. This is something you should be doing throughout your life, but it's even more important as you get older because your teeth and mouth are more fragile. "It's essential for older adults to step up their dental care routine. Regular dental visits are key to catching problems early," Dr. Wagner says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Maintain a proper diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sticking to a proper diet will not only keep your body healthy, but your teeth, too. Dr. Wei says, "Make sure to have a balanced diet rich in calcium, vitamin D and other essential nutrients for healthy teeth and gums." Avoiding too much sugar is also a good idea, Dr. Wagner adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Take care of dentures&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you wear dentures, Dr. Heaton says it's crucial to make sure they properly fit your mouth (no matter your age, but especially if you're older, as your mouth and gums slightly change shape). Because these are sitting on your gums day in and day out, they need to fit well -- so he recommends treating them with the utmost care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Stay hydrated&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because older people are at higher risk for dry mouth, all three dental professionals recommend drinking plenty of water to keep your mouth moist. It's not a bad idea to even use saliva replacements. "Staying hydrated is also essential to combat dry mouth, as a lack of saliva can increase the risk of tooth decay," Dr. Heaton says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Use fluoride&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three dentists sing the praises of fluoride to keep your teeth clean and strong. Dr. Wagner says, "Using remineralizing agents such as fluoride and hydroxyapatite products helps strengthen enamel and protect against decay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;andreswd/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we age, our mouths, along with the rest of our bodies, change. Keeping a close eye on your teeth can help you catch common issues like gum disease early, so you can address them before they worsen. Frequent visits to the dentist are important, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/personal-care/best-electric-toothbrush/" target="_self"&gt;regular brushing&lt;/a&gt; and flossing and a proper diet rich in vitamins and minerals (and not too much sugar). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 11:24:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxQTndVQ01iamUtUWlIN21PRjlDVWpON0c0ZC1VYkx1a0lvVHFpMVN3X2JUdklxZTBiM2NzMVNWT3d1Tnh3LTlNNkVpeFFoOGFCTlpFdmNmWkIwbmt4OS1LdlZvTDczYXBabDM4ZHBtTHFzdTc1dENrZ21uWWFDTW5QbXd2TVdTbGp3Y3JPdVExbXhCN3ppeDZJMGdR</guid></item><item><title>加州大学旧金山分校医生的突破性多发性硬化症治疗改变了数百万人的治疗-旧金山纪事报 | Breakthrough multiple sclerosis therapy by UCSF doctor transforms treatment for millions - San Francisco Chronicle</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxQa29JV2Yxd2tiWUsyYXJZREMtSEd0bnhQc1M3QTlQcWhnRDVDVTQtcDRNR19ZTkdvMVVJRkVyX1FWbFowU0lxRTM5aDhaZ2o2ck5McmtNTm1ZdHNWMkdDWWdETURkb1c1aVFKdm1KZ193cGk0cmZBV3lPM2VPdk9JWk5zSXhYTDY0MGc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="rel"&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:-mx40 lg:-mx56 x100vw sm:cw-80 lg:cw-112 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Stephen Hauser, director of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences, helped develop a game-changing drug that may help most people with multiple sclerosis live full lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stephen Lam/S.F.

He pledged to tackle a disease that at the time had almost no treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was more than 40 years ago, and a therapy that Hauser championed — through repeated setbacks and the discouragement of people who didn’t believe what he was doing would work — has now completely altered the course of multiple sclerosis for the most common form of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="A300" data-large-id="CONCERT1" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drugs targeting the B-cell culprits in the relapsing form of MS can leave patients essentially symptom-free. Millions of people worldwide are on the drugs, the first line of which were approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And relapsing MS “is now in the rearview mirror,” said Hauser, a neuro-immunologist and head of UCSF’s Weill Institute for Neurosciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;‘A poster child for what is possible’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work, Hauser said, demonstrates the immense time, effort and expense it takes to understand complicated human diseases and develop effective treatments — but also how the investment can have profound effects on human lives. He noted that in the current political climate, and especially given &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/trump-research-grants-college-20290739.php" data-link="native" class=""&gt;cuts to federal funding for medical research&lt;/a&gt;, it’s more important than ever to celebrate clinical successes and support the careers of future doctor-scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When biomedical research is perceived to be threatened, great young people can conclude that this just isn’t a secure career,” Hauser said. “And yet we are entering a new era where these brain diseases are understandable, treatable and down the road even preventable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT1" data-large-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Multiple sclerosis is in many ways a poster child for what is possible,” Hauser said. “We all want a world free of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s and ALS and stroke. And autism and psychosis and depression. But to make this happen, we need to nurture the next generation of young people, and they really need encouragement because it’s a very difficult path.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hauser’s entire career centered around this work, and he’s partnered with dozens of other scientists around the world to chip at the solutions. Developing the drugs that have changed the course of MS cost more than $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Hauser, 75, won the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, which included a $3 million award. He shared his award with a Harvard scientist who has identified a viral infection as an important risk factor for MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Breakthrough Prizes were created 14 years ago by a team of philanthropists led by Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and Dr. Priscilla Chan. Hauser was named for his work in identifying B cells as the driver of most of the damage caused by MS, which for years was considered a dangerous theory, and for leading the effort to develop new therapies targeting B cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hauser “overturned the scientific consensus on the mechanism of MS, identifying the immune system’s B cells as the primary driver of damage to nerve cells,” according to the Breakthrough Prize Foundation, which delivered the award. His work developing therapies has “revolutionized modern treatment of the disease,” the foundation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="B300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Autoimmune condition affects millions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis affects about half a million people in the United States and millions more worldwide. It’s an autoimmune condition in which immune cells attack the body’s nervous system — specifically, the myelin, or insulation, that surrounds nerve cells and allows them to communicate with one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disrupting cellular communication can lead to cellular death and a variety of health issues, from numbness or pain in the arms and legs to vision problems, muscle weakness and fatigue. Patients may struggle with fine motor skills like buttoning a shirt or holding a paintbrush, or MS could cause brain fog or memory gaps. Some patients must use a wheelchair. Symptoms often are unpredictable and come on suddenly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 85% of MS patients have the relapsing form, which involves periodic flare-ups followed by stretches of recovery. The remaining patients have progressive MS, which worsens over time. The drugs Hauser developed may alleviate all symptoms in people with relapsing MS and can improve symptoms for people with the progressive form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They reduce inflammation by 99%,” Hauser said. “People on these drugs for relapsing MS have less than one attack per lifetime.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Hauser entered the field of MS research in the late 1970s, there were no treatments and the disease was poorly understood. Scientists knew it was caused by inflammation, but they were just beginning to learn what triggered the inflammation. Work out of Europe pointed to patients’ own immune systems, and Hauser decided to test that by treating patients in the U.S. with strong chemotherapy drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He published his first report in 1984: The results were bittersweet. Hauser’s work supported the concept that MS was an autoimmune disorder, which was an important finding. And patients’ symptoms were controlled while they were on chemotherapy, but they resurfaced after a few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was devastated by this, but my patients were happy,” Hauser said. “They welcomed their time free of the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Key focus on B cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, Hauser decided to focus on developing an accurate model that would replicate the human disease in marmosets, a squirrel-like monkey. For years scientists had been working with mouse models that didn’t mirror the human experience of disease very well, leading to some missteps and barriers in the search for drug therapies. Most notably, mouse models had identified T cells as the immune cell culprits, but Hauser and others were convinced B cells were the main villain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="S300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once he had a solid disease model, Hauser and his team were able to get a better image of how MS damaged nerve cells and identify potential drug targets. Then in the 1990s, biotech firm Genentech developed the first antibody designed to target B cells. It was used to treat a form of cancer, but Hauser wanted to try this antibody on people with MS, which could both prove that B cells were involved and demonstrate whether killing them would improve symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a tough sell. The National Institutes of Health, which had supported earlier research by Hauser, refused to fund this work because it was “biologically implausible,” Hauser recalled. Genentech models gave the antibody drug a 15% chance of success. The company would fund only a very small, very short trial of a low dose that would essentially test if the drug had any effect at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was our only shot on goal — to understand if removing B cells could help patients,” Hauser said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So tensions were high when they finally got the results. Hauser remembers the exact day: Aug. 26, 2006. “It was a gorgeous Friday afternoon in the Bay Area,” he said, “and we saw the best possible results.” Brain lesions, a telltale sign of MS, were reduced 90%; patients reported 50% fewer flare-ups. His partner at Genentech broke down in tears of relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That first trial used a chemotherapy drug, so Hauser and his team next worked to develop the same antibody therapy but better suited to MS patients. In 2017, the FDA approved ocrelizumab, the first in a new class of therapies for MS. Millions of people are now on the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Landscape architect Sarah Warto, who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at age 20, tends to a plant in her backyard in San Carlos. Since she began taking the drug ocrelizumab, developed by UCSF doctor Stephen Hauser and his team, she has been essentially symptom-free for almost seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stephen Lam/S.F.

Her symptoms at first were alarming, but mild: tingling in her hands, strange sensations in her torso, a leg that would stubbornly drag when she walked. The treatment also was cumbersome: She had to give herself injections three times a week, of a drug that had to constantly be kept cold. It wasn’t an easy regimen for an active woman in her 20s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Warto managed until she had her first child in 2014. Shortly after her daughter was born, Warto’s symptoms worsened. Her legs became so unsteady she feared she would stumble and drop the baby. She would get fatigued after walking just one block or up the stairs to her third-floor walk-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having a baby and seeing my own limitations, for the first time MS scared me,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warto was under Hauser’s care by then, so she knew he was studying a potentially exciting new therapy. She decided to put off having a second child until 2018, when she knew she could take ocrelizumab, which was still considered experimental. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The second baby was night and day,” Warto said. Her symptoms never fully returned after she started the therapy, which she now gets twice a year via an infusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warto has been essentially symptom-free for almost seven years. Her leg will sometimes drag after a workout or if she gets overheated, but otherwise she has no issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I almost feel like a fraud,” Warto said with a laugh. “If I mention to somebody that I have MS, they get this doom-and-gloom look. And I have to reframe that it is not my life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The therapy is not a cure, and there remain many challenges in treating multiple sclerosis, including finding durable treatments for people with the progressive form. Scientists are identifying the earliest markers of the disease, in hopes that someday soon they will be able to prevent it entirely. They’re also looking at therapies to undo the damage caused by MS to those who have been living with it for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I never thought I’d still be in the trenches at 75,” Hauser said with a chuckle. “But this is all too exciting and too important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>San Francisco Chronicle</author><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 11:11:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxQa29JV2Yxd2tiWUsyYXJZREMtSEd0bnhQc1M3QTlQcWhnRDVDVTQtcDRNR19ZTkdvMVVJRkVyX1FWbFowU0lxRTM5aDhaZ2o2ck5McmtNTm1ZdHNWMkdDWWdETURkb1c1aVFKdm1KZ193cGk0cmZBV3lPM2VPdk9JWk5zSXhYTDY0MGc</guid></item><item><title>这些老龄化专家，现在是老年人自己，对事情的看法不同-《华盛顿邮报》 | These experts on aging, now seniors themselves, see things differently - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxOb2FZYWdBdDhMV3FxSFpSMmRkZkdrQ29jQWtHMDRjY3loWUhCcDY1XzQ4Vm01cWYxVVFZSkE0U3dTeXVYcFdmaGpBWE9OWDZPTFA3TE5ZWG5heUd4NXU1MWJSTVZlMlplT183N09iX3RoYUhsUjI1VGNNWVl4eE5LODJEYmVHNTVGRmdpWmJRWEhlQTFSNldDUlhR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LIVGLWUSJJCWZJ5MVKNM3WKBOI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As a social worker for older adults, Robyn Golden, 67, preached the importance of staying active as you age.

But she didn’t realize how hard it could be for an older person. Last year, for example, she took up pickleball.

So it’s not surprising that he gets asked one question over and over: What’s the best way to grow old?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UGPM75AAP5HUXNG6GS4SLFW2BY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When he was younger, the Baltimore-based doctor had a set of standard health recommendations for older people: exercise and eat well, though no need to avoid the occasional glass of wine or dessert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CM6YIQYMDNG2FMWCJUOUFBL6JU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But as he has eased into senior citizenship, Leff saw greater nuance. “As you get older, you understand different aspects of life,” Leff said. “You’ve had your own experiences, you’re more empathetic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JZSM77XV7FGVVC4RYSBIUPE5TQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Resilience, Leff said, is a popular term among doctors, who urge their patients to stay tough through discomfort or unpleasantness until things return to normal. Now he’s come to see adaptation — adjusting and accepting what life throws your way — as equally important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U5K4CYPIUFED3ONYOWJL2HQSBM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Many of his patients are struggling with life-changing events, such as the death of a spouse, a cancer diagnosis or even retirement. Though many go through a period of “feeling a bit lost,” he said, “the vast, vast, vast majority of people find their way to seeking happiness and purpose and meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KJYZTUSHRVCFHODB6X3MOOIW44" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Ellen Langer, a 78-year-old Harvard University psychology professor, who studies the connection between mind and body, says that viewing aging positively — and focusing on what you are able to do, not what you can’t — can improve your health and mental state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CTU4U6ALBFCRXD4ZWFMJ44MCYE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Much of the research she does has focused on how to stay happy through old age. In one &lt;a href="https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2010/08/the-mindfulness-chronicles" target="_blank"&gt;well-known experiment, &lt;/a&gt;eight septuagenarians were briefly moved into a facility that had been meticulously styled to resemble the world as the subjects knew it 20 years ago. They were all encouraged to live as if they were their younger selves. After the experiment ended, Langer found that many of the subjects had improved vision and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JS555UJAWZFE5LJ6FLKDOQUQP4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As Langer has gotten older, she hasn’t suffered the same discontents as many of her peers because she said she avoids the negative thinking about aging that traps other people. “I don’t walk around experiencing my age,” she said. “Age is not a relevant dimension to me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NL4ELG4BXNDYFM6QV27756QIOE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don’t get discouraged — and don’t be too hard on yourself&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M2Y6HCOTWBGZDMBBUQXXYVOCBY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Michael Schuchert, a 54-year-old personal trainer who primarily works with older clients at DeHenzel Training Systems in northern Virginia and D.C., always knew the importance of being fit, but he only became interested in training after a running injury pushed him into physical therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5RM6PPDRKBCU5EKBGBEVK56C5M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Schuchert realized that he needed to adjust his routine to his changing body. His clients, who range in age from their 40s to 80s, do as well. Some are interested in building upper-body strength so that they can pick up their grandchildren. Another wanted to improve her balance after a bicycle accident caused some neurological issues. One recent milestone: She was able to put on her pants while balancing on one leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XGGZQFFIF5AMBKYG7CYXVCGDFE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“As I’ve aged, I’ve started to feel more aches and pains,” Schuchert said. He finds his body is a little more delicate now, and it takes longer to recovery from injuries. “I need that core [muscle] … because I still have 25, 30-plus years ahead of me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2ODEUZZ6C5EXXN5O3QXUZ7HJCM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Golden said that as a younger social worker, she didn’t always see the appeal of shared senior living, with its exercise classes and group activities. But now she finds the idea of a comfortable living space much more attractive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VYNNZKVXKRF7HFTMIO6QWLNXBE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This taught her to focus closely on the interests of her patients, even if she didn’t connect to their desires. “We can’t put people in boxes,” she said. “I think that’s what I’ve learned.” She’s trying to do the same for herself, even as she continues to think about new hobbies, such as mastering a musical instrument, and traveling more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JRRQKYYJ3VF7LIXI5RJ6IO6UHM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I always assumed I have to learn to play cards,” at some point, she said, because that’s what the older people she knew did. And while researchers have also found that playing cards or other games regularly can improve brain health, Golden now realizes it may not be for her. “Maybe I’ll try it,” she said. “But maybe not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 11:01:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOb2FZYWdBdDhMV3FxSFpSMmRkZkdrQ29jQWtHMDRjY3loWUhCcDY1XzQ4Vm01cWYxVVFZSkE0U3dTeXVYcFdmaGpBWE9OWDZPTFA3TE5ZWG5heUd4NXU1MWJSTVZlMlplT183N09iX3RoYUhsUjI1VGNNWVl4eE5LODJEYmVHNTVGRmdpWmJRWEhlQTFSNldDUlhR</guid></item><item><title>您有“幽灵大便”吗？以下是关于您健康的信息。- HuffPost | Do You Have 'Ghost Poops'?

Though there may be no evidence left in the pot, your poop might look like a piece of sausage that’s smooth and soft. “I would consider that to be an absolutely perfect poop,” Barten said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/ira-leeds/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Ira Leeds" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6767e4b01f53dc43f296" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/ira-leeds/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Ira Leeds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a Yale Medicine colorectal surgeon, said ghost poops — or nirvana poops, as he calls them — easily (but noticeably) pass through the anal canal, sink to the bottom of the toilet, and leave no residue when wiping. These three factors are indicative of good bowel health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A bowel movement that easily moves through the anal canal typically has an ideal consistency, according to Leeds. As such, you don’t have to push as hard. This, in turn, minimizes straining and toilet time, which can both lead to complications like hemorrhoids and anal fissures, he explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Floating poops typically have a higher fat content, which causes them to stay on the surface of the water. But when your poop sinks? This suggests your digestion is functioning well. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Fats, proteins and carbohydrates are being broken down properly into their constitutive parts that can be used by the body effectively,” Leeds said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally, seeing a lot of residue on the toilet paper when wiping could mean you have an underlying health issue. According to Leeds, if you have to wipe at least three times, you may want to investigate.

In general, a high-fiber diet will bulk up your stool so that it looks like the Type 4 poo on that Bristol Stool Scale. Aim to consume 25 to 30 grams of fiber a day, according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes-prevention/media/pdfs/legacy/Participant-Module-22_More_About_Carbs.pdf" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6767e4b01f53dc43f296" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes-prevention/media/pdfs/legacy/Participant-Module-22_More_About_Carbs.pdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The more fiber you eat, the better your stool consistency will be, the easier it’ll be to go to the bathroom, and the less toilet paper you’ll need, Leeds said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many people have food sensitivities and intolerances. So, it’s worth being aware of how you react to various foods and drinks. The reason: “Avoiding foods that irritate your gut is important for having well-formed stools,” Barten said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5357536/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Evidence" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6767e4b01f53dc43f296" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5357536/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Evidence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; also shows that exercise can improve your bowel movements. “Regular cardiovascular exercise improves nervous system regulation and movement literally helps things move better — our joints, our muscles and our bowels,” Barten said.

When you participate in an aerobic activity like pickleball, your body releases &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23040-endorphins#:~:text=Endorphins%20are%20chemicals%20(hormones)%20your,your%20sense%20of%20well-being." role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="endorphins" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6651e4b01f53dc43f142" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23040-endorphins#:~:text=Endorphins%20are%20chemicals%20(hormones)%20your,your%20sense%20of%20well-being." data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;endorphins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, or hormones that relieve pain, reduce stress, and boost well-being. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Playing pickleball is also a fun and efficient way of meeting the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/adults/index.htm" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="recommended guidance for physical activity" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6651e4b01f53dc43f142" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/adults/index.htm" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;recommended guidance for physical activity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise a week). Physical activity is known to improve quality of life and promote healthy aging, especially in older adults, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1524938/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="evidence" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6651e4b01f53dc43f142" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1524938/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;&lt;span&gt;evidence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; consistently shows. And, as the Apple report revealed, pickleball games last roughly 90 minutes on average, helping you knock out half the amount of weekly physical activity needed in just one session. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pickleball also gives people the opportunity to stay connected with friends and family or develop new relationships. When people join leagues, for example, they might form a new sense of community and belonging. Plus, it’s inclusive: You can play with people of all ages, skill levels and backgrounds. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Humans thrive when we experience connection, and pickleball allows us to bond with one another through an activity that also physically makes us feel good,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/29092" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Emily Hemendinger" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6651e4b01f53dc43f142" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/29092" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Emily Hemendinger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, an assistant professor in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/psychiatry" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="department of psychiatry" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6651e4b01f53dc43f142" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/psychiatry" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;&lt;span&gt;department of psychiatry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It can also provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment. “Playing a sport, such as pickleball, can give people a goal to work towards, whether it’s winning a game, meeting people, or improving one’s skills,” Hemendinger said. Winning, in particular, can lead to a sense of pride and accomplishment, she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pickleball Keeps Your Brain Sharp, Too&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another theory from MacRae as to why pickleball can be such a mood booster: playing pickleball outdoors may increase exposure to natural daylight. And the more natural light we’re exposed to, the better our sleep quality, activity levels, and overall quality of life are, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; suggests. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s not all. The game also requires people to pay attention and think quickly and strategically. If you get distracted, for example, you run the risk of getting hit in the face with the ball or letting down your partner. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/exercise-can-boost-your-memory-and-thinking-skills" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Physical activities" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6651e4b01f53dc43f142" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/exercise-can-boost-your-memory-and-thinking-skills" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="13"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Physical activities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that require strategic thinking promote cognitive functioning, which can help prevent &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8932955/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="cognitive decline" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6651e4b01f53dc43f142" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8932955/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;&lt;span&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “Some studies have even found that sports like pickleball and racket sports can improve memory and processing speed,” Hemendinger said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In short: pickleball not only works out your body, it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/racket-sports-serve-up-health-benefits-2017060911780" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="exercises your mind" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6651e4b01f53dc43f142" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/racket-sports-serve-up-health-benefits-2017060911780" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="15"&gt;&lt;span&gt;exercises your mind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Following this no-sugar meal plan for a week made a huge difference in my life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I experienced more energy, fewer sugar cravings and thought less about food.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed the recipes so much that some have made it into my weekly rotation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A few weeks ago, I decided to embark on a challenge: Following an &lt;em&gt;EatingWell&lt;/em&gt; meal plan for a week. I’m not much of a meal planner or prepper, but I aspire to be, and I liked the idea of following a curated menu. And I can honestly say I was surprised at some of the changes I experienced as far as my cravings and relationship with food in just that one week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/can-your-diet-ease-seasonal-allergies-11709305" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;spring allergies&lt;/a&gt;, various food sensitivities and affinity for added sugar, a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-no-sugar-anti-inflammatory-meal-plan-for-weight-loss-8612457" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;7-Day No-Sugar, Anti-Inflammatory Meal Plan&lt;/a&gt; seemed like just the thing. Over the course of a week, my husband and I tried new recipes and filled our fridge and bodies with healthy foods. The recipes were delicious and the portions were generous. Here are the biggest things that happened when I followed an &lt;em&gt;EatingWell &lt;/em&gt;meal plan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-i-experienced-sugar-withdrawalthen-stopped-craving-it-entirely"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; I Experienced Sugar Withdrawal…Then Stopped Craving It Entirely &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Anyone who knows me knows that I have a sweet tooth, and a pretty big one at that. I look forward to having a bite of something sweet after a meal, and not just after dinner. Decreasing my added sugar intake has been a personal goal for a long time, but as an emotional eater who keeps sugary foods stocked in their house, I hadn’t made any real progress until my week following the meal plan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; True to its name, the no-sugar, anti-inflammatory meal plan does not include foods containing added sugars. The only sugars I consumed that week were naturally occurring; found in fruits, vegetables and unsweetened dairy. Instead of chocolate bars and cookies, I ate blueberries and kefir, beets, pears and sliced oranges. It was definitely a huge shift for me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I noticed the change to my diet almost immediately, with some pretty intense headaches and brain fog on the first two days. Despite these challenges, I didn’t deviate from the meal plan. I continued to prepare and enjoy all the meals and snacks, but definitely felt a bit out of it at first. It wasn’t a fun feeling, but by day three of following the plan, I felt much better. And even more surprisingly, I find myself wanting a sugary bite after every meal less often now. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Don’t get me wrong, I still enjoy my sugar-sweetened desserts. But now I do it more mindfully, paying attention to the texture and flavor, and savoring every bite.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-i-had-more-energy-despite-spending-more-time-preparing-food"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; I Had More Energy, Despite Spending More Time Preparing Food &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I won’t sugarcoat it (ha!) The recipes in this meal plan are pretty involved, with some having lengthy ingredient lists and several steps to prepare. But since I like cooking, work from home and had help from my husband with preparing the meals, it was manageable. In fact, some of the recipes that I initially balked at due to their long ingredient lists have made it into my regular rotation of meals, snacks and sides. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not only are these recipes delicious, but they’re also packed with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292071/the-best-foods-to-eat-to-fight-inflammation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory foods&lt;/a&gt; like dark leafy greens, legumes and nuts. Foods like spinach, kale, chickpeas and nuts deliver nutrients that helped me feel my best during that week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Despite spending more time shopping for ingredients, cooking and washing dishes, I found that I had more energy during the week I followed the meal plan. I felt more rested when it was time to get up in the morning, and didn’t fall asleep on the couch after dinner—a common ritual that I had normalized. This seems a little obvious, especially now that I reflect on it, but I’m still amazed at how much of a difference a week made and how much better I felt with some tweaks to my diet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-i-thought-about-food-less"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; I Thought About Food Less &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I’m the type of person who thinks about their next meal while they’re currently eating one. I love food, write about food and edit food articles for a living, so it’s on my mind a lot. But that wasn’t the case during the week I followed the meal plan. Not only was I more satisfied after meals, but I didn’t have any cravings or feel the need to mindlessly snack. And though it was a busy and moderately stressful week for me, I wasn’t inclined to unwind with a glass of wine or a sweet bite. My relationship with food is complicated, and I’m still working on it, but I definitely felt a lot less anxiety about food and eating while following the meal plan. And with a meal and snack plan in place and my fridge and pantry stocked with all the necessary ingredients, it was a lot easier to adhere to a specific eating pattern.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not to be dramatic, but this meal plan changed my life. Though I didn’t make every single recipe, filling my fridge with fresh fruits and vegetables and taking a break from added sugar made a difference in so many aspects of my life in just one short week. I’m less interested in foods packed with added sugar, have more energy and overall less obsessive about food. It’s been a few weeks since I followed this meal plan, yet recipes like the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250486/chickpea-potato-hash/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chickpea &amp;amp; Potato Hash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/277838/feta-kale-pear-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Feta, Kale &amp;amp; Pear Salad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/258084/peanut-butter-oat-energy-balls/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Peanut Butter-Oat Energy Balls&lt;/a&gt; have made it into my weekly rotation.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fiber is crucial for reducing colorectal cancer risk by keeping the digestive tract moving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Short-chain fatty acids from fiber fermentation may protect against colorectal cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To lower your risk, eat more plant-based foods, stay active and limit alcohol and processed meats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Colorectal cancer, frequently referred to as colon or rectum cancer, is the fourth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Approximately 4% of adults will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer in their lifetime, with an estimated 154,270 individuals likely to be diagnosed in 2025 alone, according to the Colorectal Cancer Alliance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some risk factors for colorectal cancer can’t be changed, like your age, sex, genetics and personal or family history of colorectal polyps or colorectal cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, your diet is a key risk factor that you do have control over. In fact, registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://karencollinsnutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Karen Collins, M.S., RDN, CDN, FAND,&lt;/a&gt; nutrition advisor to the American Institute for Cancer Research, says, “Colorectal cancer is considered one of the cancers most influenced by diet and lifestyle. Our daily choices make a difference!” While your overall eating pattern makes the biggest difference when it comes to colorectal cancer risk, fiber is the most important nutrient for minimizing your risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Fiber is truly a powerhouse when it comes to helping to protect your colon,” says board-certified oncology dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.wholesomellc.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alison Tierney, M.S., RD, CSO&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Wholesome LLC. In this article, dietitians explain why fiber is the No. 1 nutrient to help reduce your risk of colorectal cancer and share other strategies for prevention.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research shows that both &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;soluble and insoluble fiber&lt;/a&gt; may help reduce the risk of colorectal cancer by keeping food moving through your digestive tract.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Soluble fiber softens stools, making them easier to pass, while insoluble fiber adds bulk to your stool and draws water into your colon to keep things moving. Besides making your bathroom visits more pleasant, staying regular may also help prevent colorectal cancer by reducing the amount of time colon cells are exposed to potential cancer-promoting compounds that may be in your stool. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tierney puts it more simply: “This means less time for harmful substances to hang around and potentially damage the cells lining your colon.” For optimal benefits, aim to eat a variety of fiber-rich foods, like whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, fruits and vegetables, throughout the day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unlike many nutrients, fiber isn’t digestible. Instead, it gets fermented by bacteria in the gut, producing short-chain fatty acids, like butyrate, which offer some pretty impressive health benefits. Emerging research suggests that these short-chain fatty acids may help protect against (and possibly slow down the progression of) colorectal cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Short-chain fatty acids [may] protect colorectal cells from damage [by] reducing markers of inflammation and showing effects on gene expression that could reduce cancer development,” says Collins.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Short-chain fatty acids may also help reduce overweight and obesity—additional risk factors for colorectal cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to one study, people with type 2 diabetes have a 47% increased risk of colorectal cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While the exact mechanism is unclear, it’s thought that this higher risk is due to higher levels of insulin in people with diabetes. There are many contributing factors to diabetes. However, a high-fiber diet may be protective by improving &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-have-insulin-resistance-8400321" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;—a condition that, over time, can lead to type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Eating more fiber usually means you’re eating more whole plant foods—like fruits, veggies, beans and whole grains—which also come packed with antioxidants and cancer-fighting nutrients,” says Tierney. Research suggests that antioxidants in fiber components may be especially beneficial for colon health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Because they aren’t digested, these antioxidants make their way into the colon where they can help reduce inflammation and support intestinal health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-strategies-to-lower-your-risk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Strategies to Lower Your Risk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating more fiber is just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to lowering your risk of colorectal cancer. “Rates of early-onset colorectal cancer (occurring in people under age 50) are rising, and risk is considered to be reduced by these same lifestyle factors as colorectal cancer that occurs in older adults,” says Collins. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are a few strategies for reducing your risk: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cut Back on Processed and Red Meats: &lt;/strong&gt;Eating red or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/food-to-limit-for-healthy-blood-pressure-11710466" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;processed meats&lt;/a&gt;, including bacon, deli meats and sausage, is linked with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. The American Institute for Cancer Research recommends consuming no more than 12 to 18 ounces of unprocessed red meat (like beef, pork and lamb) per week and avoiding processed meats as much as possible.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit Alcohol Consumption: &lt;/strong&gt;Collins explains that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-alcohol-does-to-your-body-8747903" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; is converted in the body to acetaldehyde, a cancer-promoting compound that damages DNA and makes repairing this damage harder. If you choose to drink, Collins recommends doing so in moderation, meaning no more than one standard drink per day for women and no more than two for men. Better yet, swap the alcohol for a glass of milk! Thanks to its calcium content and naturally present short-chain fatty acids, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/colorectal-cancer-milk-study-8775172" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;cow’s milk&lt;/a&gt; may help protect against colorectal cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Moving: &lt;/strong&gt;Regular physical activity has numerous benefits for health, including helping to improve insulin sensitivity, reducing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and supporting digestive health—all of which play a role in colorectal cancer risk. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate activity per week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat More Plants. &lt;/strong&gt;While you don’t need to eat plant-based 100% of the time, Tierney says that eating more minimally processed, plant-based foods is one of the best ways to reduce your risk of colorectal cancer. “Whole plant foods give you not just fiber, but also a wide range of nutrients that help reduce inflammation and support a healthy gut and immune system,” she says. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The dietitians we spoke with unanimously agree that fiber is the No. 1 nutrient to eat more of to lower your risk of colorectal cancer. Fermentation of fiber in the gut leads to the production of short-chain fatty acids, which may have anticancer effects and support weight management. Fiber is also beneficial thanks to its positive effects on gut health, insulin resistance and chronic inflammation. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to cancer prevention, there’s no one magic nutrient or habit. Instead, your overall lifestyle will have the biggest impact. Staying physically active, limiting alcohol intake, prioritizing plant-based foods and eating less red meat and processed meats are key strategies for prevention. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
