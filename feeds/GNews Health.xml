  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmffsr3ex000h3b79n86jgyf3@published"&gt;My younger sister “Harper” just shared with me that she and her husband are excited to be expecting a baby. She told me she was only telling our parents and a few trusted family members and asked me to help her keep the news secret until after the baby is born!&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmffss94b000s3b79dk4domyr@published"&gt;I knew immediately that this was because of our older sister “Ronnie.” Ronnie and her husband have struggled with infertility for years. After 10 miscarriages, Ronnie has reached a point where she will not be in the same room with a pregnant woman or a baby if she can help it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="29" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfft8a1u001a3b792njzbkxk@published"&gt;Harper also told me that she is also going to forgo having a baby shower “out of respect for what Ronnie is going through.” I think this is insane.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfft685e00163b79l69fygvt@published"&gt;Yes, what Ronnie is dealing with is devastating for her, but I don’t think she has a right to make everyone around her sacrifice their own enjoyment and milestone events because of it. Should I tell Ronnie about Harper’s pregnancy, and tell her it’s time to suck it up and shut up?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="112" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmffsr3le000k3b79xrvdat9p@published"&gt;I’m not sure why Harper believes it will be any easier for Ronnie to learn about her baby after its birth as opposed to before. But Harper’s pregnancy is her business—it’s her choice who she wants to tell about it, and when. Maybe she wants to enjoy her happy news (assuming she is happy about it) for as long as possible before dealing with Ronnie’s potential feelings about it. In any case, while I know it’s an awkward situation—and it feels weird to know something important about your sister that your other sister doesn’t know—I do think you should probably leave it to Harper to share the news as she sees fit.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="105" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmffsr3n8000l3b79k9zllmp5@published"&gt;I realize you probably wouldn’t tell her in so many words to “suck it up and shut up.” Still, when you phrase it as her holding “the world hostage” and say that she doesn’t have the right to make Harper forgo any joy or celebration, you are overlooking the fact that Ronnie isn’t &lt;em&gt;forcing &lt;/em&gt;Harper to do anything. Obviously it’s not realistic if Ronnie expects to get through life without ever seeing pregnant people and babies. But you don’t know that that’s her plan—sometimes there are things we do to try to take care of ourselves while actively grieving that we don’t necessarily do forever.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmffsr3p2000m3b79mfdu6ktd@published"&gt;Right now, Ronnie is grieving. That is affecting her and her relationships and your family in many ways. It’s okay for you to feel upset or sad or frustrated about that. But Ronnie didn’t choose to experience so many losses, and the timeline of her grieving and healing is not up to you. In the meantime, she hasn’t asked Harper not to have a baby shower “out of respect” for her; she doesn’t even know about the baby.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="123" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmffsr3r1000n3b796vl8r8a1@published"&gt;Whether before or after the birth, your sisters are going to have to figure this out. If the secrecy right now bothers you, you can gently encourage Harper to be open with Ronnie before the baby arrives. (She might not really be “protecting” Ronnie, after all—Ronnie might be even more hurt knowing that Harper felt she couldn’t tell her about the pregnancy.) I don’t know how close your sisters are, but if Harper loves Ronnie enough to forgo a baby shower to try to protect her feelings, maybe they are close enough to talk about this and come to some sort of genuine, if inevitably complicated, understanding—one that allows them to be honest with each other, acknowledging both Harper’s happiness and Ronnie’s pain.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="100" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmffsn81c00axw7kvovsu79ka@published"&gt;I am a happily married middle-aged woman with two girls, “Bailey” (16) and “Sera” (14). They are great sisters. They get along fine for their age, and they enjoy playing video games and reading books together. Bailey is extraordinarily patient with Sera’s anti-social nature, and they share everything together. My husband and I made the decision to homeschool them when Bailey was in first grade, and they are both ahead academically. They also have a great relationship with my husband and me, and although our circle is small, we are happy. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/01/mother-in-law-shot-childs-confidence-comparison-advice.html"&gt;However, we’re experiencing some academic drama as of late.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Travis Rose planned for more than a month to get her family vaccinated against COVID-19 and the flu before their September trip to Disney World. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Less than 24 hours before their Aug. 28 appointment, it was canceled without an explanation. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“No notice, just canceled,” Rose told WRAL News. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Rose said she wanted the vaccines specifically to protect her son, Aiden. The 17-year-old has autism, which the FDA considers a high-risk condition for COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt; “He smells everything, and he’s constantly wanting to touch. He is very sensory-seeking, and he loves to touch his face,” she explained. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;She continued, “We are going to Disney World. We’re talking about the belly of the beast as far as germs are concerned. It’s this fine line between not wanting to hide but wanting to still have quality of life and live life. Vaccines have given us the ability to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 infections in the Orlando area went from 400 cases on July 4, to more than 1,000 cases reported every week for the last three weeks of August, according to the Florida Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Travis Rose said her husband, Joshua Rose, went to a military clinic in Fayetteville to ask how to get vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;He was told that &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/video/coronavirus/video/doctor-s-prescription-required-for-covid-vaccine-at-pharmacies/22152769/"&gt;North Carolina law required a doctor’s note&lt;/a&gt; for the family to get their vaccines if they want them before before the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) releases updated guidance. That isn’t expected to happen until the committee’s upcoming meeting on Sept. 18.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;North Carolina is one of a handful of states with laws &lt;a href="https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/vaccines"&gt;barring pharmacists from administering COVID-19 vaccines until the ACIP releases its recommendations&lt;/a&gt;, unless someone age 18 and up has a prescription written by their doctor&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						
						
							
							
							
						
					
						
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/fayetteville-family-covid-vaccine-hurdles-sept-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/fayetteville-family-covid-vaccine-hurdles-sept-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Rose told WRAL News that she and her husband were able to get their shots with their prescriptions. The parents were told that Aiden Rose could still be vaccinated by a private doctor, but the family then ran into another issue when no private practice near them had the doses in stock. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“In Fayetteville right now, Womack Army Medical Center did not have them, the hospitals and urgent cares did not have them, our clinic doesn’t have them. The only people that have them can’t give them, because it’s a pharmacy thing,” Travis Rose said. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The family spoke to WRAL News on Thursday -- during their drive to Florida -- to express their frustration. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“I did everything I was supposed to do, and we still weren’t able to protect him,” Rose said. “I don’t want my child to die. I don’t want my child to be at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The mother said she had this message to those responsible for the red tape her family was caught in. “This isn’t about politics, this is about allowing parents to protect their children," she said. "Don’t take the tools away from us that allow us to protect our kids.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;After the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip-recs/hcp/vaccine-specific/covid-19.html"&gt;ACIP releases its recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for 2025-26 COVID-19 vaccines, the CDC director still needs to sign off for final approval. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Typically, the ACIP meets soon after the FDA issues its vaccine approvals. The ACIP was dissolved this summer when it typically would provide fall immunization recommendations.  The panel was not reconstituted until August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chicago health officials released a health alert about leptospirosis cases in the city after numerous infections were reported and at least one person died. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contagious bacterial disease has been found in at least four recent cases, the Chicago Department of Public Health told NBC Chicago, with one of those cases resulting in a death. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"All four of the most recent cases, including the patient who died, had either direct contact with animal urine or droppings (primarily rats) or indirect contact through yard work or gardening," the department said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CDPH had recently issued a Health Alert Network alert about leptospirosis earlier this week alerting healthcare providers in the city of the recent cases to "let them know to test patients who may be displaying compatible symptoms." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"&gt;What is leptospirosis?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leptospirosis is a disease that affects many &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/leptospirosis/pets/index.html"&gt;animals&lt;/a&gt;, including dogs, and people and can be found in contaminated water or soil, according to the&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/leptospirosis/about/index.html"&gt; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The bacteria can survive in contaminated water or soil for weeks to months," the CDC reports.&lt;/p&gt;
			
	
&lt;p&gt;If left untreated in humans, the disease can lead to kidney damage, meningitis, liver failure, trouble breathing and even death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the symptoms? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms in humans include: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Chills&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Body or muscle aches&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Vomiting or nausea&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Yellowed skin and eyes (jaundice)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Red eyes&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Stomach pain&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Diarrhea&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Rash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms in dogs and other animals: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lethargy&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Increased thirst&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amcny.org/pet_health_library/vomiting/"&gt;Vomiting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amcny.org/pet_health_library/loss-of-appetite/"&gt;Loss of appetite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amcny.org/pet_health_library/does-my-pet-have-a-fever/"&gt;Fever&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Jaundice (yellow discoloration of skin)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Discolored urine (dark yellow to orange)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Joint or muscle pain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important to note, however, that many animals will show no signs of infection at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For people, the disease can take anywhere from two to 30 days to start showing symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CDC warns it could occur in two phases: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the first phase, people may have fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, vomiting, or diarrhea. The person may feel better for a while but become ill again.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Some people may suffer a more severe second phase with kidney or liver failure, or inflammation of the membrane around the brain and spinal cord (meningitis).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The illness can last from a few days to several weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"&gt;How can you prevent in?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CDPH recommends you: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid contact with floodwater and do not eat food contaminated with floodwater&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Reduce rodent populations:
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Report sightings or suspicions of rodents to 311&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Use a secure lid for trash and compost bins.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Where possible, seal entry points to prevent rats from entering your yard, and reduce standing debris, tall grass, and other items around your yard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Clean up animal urine or feces appropriately by wearing rubber or plastic gloves, cleaning thoroughly with disinfectant, and washing your hands afterwards.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;If doing yardwork/gardening or standing in water:
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cover wounds/scratches/abrasions with waterproof bandages if doing yardwork/gardening or standing in water&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Wear waterproof gloves and closed toe shoes or rubber boots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Talk to your veterinarian about leptospirosis vaccination if you have a pet dog&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The science behind Dr. Patrick’s claims&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Patrick, who completed her postdoctoral fellowship at Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute and currently serves as founder of FoundMyFitness, has &lt;a href="https://www.a4m.com/rhonda-patrick.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.a4m.com/rhonda-patrick.html" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;built her reputation&lt;/a&gt; on translating complex scientific research into actionable health insights. Her academic credentials include published research in journals such as &lt;em&gt;Nature Cell Biology&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;FASEB Journal&lt;/em&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4566436/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4566436/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;extensive work&lt;/a&gt; on aging, nutrition, and disease prevention.&lt;a href="https://www.a4m.com/rhonda-patrick.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.a4m.com/rhonda-patrick.html" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nakednutrition.com/blogs/fitness/the-norwegian-4-4-hiit-protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://nakednutrition.com/blogs/fitness/the-norwegian-4-4-hiit-protocol" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;The Norwegian 4×4 protocol&lt;/a&gt;, developed by researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), involves four rounds of four-minute high-intensity intervals followed by three-minute recovery periods. Patrick described the routine as sustainable intensity exercise where “you’re not really having a conversation while you’re doing it,” but it’s “far from all-out” effort.&lt;a href="https://nakednutrition.com/blogs/fitness/the-norwegian-4-4-hiit-protocol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://nakednutrition.com/blogs/fitness/the-norwegian-4-4-hiit-protocol" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.myworkout.com/en/4x4intervals" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.myworkout.com/en/4x4intervals" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;The exercise can be performed&lt;/a&gt; on various equipment including stationary bikes, rowing machines, or assault bikes, with participants maintaining approximately 75-80% of their maximum heart rate during the active intervals. The total workout, including warm-up and cool-down, takes roughly 30-40 minutes and needs to be performed only once or twice per week.&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/1fcbykh/programs_to_work_up_to_doing_4x4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/1fcbykh/programs_to_work_up_to_doing_4x4/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="1"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protocol’s effectiveness stems from landmark research &lt;a href="https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/1442475-reversing-the-cardiac-effects-of-sedentary-aging-in-middle-age-a-randomized-controlled-trial--implications-for-heart-failure-prevention" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/1442475-reversing-the-cardiac-effects-of-sedentary-aging-in-middle-age-a-randomized-controlled-trial--implications-for-heart-failure-prevention" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Circulation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of the world’s leading cardiovascular journals. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29311053/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29311053/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt;, led by Dr. Benjamin Levine at UT Southwestern Medical Center, followed 61 healthy but sedentary middle-aged adults (average age 53) for two years.&lt;a href="https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/1442475-reversing-the-cardiac-effects-of-sedentary-aging-in-middle-age-a-randomized-controlled-trial--implications-for-heart-failure-prevention" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/1442475-reversing-the-cardiac-effects-of-sedentary-aging-in-middle-age-a-randomized-controlled-trial--implications-for-heart-failure-prevention" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who followed a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180108090132.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180108090132.htm" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;structured exercise program&lt;/a&gt; that included the Norwegian 4×4 protocol once weekly showed remarkable improvements: an 18% increase in maximum oxygen uptake (VO2 max) and a more than 25% improvement in left ventricular compliance, effectively reversing structural heart changes by approximately 20 years.&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180108090132.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180108090132.htm" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we age, our hearts get smaller and stiffer,” Patrick said during her Diary of a CEO interview. “After those two years of 5 to 6 hours of physical exercise every single week, their hearts looked 20 years younger in terms of structure.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central to the protocol’s anti-aging effects is its impact on &lt;a href="https://www.icthealth.org/news/vo2max-from-a-smartwatch-is-it-a-new-longevity-biomarker" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.icthealth.org/news/vo2max-from-a-smartwatch-is-it-a-new-longevity-biomarker" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;VO2 max&lt;/a&gt;, the maximum amount of oxygen your body can utilize during exercise. &lt;a href="https://quatuormd.ca/en/vo2-max-not-just-for-athletes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://quatuormd.ca/en/vo2-max-not-just-for-athletes/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;Research consistently shows&lt;/a&gt; VO2 max as one of the strongest predictors of longevity and cardiovascular health.&lt;a href="https://icthealth.org/news/vo2max-from-a-smartwatch-is-it-a-new-longevity-biomarker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://icthealth.org/news/vo2max-from-a-smartwatch-is-it-a-new-longevity-biomarker" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2707428" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2707428" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;A major study published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; involving over 122,000 participants found individuals with the lowest VO2 max values had a fourfold increased risk of mortality compared to those with the highest values. Simply moving from the bottom 25th percentile to the 25th-50th percentile was associated with a 50% reduction in all-cause mortality.&lt;a href="https://peterattiamd.com/how-does-vo2-max-correlate-with-longevity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://peterattiamd.com/how-does-vo2-max-correlate-with-longevity/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="3"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Performing the exercise safely&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Patrick emphasized the Norweigan 4×4 protocol requires progressive implementation. “It’s not easy, you can’t just start doing it right out the gate,” she said. “You want to kind of work your way up to that… work your way up as you do it one week, two weeks, you know, a month later, two months later.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For business professionals seeking efficient health optimization, the Norwegian 4×4 protocol offers significant advantages. Its time-efficient nature, requiring less than an hour total including warm-up and cool-down, makes it practical for busy schedules while delivering outsized returns on investment in terms of cardiovascular health and longevity. And the research suggests this minimal time commitment could provide protection against heart failure, particularly the type known as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, which becomes increasingly common with age and sedentary lifestyle.&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29311053/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29311053/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the lab study, THC exposure led to a nine percent increase in rates of embryos containing an improper number of chromosomes, and more than doubled the rate of abnormalities in spindles, structures that assist in chromosomal development. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers caveated their results, noting that people undergoing IVF are taking large amounts of hormones, so their findings may not be generalizable to the larger public.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Samples used in the study came from females under the age of 40 and it is unclear as to when they consumed THC products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most chromosomally abnormal embryos will either fail to implant in the uterus or will result in miscarriage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In more rare instances, the abnormal embryos may result in chromosomal disorders, such as Down syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, exposing immature egg cells to THC disrupted their ability to sort chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An abnormality in the way an egg cell's chromosomes line up during cell division is linked with miscarriage and birth defects such as Edwards syndrome, which causes deadly growth delays, and Patau syndrome, which causes physical and developmental abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Autism Research Institute notes that previous research has also found that prenatal exposure to cannabis may increase likelihood of autism, with animal studies suggesting THC can lead to genetic mutations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, chromosomal abnormalities and defects are tied to autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These effects were seen in the recent study with people who had THC in their systems from marijuana products while they were pregnant or undergoing IVF.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Off the back of their investigation, the authors of the recent study conclude: 'These findings underscore the need for increased awareness and caution among people with ovaries, particularly those undergoing fertility treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our study highlights the importance of informing patients about the potential risks associated with cannabis consumption and provides a basis for regulatory bodies, medical professional societies, and public health organizations to establish recommendations and guidelines regarding cannabis consumption during fertility treatment.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63011-2#Sec2"&gt;were published&lt;/a&gt; in the medical journal, Nature Communications.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In the analysis of IVF patients, just 60 percent of embryos in the THC-positive group had the proper number of chromosomes, compared to 67 percent in the THC-negative group.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research has also looked at how marijuana can harm fertility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2023 study led by the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-2bdd3930-8e58-11f0-ac7c-e970e0b4e8cc"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, Irvine (UCI), found adolescent female mice exposed to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive chemical in the drug, had 50 percent fewer healthy ovarian follicles than the control group by the time they were adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers believe the body's endocannabinoid system - which is stimulated when marijuana is used - damages follicles or causes them to activate too quickly, depleting them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With marijuana use now commonplace among teens across America, researchers fear many young women are unknowingly damaging their likelihood of having a child in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the study was on mice, separate research has shown that pregnant women who use cannabis are at a greater risk of birth defects, miscarriages and stillbirths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other research has found that marijuana may damage semen quality and affect male fertility too&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a 2018 study out of Tulane and the University of Washington, researchers looked at samples from men in Washington, where the drug has been legal for recreational use since 2012, and compared it with their cannabis consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that men who had consumed cannabis in their lifetime were more likely to have abnormally-shaped sperm and lower concentrations of sperm compared to men who had never used the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 16:01:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxNb0hRYy1uNTNRVHVSMnBVX3pMY3ZMWHFiYmNTT2VyVGVFY3hJSGZUZ3RrTU5sRG5venF6aFlhNlRaZzFUYTZYSm5ObXhuZm9ZTnVFQnA4bWhRMkI2czdVR1BlR2psOURjZXBHaVFSSTlJVkRUQVV2THM3aDFBZHJnc000MktETkI2YnVYVDRvNmZuTE5YUGhMRzNONHhjX3ZtV3fSAacBQVVfeXFMTzI1QU9CZ01tR3d2OTQyeThKdTAzX2NlQi01QTJCUFNZcHdLV3E4MjdleWVWOVk2cnlvUEo3dEUwamNkWVRUbTk3V2dvQzFmNWZOc0JSVXhfOXVGb3F4RkNGZEV4S0NvTlZoMXduZGtqM2FPQmRXcVYxc0hYTDA5dnZpTlJqWDRrUDZJQWZST3A1SDVTQ3JvNXBEQWp0Wk8xdUM5MUZqZ2M</guid></item><item><title>杀死查理的天使明星Farrah Fawcett的“禁忌”癌症的新警报飙升-医生发现谁有风险-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15088799/women-cervical-anal-cancer-farrah-fawcett.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thousands of women could be offered screening for a little-discussed &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-9616f680-8f23-11f0-b861-4f2c49e4320e"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, after a major study revealed survivors of another cancer face elevated risks years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research focused on anal cancer, which remains rare but is rising fastest in older women – and found that those who have previously had cervical cancer are at significantly higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Current guidelines recommend screening for certain high-risk groups, including people with &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hiv_aids/index.html" id="mol-96191960-8f23-11f0-b861-4f2c49e4320e"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; and women with a history of vulvar cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But doctors say a crucial group is being overlooked, as cases of the disease continue to climb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rates are rising most sharply among women over 65, with cases in this age group increasing by around 4 per cent a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the most famous cases was American actress Farrah Fawcett – a 1970s TV icon best known for Charlie's Angels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She revealed her anal cancer diagnosis in 2006, which at the time sparked tabloid speculation about her sex life because of the stigma surrounding the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fawcett died in 2009, aged 62, after the cancer spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One of the most famous cases was American actress Farrah Fawcett – a 1970s TV icon best known for Charlie’s Angels (pictured with her long-term partner, actor Ryan O’Neal)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Fawcett revealed her cancer diagnosis in 2006, which at the time sparked tabloid speculation about her sex life.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the trend continues, oncologists at the US National Cancer Institute warn numbers could double in less than 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now researchers led by Dr Haluk Damgacioglu, an expert in disease modelling at the Medical University of South Carolina, say women who have survived cervical cancer should also be considered high risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In their study, more than 85,500 women diagnosed with cervical cancer between 1975 and 2021 were tracked for an average of nine years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those already diagnosed with anal cancer, or who developed it within two months of their cervical cancer diagnosis, were excluded from the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the remaining women, 64 went on to develop anal cancer – with risk climbing sharply 10 to 15 years after treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly 60 per cent of cases in women aged 65 to 74 occurred more than 15 years after their cervical cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The threshold currently used to justify screening programmes is 17 cases per 100,000 people. In this age group, the study found rates of 17.6 per 100,000 – high enough to qualify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the journal JAMA Network Open, Dr Damgacioglu said: 'These findings support the need for age-based and duration-based anal cancer screening recommendations for women with a cervical cancer history.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;HPV is thought to be behind at least 90 per cent of anal cancers and 99 per cent of cervical cancers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'In summary, this study provides critical data to inform anal cancer screening recommendations among a high-risk population of women with a history of cervical cancer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team is now calling for further research to weigh up the risks and benefits of screening, and to determine the best age to introduce it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cervical cancer itself remains a major killer, with around two women dying from it every day in the UK. It is often dubbed a 'silent killer' because symptoms can be mistaken for less serious problems such as period pain and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If caught early, the chance of surviving at least five years after an anal cancer diagnosis is around 95 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But this plummets to just 15 per cent if the disease is detected late, once it has spread to other parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, women aged 25 to 49 are invited for cervical screening – more commonly known as a smear test – at their GP surgery every three years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet uptake remains low, with only about 70 per cent of eligible women, or 4.6million, attending their scheduled test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 1,600 people are diagnosed with anal cancer in the UK every year, the majority of them women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Desperate Housewives star Marcia Cross was famously diagnosed with anal cancer in 2017, which she attributes to a strain of HPV that may have also caused her husband's throat cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the most high-profile cases in the US was Desperate Housewives actress Marcia Cross, who revealed her diagnosis in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common symptoms include bleeding from the anus, pain in or around the area, small lumps felt around the anus, changes in bowel habits, and passing mucus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These issues can also be caused by more common conditions such as haemorrhoids or anal fissures – but persistent or unusual symptoms should always be checked by a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both cervical and anal cancers are linked to infection with high-risk strains of human papillomavirus (HPV), which is transmitted through sexual contact. More than 90 per cent of cases are thought to be caused by HPV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are more than 100 types of HPV, and only around 30 can affect the genital area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many people never show symptoms, and the majority of cases go away without treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, in some cases it can cause tissue to grow abnormally, resulting over many years in cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The warning comes as health chiefs are urging under-25s who left school without receiving a life-saving cancer vaccine to come forward for the jab.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It's a crisis, and cases are multiplying.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ebola is spread by contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person, as well as contact with contaminated objects or infected animals such as bats or primates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pain and weakness, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain and unexplained bleeding or bruising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ebola can cause serious disease and has a mortality rate as high as 90 percent without treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are currently two FDA-approved treatments for Ebola: Inmazeb and Ebanga. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is also an FDA-approved vaccine for the disease but it is not available to the public and only given to people responding to outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first confirmed case in the DRC, according to the WHO, was a pregnant woman who went to Bulape General Reference Hospital on August 20 with a high fever, bloody stool, excessive bleeding and weakness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She died five days later from organ failure and testing on September 4 confirmed Ebola.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, another outbreak was declared in Uganda, with 12 confirmed cases and two probable, as well as four deaths. The outbreak was declared over in April. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The outbreak was declared over the Sudan Virus, a rare virus that causes a severe form of Ebola hemorrhagic fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with the typical Ebola symptoms, it also causes bleeding from the eyes, nose, gums and other body parts, organ failure and death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;New York officials suspected two patients at a Manhattan urgent care may have had Ebola earlier this year because the patients had recently traveled from Uganda where there was an outbreak of the disease at the time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Images showed first responders wore face coverings and gloves as they moved the patients into ambulances&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no specific cure or treatment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The largest Ebola outbreak occurred in 2014 to 2016 in West Africa when more than 28,600 cases were reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In February of this year, two suspected Ebola cases were detected in the US. Patients were transported from a New York City urgent care to a hospital after they exhibited symptoms of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials suspected they could have had Ebola infections because the patients had recently traveled from Uganda where an outbreak was ongoing at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was later confirmed that they did not have Ebola, but it was not revealed what illness they were suffering from. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first person to have a confirmed Ebola infection in the US was a man from Liberia in 2014. He had traveled to the US where he began experiencing Ebola-like symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After tests confirmed the illness on September 30, 2014, he became the first US patient to have the disease. He died a week later.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Now, new research suggests that the specific timing of eating breakfast and other meals might be pretty important as well, especially as you get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs43856-025-01035-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffood-nutrition%2Fa66043546%2Feating-breakfast-late-dangerous-for-health-study%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:decades-long study;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;decades-long study&lt;/a&gt; from researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital and the University of Manchester followed nearly 3,000 adults ages 42 to 94 for an average of 22 years. The team tracked participants’ meal times, lifestyle factors, genetic data, and health outcomes to see how eating schedules shifted with age, as well as what those shifts meant for long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they found is that as participants got older, they tended to eat their meals later in the day. The time frame in which all meals were consumed each day also narrowed. But perhaps the most important outcome of the study was discovering that eating breakfast later was linked to a higher risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in the early-eating group had a 10-year-survival rate of nearly 90%, compared to roughly 87% for those among the late eaters. Moreover, each additional hour of delay in breakfast was associated with an 8-11% higher risk of mortality, depending on the statistical model, even after accounting for factors like age, sex, and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why mealtimes may shift&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that the reasons for participants eating breakfast later were sometimes tied to health challenges. Older adults with fatigue, depression, anxiety, and multiple chronic illnesses were more likely to eat later. Difficulties preparing food and poor sleep quality also factored into delays, as did genetic predisposition to stay up late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the study was observational, this might matter quite a lot. It’s entirely possible that the increased mortality rate in late eaters is connected to the underlying health or genetic issues they faced, and which also caused them to delay their meals. In other words, although there’s a correlation between meal delays and a higher risk of mortality, this study doesn’t prove that the delay itself is the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that the study centered mostly around white British adults and relied on self-reported meal times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should you eat breakfast early?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, all of this does suggest that keeping mealtimes consistent—especially starting the day with breakfast on the earlier side—could be a marker of better overall health in older adults. Shifts in meal time might not only reflect underlying health problems but could also influence circadian rhythms, which help regulate things like sleep and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though more research is needed, keeping a consistent breakfast routine could be one simple step toward supporting healthier aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 12:45:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQVDNKRzlucnVmNjBva19pR1BjS3ExRTB6dmotM3BqNVNyMWg0YzI5N3JtdG5qQzRVemxwOUw4Z0gzX01aeHRNT0lNMzc3b1ljaXRxWlJMRDRfdkE5MHhyaGdGeDcya1VuQzZGS0haV3MwendoUllQRXpLcEk3aF8tcTU1OEM</guid></item><item><title>一项新的研究显示，单次运动可能会减缓癌细胞的生长-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/09/11/exercise-cancer-benefits-prevention-recurrence/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QYKJEJKTLNBRTEPDKY2CIZKWSE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Exercising muscles pumps out substances that can suppress&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the growth of breast cancer cells, according to an important new study of exercise and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IJRARYDOWVETDGV4IB7IIXU2KA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40608178/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published last month, involved 32 women who’d survived breast cancer.

Discover why they should be avoided and which healthy practices you should turn to instead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c94685" class="body-graf"&gt;The liver is a remarkable organ. Among its many functions, it rids our blood of toxins, disposes of old cells, metabolizes nutrients and creates the fluid necessary for digestion. And it rarely needs assistance with any of its hundreds of jobs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-57db7c" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, a host of cleanses and supplements are available online and in stores, with claims they can detoxify the liver, thereby improving its function. But there’s no clinical evidence to support that they work, Dr. Raymond Chung, chief of gastroenterology, hepatology and endoscopy at Mass General Brigham, tells TODAY.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3a2597" class="body-graf"&gt;In fact, some have been linked to liver damage and failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-449556" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never Have I Ever: Done a Liver Cleanse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-537b2d" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s only natural to think that being good to our bodies is to find things like supplements that ostensibly reduce the stress to our livers,” Chung tells TODAY.com. But your liver likely doesn’t need any additional help, which is why he’s never done a liver cleanse or taken a liver supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-de45b3" class="body-graf"&gt;Plus, he has safety concerns around the many products that are available. That's in part because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't vet the safety of dietary supplements before they hit shelves (though it can take action against supplement makers after if a dangerous one reaches the market).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b62db8" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/bad-supplements-list-rcna209561" target="_blank"&gt;Certain types of supplements can be especially risky&lt;/a&gt; to liver health, such as black cohosh, kava and vitamin A, TODAY.com previously reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-ac8263" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-056ce5" class="body-graf"&gt;While the liver can incur damage from disease, viruses and lifestyle choices, a detox likely won’t be the fix — and in some cases, they may even make things worse. “Several herbal and dietary supplements have been linked to liver injury, damage or even liver failure,” Chung points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aa4bd9" class="body-graf"&gt;“The liver is the ultimate filter and the ultimate detoxifier,” he adds, but taking supplements can actually “overwhelm that detoxification mechanism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-8a7bec" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to Do Instead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d1cb86" class="body-graf"&gt;If you’ve already taken liver cleanses and supplements, don’t fret. “(The liver) is a sturdy, hardy organ,” with regenerative capacities, says Chung. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-25aec0" class="body-graf"&gt;To keep it functioning at its best, avoid liver supplements and focus on a few lifestyle practices, he advises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-44d9cf" class="body-graf"&gt;“The good news about the liver is that it is such an extraordinarily forgiving organ,” says Chung. “So even if liver damage somehow occurred during the period of exposure to a supplement, in most cases, with removal of the injurious agent, we will see regression of that injury.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b32468" class="body-graf"&gt;Moving forward, focus on a healthy diet. Chung recommends the &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/mediterranean-diet-rcna63362"&gt;Mediterranean diet,&lt;/a&gt; which promotes healthy fats, lean protein, antioxidants, whole grains and produce. This diet has been shown to lower the risk of death, lower levels of heart disease and boost digestive health. Chung is a fan because it lessens the accumulation of fat in the liver — a benefit since &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/fatty-liver-diet-rcna140012"&gt;non-alcoholic fatty liver disease&lt;/a&gt; is the leading cause of liver cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-49cb36" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;He also advises fitting as much movement as you can into your day, and drinking alcohol in moderation, especially if you have liver disease, since it can inflame the liver and destroy its cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQcTYwRzJRS3pWRHRkVXZ1cUF1UER6eXJoZHQtMW1UNHhHUHEyQjk2ZUtpeWZ0cWRVOGJWUmNkeWRBcWNGUGdLdXkyc1E1N24yVFFKVlYtMG01Q1JtWUxsVndqLXBfQzJxUVlJZEpXRmxhRHNRX0ktZW9wT1N2OWdjU1hORjBLazZ5eWxUWGRYc2JMUlpQS1M3M21td9IBVEFVX3lxTE9DVXFyU2RFUS0xeHBlZWxRQmdrdXYwTF9LM1Q3VWFUWjdiNVhFQ284MWNZWE5saWpib1V6S2k1LU80aTBtaWh5N0hXcmoxT0VEallhYg</guid></item><item><title>希腊酸奶有多健康？ -《西雅图时报》</title><link>https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/how-healthy-is-greek-yogurt/</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE45UXQ4ZUNVZFNLS1F5SWVjQmxYMGkyNkRhSEFPQzJwbkhyYms1THFENGpST1hxaTRqYkN0VVZ0bjlQRHJrVEtoUzhiVjA0dXlpTFV0Nl8taUNBMnNXMXloUjZpUU11TGNtWmF6ZDNBaVRzN0hnZ1RlVzRB?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;How healthy is Greek yogurt?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 11:22:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE45UXQ4ZUNVZFNLS1F5SWVjQmxYMGkyNkRhSEFPQzJwbkhyYms1THFENGpST1hxaTRqYkN0VVZ0bjlQRHJrVEtoUzhiVjA0dXlpTFV0Nl8taUNBMnNXMXloUjZpUU11TGNtWmF6ZDNBaVRzN0hnZ1RlVzRB</guid></item><item><title>爱情、毒品和安全套：艾滋病毒感染者身份不同的夫妇面临新的现实-美国国家公共广播电台</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/09/11/g-s1-77007/hiv-condoms-hiv-positive-u-s-aid-cuts</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                Robert Ochweda and Millicent Akoth is HIV positive — she caught the virus from her former husband. She is now married to Robert Ochweda, a fisherman who is HIV negative. After the two of them fell in love, he says he was afraid to marry her lest he contract the virus. "I have been able to stay safe by using condoms and PrEP," Ochweda explains, referring to a pill that prevents infection. In the wake of U.S. foreign aid cuts, they say it's become harder to find the pills and condoms that keep them safe.

   &lt;p&gt;Let's say you fall in love with someone harboring a deadly -- and highly infectious -- virus. And you think … is it crazy to get married?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sometimes love conquers all — with the help of modern medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's the story of serodiscordant couples — the term used when one partner is HIV positive and the other is HIV negative.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Robert Ochweda and Millicent Akoth of Kenya are one such couple. She is HIV positive — she caught the virus from her former husband. He is a fisherman who is HIV negative. After the two of them fell in love, he says he was afraid to marry her lest he contract the virus.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;He was able to overcome his fears.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I have been able to stay safe by using condoms and PrEP," Ochweda explains, referring to a pill that prevents infection. And The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention writes: "Most condoms are highly effective in preventing HIV."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;His wife takes antiretroviral pills that reduce her viral load, so she does not face the risk of death from AIDS. Those pills also reduce the risk that she will infect her husband.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This year, couples in this category are especially anxious. They say that, in the wake of the Trump administration's dramatic foreign aid cuts and dismantling of USAID, the agency that supported health-related programs, it's become harder to find the pills and condoms that keep them safe.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-82272" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Caleb Ochieng, who is HIV negative, has been married to DIana Odhiambo, who is HIV positive, for eight years. They have two children. On a recent visit to pick up his PrEP drugs that reduce his risk of infection, he says, "I was told the supply that was available has been reserved for pregnant women."

   &lt;p&gt;Caleb Ochieng, who is HIV negative, has been married to Diana Odhiambo, who is HIV positive, for eight years. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ochieng learned of Odhiambo's HIV status when they went to do an HIV test as they made plans to tie the knot after several years of cohabiting. She believes she contracted the disease from a previous relationship.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We were shocked because at that time we had two children and wanted others. We were advised on preventive measures like condom use and voluntary male circumcision as a way of preventing HIV infection," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I wondered how we would manage," he recalls. "It's not been easy but with love, we have been taking care of ourselves." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Odhiambo takes pills to suppress the virus; he takes pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to stay safe. He is tested for HIV every three months. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Taking these precautions, the couple has had two children who are HIV negative. After counseling, Odhiambo has become a peer educator who talks to other couples in the same situation.  The partner who is positive, he reflects, "has a lot of emotions. AS a partner, you should be there for them and support them well."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On a recent visit to the clinic where he picks up his PrEP drugs, he says, "I was told the supply that was available has been reserved for pregnant women. I traveled to neighboring Busia county and managed to get a small dose that could last a month and a half."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;His experience echoes a memo from the State Department that NPR obtained, stating that if a clinic receives funding through the U.S. program PEPFAR, this preventative medication can "only" be given to "pregnant and breastfeeding women" during the 90-day freeze on foreign aid that the Trump administration instituted — and that is still in effect.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A senior health official with the Kenyan Ministry of Health told NPR that clinics have been rationing medications and other supplies because of the uncertainties about donor funds.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We acquire most of the HIV medication through partners and donors. The exit of U.S. funding means that there is a gap, and until that gap is filled, there is always bound to be friction but the government has done everything to keep operations going," says the official, who asked not to be identified by name because he did not have permission to speak to the press.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Joywine Adek, a programs officer at &lt;a href="https://www.mildmay.org/kenya" target="_blank"&gt;Mildmay Kenya&lt;/a&gt;, an organization that supports HIV patients, is seeing this gap.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mildmay Kenya is among the organizations that was receiving funding from the U.S. government to support HIV interventions in Kenya, including screening services, distribution of antiretroviral drugs and condoms, and counseling for serodiscordant couples.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"In the current grant that is available after the reduction in funding, there is no support for discordant couples," Adek says, adding that the charity has had to halt many of its services because of the loss of U.S. aid.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We are trying to sort this out by doing what we call integration of HIV care into routine health care," says Fredrick Oluoch, the director of public health in Kenya's Kisumu County.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The lack of condoms is evident. This reporter saw empty dispensers where co Kndoms were once stocked and made available in clinics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-82267" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Empty condom dispensers at a charity called Mildmay Kenya, which supports people who are HIV positive. According to the United Nations Population Fund, the U.S. cuts in foreign aid have had an impact on the supply of free condoms for those in need.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;And even though condoms are inexpensive — as little as $1 or $2 each in the U.S., even less in Kenya — that price could still be daunting in a country where a third of the population lives below the poverty line of about $2 a day in income.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kenya has previously reported that the supply of condoms was not equal to the demand. But this year, officials say, things are worse than ever in the wake of the U.S. foreign aid shakeup, which has affected some of the suppliers, like the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a statement to NPR, UNFPA noted: "Kenya has historically relied heavily on USAID for its free condom distribution programs. Kenya's annual condom requirement is estimated at 400–450 million units. Condom procurement by UNFPA has been affected indirectly — but nonetheless significantly - by U.S. funding cuts. While UNFPA continues its role in condom programming through funding from other global partners, the U.S. stop work order has contributed to shortfalls in supply, putting more pressure on UNFPA and other providers. Some 9.8 million UNFPA-procured condoms were received at the Kenya Central Stores on August 13, 2025, but funding restrictions from the U.S. and other donors mean there is uncertainty as to whether UNFPA will be able to meet projected condom procurement needs for 2026 and beyond."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;NPR asked the State Department to respond to these points about U.S. funding and free condom programs but did not receive a response.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The result of this altered aid landscape is that partners with different HIV status are living with newfound uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-82273" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                "The shortage of the drugs and condoms is a major concern for us, and the government is yet to address our concerns," says Erastus Ng'uono, who is HIV positive and married to Winnie Auma Miyare, who is HIV negative. The couple is standing in front of their home with two of their children, a boy named Rain and a baby girl named Rose. Says Ng'uono: "I don't know what the future holds."

   &lt;p&gt;Erastus Ng'uono was born with HIV positive status. When he met Winnie Auma Miyare and wanted to start a relationship with her, he asked her if she could love someone who is HIV positive and using ARVs. A few days later, he told her about his HIV status. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At first she did not want to have anything to do with him. But when he explained how medications could help her ward off infection, she changed her mind. She takes PrEP pills. They have four children who are all HIV negative. Their youngest is six months old. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The news of U.S. aid cuts that could affect the strategies they use has hit them hard. "I encouraged him to have courage and not to worry," she says. "I know the government will intervene." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I was very afraid," he says. "I even prayed over it and I know God will see us through."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still he worries. "The shortage of the drugs and condoms is a major concern for us and the government is yet to address our concerns," says Ng'uono.

It is manifestly clear that people who would like the Covid vaccine are not able to access it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Changing the rules to make vaccination easier will depend on the state, said Lindsay Wiley, a professor of law and faculty director of the health law and policy program at UCLA Law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“In several states, governors and health officials are solving the prescription problem pretty swiftly, so it’s a rapidly evolving situation right now. In other states, the legislature may need to take action to fix the problem,” Wiley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Even states that have tried to combat the confusion still have vaccine challenges. The state of Maryland released &lt;a href="https://governor.maryland.gov/news/press/pages/Maryland-Protects-Access-to-Vaccines-for-All-Marylanders.aspx" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt; last week for all residents to access vaccines – without specifying the need to disclose qualifying conditions. Maryland’s governor, Wes Moore, called the federal changes to vaccine policy “harmful for Marylanders and all Americans”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet when Ian Morgan tried to obtain the vaccine in Maryland, the pharmacist said it could only be administered to those over the age of 65 or people with at least one underlying health condition. Morgan tried to make an appointment online, but was told CVS couldn’t schedule his appointment because he did not qualify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Morgan, a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institutes of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and a union steward of NIH Fellows United-UAW 2750, said the tumult has been caused by Kennedy’s messaging on vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I think the chaos is the point, and that chaos has consequences,” Morgan said. “Creating this confusion, creating this chaos, trying to discredit scientific experts – and we see that every time [Kennedy] goes out there – that in and of itself is causing problems, and that in itself is harming the American people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f1f7cf35-b4f9-47ab-aad7-e55e9cb97247" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Workers log a shipment of Covid vaccines in Horsham, Pennsylvania.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Matt Rourke/AP&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Morgan is one of 1,000 current and former HHS employees who signed a &lt;a href="https://www.savehhs.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; calling for Kennedy’s resignation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Vaccine availability for children, especially for those under the age of five, has lagged even further behind adults as pediatricians struggle to understand new limitations and potential legal risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Joanne Hilden, a retired physician, has been searching for the updated vaccines for her four grandchildren, who are between the ages three and 12, in Minnesota. The local health department, where the youngest two kids were vaccinated in 2021, is only offering vaccines for adults over the age of 65. Pharmacies have not received the pediatric doses yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There are also immense structural barriers that make it harder for marginalized people to access the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Julia Lynch, a professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania, first made plans to get vaccinated in Oakland, New Jersey, a 45-minute drive from her home in Philadelphia, before the state board of pharmacy gave pharmacies the go-ahead to vaccinate Pennsylvanians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CVS pharmacies near her home had no appointments, so she ended up driving to a predominantly white suburb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I don’t know why it is that the vaccines are getting to those CVSes first,” she said. But that means “if you’re Black or Latino, you are less likely than if you’re white to live close to someplace where you can get a vaccine”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-27" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-rsfwa"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;This Week in Trumpland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"the-stakes-us-election-edition","successDescription":"A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Traveling to Oakland by public transit would have taken more than two hours on three buses and one regional train.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Eligibility right now is obviously limited to people who are over 65 or who have at least one medical condition that puts them at high risk,” Lynch said. “These are exactly the people who are most likely to have trouble traveling four-plus hours on a multimodal public transit journey to get their Covid shot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Not everyone has reliable internet access, the technological knowledge to book appointments, or the ability to take time off work or find childcare to locate and travel to appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“For people who are not chronically online, it’s a major undertaking to do all this,” Lynch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Fighting to have the shots covered by insurance, or paying out of pocket for the uninsured, is another major hurdle, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Rachel, who lives in Pittsburgh and asked to be identified by her first name to protect her health history, has two autoimmune disorders and a genetic blood clotting disorder that puts her at high risk if she gets sick with Covid. She said she would like to get the latest Covid shot, but is planning to wait for a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The challenges right now for me are just around information, and actually knowing what is the truth and what is going to happen if I try to get it,” she said. She said she had heard of people being turned away from pharmacies even after the Pennsylvania vaccine announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It just sounds like it’s still a shitshow. It’s still challenging to make an appointment here, so I’m going to wait a little bit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Rachel said it reminded her of 2021, when many people scrambled to get their first Covid shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s just frustrating to me that based on absolutely zero evidence, and in some cases, just making up lies about evidence, [the] HHS has just decided these are so dangerous that we need to limit them,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sarah, who lives in Westchester county, New York, and asked to be identified by her first name so she is not harassed by anti-vaccine activists, said she was finally able to get the shot after days of effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In New York, she needed a prescription. That later changed when Kathy Hochul, the governor, &lt;a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-signs-executive-order-expanding-access-vaccines-amid-uncertainty-washington" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;opened&lt;/a&gt; up access to all New Yorkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The faxed prescription never went through, so her health system had to set up an electronic prescription system. Sarah asked that her doctor prescribe any Covid vaccine; she said she overheard the pharmacist denying one prescription because it was for the Pfizer vaccine and they only had Moderna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Even after the prescription was received, the pharmacist said he needed verbal confirmation from the doctor by phone as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sarah said she paid $250 out of pocket, and has since spent hours on the phone with her insurance company to be reimbursed. After she paid, the pharmacist tried to dissuade her from getting the shot, Sarah said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Do you really know what you’re getting into? This is brand new,” she recalls him saying. She responded: “I know – that’s why I want it.” But he told her they “don’t know anything” about the updated vaccines and “we don’t know what’s gonna happen” to her once she received it, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The roadblocks were “wearing me down”, Sarah said. “It’s trying to make it inaccessible, impossible, confusing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Shipman in North Carolina was dogged in his search, even looking at appointments in other states. Eventually, he was able to receive the vaccine at an urgent care center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But not everyone is able to track down the vaccine and overcome these obstacles, Lynch said. “It’s really hard for ordinary people who are very busy and not necessarily paying close attention to this to know what they’re supposed to do to keep themselves or their loved ones safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 10:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE5aenlhSG9hSV8zOW5oSWpzUmdXZW9xeGxnRWowV0dieGRicEY0NXhfMk01aEdfSUxqLXVqTUtrXzh1Y2hRWmlEbUs2a2lKaGpVRGJVSDdRTXZQY2JPYlRjcEdkSTlPdnJVVDlwa01fM09URGRhQlRna0NnaDc</guid></item><item><title>您在成长过程中是否感到迷茫？越来越多的女性发现这是多动症-今日美国</title><link>https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2025/09/11/adhd-in-women-girls-book-carla-ciccone/86073333007/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.carlaciccone.com/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Carla Ciccone&lt;/a&gt; gave birth to her daughter, she spiraled with shame and self-hatred. She felt lost. She felt like a fraud. Part of her had always felt an aching imposter syndrome and a difficulty controlling her emotions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She knew she needed therapy. What she didn’t expect was an &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/10/13/what-is-adhd/71127137007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;ADHD diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She thought back to the boys of her elementary school days, bouncing in their seats and unable to keep still. But that didn’t describe her at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ciccone examined the criticism she faced throughout her life from teachers and family members who told her she was lazy, careless and gave up too easily, she writes in her new book &lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/735723/nowhere-girl-by-carla-ciccone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;“Nowhere Girl: Life as a Member of ADHD’s Lost Generation”&lt;/a&gt; (out now from The Dial Press).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/10/USAT/86073434007-carla-ciccone-credit-jenna-wakani.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=450&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt="Carla Ciccone is the author of &amp;quot;Nowhere Girl: Life as a Member of ADHD's Lost Generation.&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Carla Ciccone is the author of &amp;quot;Nowhere Girl: Life as a Member of ADHD's Lost Generation.&amp;quot;" data-c-credit="Jenna Wakani"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Hyperactive ADHD – the more commonly studied type – is only one part of the story. Inattentive ADHD, on the other hand, is driven by difficulty sustaining attention and focus rather than impulsivity or need for constant movement. Think daydreamers. It’s &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7561166/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;more common in women&lt;/a&gt; than in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ciccone isn’t alone. In 2023, a study published in Epic Research found the &lt;a href="https://www.epicresearch.org/articles/stimulant-prescribing-rates-remain-steady-for-patients-with-adhd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;number of newly diagnosed women&lt;/a&gt; between ages 23-29 and 30-49 nearly doubled from 2020 to 2022. As Ciccone argues in her book, a lack of comprehensive research and attention to ADHD in women and girls has created a “lost generation” she dubs the “Nowhere Girls.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Meet the ‘big, chaotic sisterhood’ of girls left out of ADHD research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Once diagnosed, Ciccone craved answers. She undertook a personal and academic deep dive to discover why so many women grew up undiagnosed. She interviewed those who had been diagnosed later in life, many only after their children were diagnosed with the genetic disorder. She wanted an explanation for all the times she felt she was doing “life” wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.additudemag.com/3-types-of-adhd/?srsltid=AfmBOors5MNHNFcP-dxh3cKBUF-TPyNA5n1wz5YYX_ubQmlPF4j2aRrm" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Symptoms of inattentive ADHD&lt;/a&gt; include inability to sustain attention during tasks, mind wandering, careless mistakes, losing things, easily distracted by external stimuli or unrelated thoughts and forgetfulness, according to &lt;a href="https://www.additudemag.com/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;ADHD Magazine ADDitude&lt;/a&gt;. People with it can get overstimulated easily and sometimes struggle to control their emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Although the word &lt;em&gt;inattentive&lt;/em&gt; implies a lack of attention, it’s a misnomer,” Ciccone writes. “People with inattentive ADHD can pay attention, and if something is of special interest to us, we display intense focus, but we lack the internal regulation required to make decisions about how and when to deploy our attention.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;While ADHD diagnoses are rising, it’s not just because more people have ADHD. Part of the reason is that professionals are getting better at recognizing symptoms. In the past, the general thinking was that girls couldn’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; ADHD and they were misdiagnosed in adolescence with anxiety or depression. Black women, especially, are &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/black-women-bias-adhd-diagnosis/2021/07/16/1784cda2-df22-11eb-9f54-7eee10b5fcd2_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;under- and misdiagnosed&lt;/a&gt; compared to their white male peers, the Washington Post reported in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ciccone was frustrated to find research was largely focused on boys. She eventually found &lt;a href="https://psychology.berkeley.edu/people/stephen-hinshaw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Stephen Hinshaw&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at UC Berkley and one of the leading researchers on ADHD in women and girls, who is trying to change that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Sadly, it's a common story in the medical field that women and girls get overlooked until it's too late,” Ciccone tells USA TODAY. “Then they go, ‘Oops, I guess you better study you. I guess your bodies work differently.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Gender can play a big role in ADHD diagnosis. “Gendered socialization” – the ways we internalize societal expectations from a young age (like dolls and trucks at playtime) – puts girls with undiagnosed ADHD at a disadvantage. There’s pressure to be a quiet, polite girl. As Ciccone writes in the book, “emotional dysregulation becomes especially tricky because we become more and more beholden to gender expectations that say it’s inappropriate to display intense feelings.” Sometimes, they’re identified as “gifted” kids and are often perfectionists. They may appear to be listening, even if they aren’t. They’re often given more responsibility in the classroom than their male counterparts. They learn to mask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/10/USAT/86073452007-9780593729519.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=448&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt='"Nowhere Girl" is out now from the Dial Press at Penguin Random House.'&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption='"Nowhere Girl" is out now from the Dial Press at Penguin Random House.' data-c-credit="Penguin Random House"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“In elementary school in the ‘90s, boys were expected to act out to a certain degree and be aggressive and loud and disruptive. And that’s not to say that they had a good experience of that, they still get corrected. But if a girl does it, she gets corrected in a different way, in a way that goes (at) her self-esteem,” Ciccone says. “‘You’re a girl, and you’re supposed to be good.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;They learn coping mechanisms to skate by schooling “at the cost of a lot of anxiety and a lot of stress,” Hinshaw told Ciccone for “Nowhere Girl.” Those skills (and supportive families, if they have them) can act as scaffolding against exacerbated ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/adhd-what-you-need-to-know" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Inattentive symptoms typically persist with age&lt;/a&gt;, while hyperactive ADHD symptoms often decline, according to the National Institutes of Health. So when that scaffolding falls away – with larger class loads in high school or college, in their first professional job, after having a baby – it all comes crashing down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Carla Ciccone's ADHD diagnosis gave her a ‘reason to forgive’ herself&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When the pandemic wreaked havoc on the world, “we lost our support," Ciccone says. "ADHD people, we can be chaotic but we do sort of thrive when we have a routine. And so when we lost that, I think a lot of us were just alone with our brains.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But the pandemic also opened up different avenues for support, like telehealth. Ciccone found success with online therapy. Once she got her diagnosis, it led to a chapter of reflection and, ultimately, forgiveness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“The emotional dysregulation that leads to this sense of shame that is really persistent and really, really hard to shake, even when you do know where it’s stemming from … it’s very hard to get away from that,” Ciccone says. Many of the women she spoke with felt overwhelmed, like she had, which led to a feeling of "I can’t handle life the way that other people can and therefore I’m not worthy of my position in the world.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ciccone began to give herself grace for the things she used to hate about herself.

For decades, the treatment was mainly palliative. Patients would take a heaping amount of drugs to improve their breathing and ability to process food. Some used devices to inhale medicated mist or create sound waves to loosen mucus in their lungs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Trikafta, which was developed at Vertex’s San Diego laboratory and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2019, focuses on repairing the mucus proteins as they form in the cell, as opposed to most prior research, which sought to treat the disease by changing the defective gene, the foundation said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The lesson here is to understand the cause of the disease and go right at it,” Negulescu said. “It might take longer and be more difficult, but this is proof that it works.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Globally, two-thirds of people diagnosed with CF are being treated with the Vertex drug, according to the company. But &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38558542/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38558542/"&gt;many in low- and middle-income countries&lt;/a&gt; can’t afford the drug due to its hefty price tag of $300,000 a year, which is paid for primarily by private insurers and reimbursement agreements in rich countries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vrtx.com/medicines/cystic-fibrosis-facts-and-figures/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.vrtx.com/medicines/cystic-fibrosis-facts-and-figures/"&gt;The company said&lt;/a&gt; it recognized accessibility challenges and has established a pilot donation program to provide CF medication to eligible people. The program is now available in 14 countries. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Our goal is that everyone with CF has effective medication,” Negulescu said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;While continuing research on CF, Negulescu and the Vertex team are also developing nonopioid pain therapeutics. In January, the FDA approved Vertex’s medication for moderate to acute pain, Journavx, which was released to the market in March. As of mid-July, more than 110,000 prescriptions were filled across the country, according to the company. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

A vaccine had been available since 1982 and recommended for those deemed to be at highest risk, such as health care workers and men who have sex with men. But the infection rates had gone up, not down. When epidemiologists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dug into the data, they noticed one figure that had stayed alarmingly stable: Between 30% and 40% of hepatitis B patients had no identifiable risk factors at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When they published &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/380888" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;their paper&lt;/a&gt; in 1990, it was subtitled, “Need for Alternative Vaccination Strategies.” The next year, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices — the CDC body that sets such guidelines — recommended vaccinating all infants. Over the next two decades, case numbers &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00333549231175548" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;plummeted&lt;/a&gt; by 99% among children and teens. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, under the Trump administration, some members of the ACIP have hinted at a desire to reverse course when the committee &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;next&lt;/a&gt; convenes on Sept. 18 and 19, as part of a broader review of childhood vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the last meeting in June, after health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. abruptly &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/09/rfk-jr-fires-every-member-of-cdc-vaccine-expert-panel-acip/"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; all 17 experts who sat on the committee and &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/11/rfk-jr-names-new-acip-members-replaces-cdc-vaccine-experts-he-just-fired/"&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; them with his own picks, the new chair, Martin Kulldorff, expressed doubts about the current advice. “Is it wise to administer a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine to every newborn before leaving the hospital? That’s the question,” he said. “Unless the mother is hepatitis B positive, an argument could be made to delay the vaccine for this infection, which is primarily spread by sexual activity and intravenous drug use.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To people who study, treat, or have hepatitis B, that argument is dangerously misguided, and if adopted, they warn it could lead to a resurgence of the virus as well as the liver disease and cancer it causes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m speechless. It’s a failure to recognize why that strategy was put into place,” said Miriam Alter, the first author of that 1990 study, now retired from the CDC and the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. If that argument is taken up by the committee, she went on, “the virus, because it still circulates in the population, will rear its ugly head. We’ll be back in the same situation we were in when we depended upon risk-factor-based screening.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;One reason for giving the first vaccine dose on the first day of life, and the next doses soon after, is that infants are exquisitely vulnerable. A newly minted immune system — still learning what’s foreign and what’s self, not yet able to muster certain protective white blood cells — can allow hepatitis B to run amok, replicating continuously. That &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/12/4/439" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;happens&lt;/a&gt; to fewer than 10% of people who get infected as adults, to 30% of those who get infected between the ages of 1 and 4, and to a whopping 90% of babies who get infected in the first year. If they’re vaccinated, though, that rate nosedives into the single digits. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What you need to do is get their bodies the tools they need for the babies to start fighting the virus as soon as they are exposed,” said Chari Cohen, president of the Hepatitis B Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That exposure can take place before an infant has fully entered the world. Hepatitis B is a blood-borne pathogen, and childbirth, be it vaginal or cesarean, is bloody, with a possibility of mother-to-child transmission. While Sen. Rand Paul (R.-Ky.) &lt;a href="https://x.com/RandPaul/status/1962223758896173407" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recently claimed on X&lt;/a&gt; that there is “no medical need to give newborns Hep B vaccine if mother is not infected” because “all mothers who deliver in a hospital are tested,” he was quickly corrected by his Senate colleague Bill Cassidy (R.-La.), who &lt;a href="https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/1962269409642197050" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;posted, “Empirically, this is not true.&lt;/a&gt; Not all mothers have prenatal care. Some get infected between testing in the first trimester and delivery. In some cases, the test is overlooked.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If infection occurs at birth, there’s a 24-hour window of opportunity. “The vaccine needs to be given immediately to help the newborn develop antibodies to fight off that infection they have just been exposed to,” said John Ward, director of the Coalition for Global Hepatitis Elimination, who led the CDC’s viral hepatitis division from 2005 to 2018. “The longer you wait, then the longer that virus has time to set up shop and resist those antibodies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But early immunization isn’t only helpful in cases of maternal infection. Hepatitis B is extremely infectious, some 50-to-100 times more easily transmissible than HIV, with more of it typically present in blood, meaning that a smaller speck may suffice for the pathogen to be passed on. Su Wang, a New Jersey physician specializing in hepatitis B, has seen young people with so much virus per milliliter of blood that “the lab test couldn’t even quantify it,” and technicians had to dilute the specimen in order to get a read. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means that a child’s risk doesn’t end once they come home from the hospital: Transmission can happen in the household or at day care, in the infinitesimal-seeming blood exposure that might stem from a razor nick or shared toothbrush, a bite or scratch from another kid. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Wang is a case in point. She was diagnosed with hepatitis B in her first year of college, when she signed up to donate blood, and she assumed she’d gotten it from her mom. But when her mom got tested, it came back negative. Her maternal grandparents, on the other hand, tested positive. They’d lived with Wang’s family when she was little, and Wang imagines that they may have been her source of exposure, but can’t be sure. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those cases of early-childhood transmission are rare in the United States, but the consequences can be dire. Often, the virus lurks silently in the liver. It triggers inflammation that kills cells, which means someone may end up needing a transplant. But it also hijacks the genetic machinery and increases the likelihood of mutations. “We hear these stories all the time. Someone wakes up with tremendous pain in their side, they go to the emergency room, and by the end of the day, they’re told they have liver cancer,” Cohen said. “They don’t find out they have hep B until after they’re diagnosed with liver cancer, and they live for six weeks.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such horrible outcomes are part of the calculus behind a “birth dose.” While critics of the strategy point out that some countries such as Denmark don’t vaccinate against hepatitis B until later in infancy, American researchers respond that the setting is quite different: Unlike European countries with smaller populations and universal health care systems, the United States has no unified public health apparatus that tracks every baby born and every intervention they receive. Prenatal care falls through the cracks; childhood visits fall through the cracks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other issues emerge when trying to screen or vaccinate adults based on their risk, as was recommended in the 1980s. If patients get to the doctor’s office at all, doctors may not think to ask about risk factors. Even if they do, patients might not feel comfortable disclosing their histories of sexual encounters and drug use, for instance, given the potential for stigma. Plus, by then, it might be too late.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“How do you identify individuals before they become ‘at risk’? You can’t,” said Alter. “That’s why immunizing young children was such a successful strategy. Because, by doing that, you immunize the population before they develop risk factors, whatever those risk factors might be.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Plus, hundreds of millions of people have received the hepatitis B vaccine worldwide, and follow-up studies have shown that it is remarkably safe, with the most common side effects being fever, redness and soreness at the injection site, and vomiting. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to forget, when discussing statistics and stratifications of risk, that real people’s lives are at stake. There are antivirals that can help control hepatitis B, but there is no cure. Once people have it, they have it for life. If their immune systems become suppressed, it can roar out of hiding. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After she was diagnosed at 21, during a routine screening before a college semester abroad, Wendy Lo sometimes couldn’t bring herself to go to her appointments. She’d likely been infected from her mom at birth; every visit was a painful reminder of the stigma she’d inherited. “Monitoring was doing a number to my psychology,” said Lo, 52, a former tech professional who now works as a fitness coach and hepatitis B advocate. “It’s just telling me I have this blemish. It’s kind of like a scarlet letter, this stain.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She eventually did seek care, but at every stage, the virus shadowed her life. She canceled her study abroad program. The need to disclose her status made dating a minefield. Even the mildest of social drinking was off limits, given her elevated risk of liver failure. When she got married, her husband was protected by vaccines but she was terrified of giving the disease to her children. When doctors reassured her, saying that her babies would be safe with the administration of vaccines and other protective proteins, she worried that she might leave them without a mom. “Premature death, that is a very real and perpetual anxiety,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fear was heightened as her uncle died of liver failure caused by hepatitis B. There were jobs and promotions Lo didn’t accept because she worried the stress might be too much for her health, or because the new health insurance wouldn’t cover the hepatitis drugs she needed. There are all sorts of medications she’s avoided so as not to burden her liver. In her 40s, when she was diagnosed with scarring of the liver, she became so anxious she couldn’t eat or sleep or make even the most quotidian decision. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She’d been born years too early. But she can’t help but splice those two time frames together, and imagine what might’ve happened if she hadn’t gotten the virus, if she’d gone to do that semester abroad in Nanjing, if she’d stayed in China to start her career as planned — all of the worries and complications and curveballs she could have sidestepped with a vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The discovery offers a promising pathway toward targeted therapies using a familiar, already approved drug. Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MiR-93 promotes fatty liver disease, but vitamin B3 can counteract its effects. This discovery suggests a new treatment approach.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly 30% of people worldwide are affected by metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MASLD), a condition that until recently lacked targeted therapies. In an important breakthrough, scientists have identified a genetic factor that worsens the disease, and notably, the FDA-approved compound shown to be most effective against this factor is vitamin B3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A global first was achieved by a collaborative research group led by Professor Jang Hyun Choi of the Department of Life Sciences at UNIST, together with Professor Hwayoung Yun from the College of Pharmacy and Research Institute for Drug Development at Pusan National University (PNU) and Professor Neung Hwa Park from Ulsan University Hospital (UUH). Their work revealed the critical role of microRNA-93 (miR-93), a molecule expressed in the liver, as a genetic regulator influencing the onset and progression of MASLD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Role of miR-93 in liver function&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MiR-93 is a type of &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;RNA&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;RNA, or ribonucleic acid, is a single-stranded molecule involved in coding, decoding, and regulating gene expression. It acts as a messenger between DNA and protein synthesis and plays crucial roles in both genetic function and viral replication. Variants like mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA support different stages of protein assembly.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt; found in hepatocytes that suppresses the activity of specific target genes. Researchers detected unusually high levels of miR-93 in both human patients with fatty liver disease and in experimental animal models. Molecular studies showed that miR-93 drives lipid buildup, inflammation, and fibrosis by blocking the expression of SIRT1, a gene essential for regulating lipid metabolism in liver cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When scientists used gene-editing techniques to block miR-93 production in mice, they observed major reductions in liver fat accumulation, along with improved &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;insulin&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, crucial for regulating blood glucose levels. It helps cells in the body absorb glucose from the bloodstream and convert it into energy or store it for future use. Insulin production and action are essential for maintaining stable blood sugar levels. In people with diabetes, the body either does not produce enough insulin (Type 1 diabetes) or cannot effectively use the insulin it does produce (Type 2 diabetes), leading to elevated levels of glucose in the blood. This can cause various health complications over time, including heart disease, kidney damage, and nerve dysfunction. Insulin therapy, where insulin is administered through injections or an insulin pump, is a common treatment for managing diabetes, particularly Type 1. The discovery of insulin in 1921 by Frederick Banting and Charles Best was a landmark in medical science, transforming diabetes from a fatal disease to a manageable condition.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;insulin&lt;/span&gt; sensitivity and liver function markers. In contrast, mice engineered to overexpress miR-93 displayed more severe impairments in liver metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Vitamin B3 as a therapeutic candidate&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, screening 150 FDA-approved drugs revealed that niacin (vitamin B3) most effectively suppresses miR-93. Mice treated with niacin showed a significant decrease in hepatic miR-93 levels and a notable increase in SIRT1 activity. The activated SIRT1 restored disrupted lipid metabolism pathways, thereby normalizing liver lipid homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team explained, “This study precisely elucidates the molecular origin of MASLD and demonstrates the potential for repurposing an already approved vitamin compound to modulate this pathway, which has high translational clinical relevance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They added, “Given that niacin is a well-established and safe medication used to treat hyperlipidemia, it holds promise as a candidate for combination therapies targeting miRNA pathways in MASLD.”&lt;/p&gt;

The consistent changes in the gut microbiome of people who suffered from Parkinson’s across all populations, of major finding was that people with PD had higher microbial diversity, meaning, there was a more even distribution of bacterial species in the gut as compared to healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the people with PD showed a dramatic decline in genes involved in vital nutrient production. Genes such as riboflavin and biotin (Vitamin B2 and B7, respectively) were significantly low across all datasets. The abundance of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), which help microbes break down and utilize complex carbohydrates, was also markedly lower in the PD group, all of which are likely to impair gut barrier function, as many of the associated vitamins and metabolites are involved in maintaining the integrity of intestinal lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also See: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/parkinsons-disease-causes-symptoms-and-what-to-eat-or-avoid-for-better-management/articleshow/122568615.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Parkinson’s disease: Causes, symptoms, and what to eat or avoid for better management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The results suggest a stronger connection between the &lt;keyword id="26218001" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="gut-brain-axis" source="keywords"&gt;gut-brain axis&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research suggests that the deterioration of key microbial functions, especially those that support the gut barrier and protect the internal gut lining, could allow harmful proteins such as misfolded alpha-synuclein to emerge in the intestinal nervous system and travel to the brain via the vagus nerve. it not only highlights the gut microbiome as the potential contributor to PD but also a promising target for early detection, prevention and intervention. Future therapies may involve restoring gut microbial balance to halt or even reverse the progression of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 04:58:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggJBVV95cUxQbmVSekJUazd6NUM3VEtwWHlUVXg1TFFSQzNOcUg5cnBfOWllN3JzUzNzbHkxZkxlelFyeF9PWFlqV3RPTm1adlZzLXlsRVBlT18zNGdaaFZ5V3NxYk9WX0x3VjV2a1l5SEVHaEN4RGc1N0FzNS1rTTFtTDlrTkx6WmN5TEZfdFdJSEtNQWloOEM4dFR4MGdtWjFjVmFhOHZzVFlKakhzY29JVldwMkw4WFVmVkNqN1RUS0lqcUVlOTBmWlJ4clNGRWdZN21hOHFidXdCa19jRHFzekZWSXpyN1lLNVota0hlY19rWWVRTlVOaW5Fam1RSXFBcGhfT0Y3NFE</guid></item><item><title>言论自由和医疗错误信息之间的界限模糊不清-《金融时报》</title><link>https://www.ft.com/content/0be45570-a889-44f4-a2e2-e099b8e1d15d</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="card-content css-1onnxdk"&gt;&lt;p class="o-grid-row o3-type-body-highlight css-1rea6b9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="o3-visually-hidden"&gt;was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="crossed-out-price css-lhfuqt"&gt;$540&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o3-visually-hidden"&gt;now &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="price css-79fz17"&gt;$319&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; for your first year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="o-grid-row details-section o3-type-body-base css-pmzbjb"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Save now on essential digltal access to quality FT journalism on any device.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PORTLAND, Ore. — Some Oregonians are alarmed at the lack of vaccine access in the state right now after &lt;a href="/article/news/nation-world/why-getting-a-covid-vaccine-is-likely-to-be-more-complicated-this-year/507-51c133c5-d658-4bfc-abe9-52ca6b01dce1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;changes made at the federal level &lt;/a&gt;have&lt;a href="/article/news/health/coronavirus/vaccine/new-covid-vaccine-fda-recommendations-uncertainty/283-3ae8619e-eeb8-4aa4-a125-f6955b7dc99c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; caused confusion&lt;/a&gt;, and state agencies, doctors and pharmacists are still waiting for clarification on.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William and Karen Thomas live in Portland and are both over 65. When they went to get their COVID-19 booster shots, they hit roadblock after roadblock, and they still don’t have them.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We go and get our booster whenever it’s time, and so, we were ready to go get our booster and get that over with and be done, and instead, we wasted our time going down there, and I’ve been checking around ever since and it’s all very confusing,” Karen Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her husband reiterated that they should be able to get one.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're at the age where we're allowed to get these shots, and we're having trouble getting them," William Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the federal government announced the updated COVID-19 vaccines are now approved for people 65+, as well as kids and adults with at least one pre-existing condition that puts them at risk for severe illness. Even though the FDA cleared the vaccine, the CDC’s Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) hasn’t issued its recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oregon state policy forbids pharmacists from giving out the vaccine to anyone without a prescription until ACIP issues its recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, multiple people told KGW that doctors have been hesitant to issue a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They said that they were having to deal with the authorities on that and they couldn’t give us a prescription,” William Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We shouldn't have to feel like we’re going to be on the edge of catching this virus again and get sick again,” Karen Thomas said. “We’ve had it — but not badly because we’re vaccinated — so that’s the part that makes it so horrible.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACIP is expected to meet Sept. 18-19, months later than in previous years, which Brooklyn Pharmacy owner Pat Hubbell said has created an unnecessary burden.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is unfortunate that they were unable to release these recommendations before the season got started,” Hubbell said. “This does create a lot of confusion. It does create a lot of chaos within the health care community and our patient community, so it's really unfortunate. This probably could have been avoided.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duane Medley also encountered an initial roadblock with his physician trying to get a prescription, but he eventually was told he could.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They said, ‘Well, we don’t have clear protocol yet. We're not sure what to do,” Medley said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington Department of Health&lt;a href="/article/news/health/coronavirus/vaccine/washington-state-department-health-covid-19-shot/281-8111e01b-97d0-4d50-a981-aab796210c4c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; signed a standing order into effect &lt;/a&gt;last week, allowing anyone in the state 6 months or older to receive the vaccine without a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medley said he’d like to see Oregon follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whatever it takes to make the process easier should be done,” Medley said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Gov. Tina Kotek told KGW a standing order similar to Washington’s is something their office is exploring.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Research on the microbes living in our digestive tract has triggered a '&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9503711/"&gt;revolution&lt;/a&gt;' in nutritional science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, dietary fiber has become the "&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/inulin-is-being-added-to-many-foods-but-it-could-be-causing-stomach-problems"&gt;new protein&lt;/a&gt;", added to foods &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-create-invisible-fiber-that-can-make-cakes-and-pizzas-better-for-you"&gt;in abundance&lt;/a&gt; to feed our gut's microbiome and boost our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a study on mice published in 2024 suggests that not all fiber supplements are equally beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-fiber-could-protect-you-from-infections-heres-why"&gt;Eating Fiber Could Protect You From Infections. Here's Why.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A form that is readily found in oats and barley, called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oat_beta-glucan"&gt;beta-glucan&lt;/a&gt;, can control blood sugar and assist in weight loss among mice fed a high-fat diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Arizona (UA) and the University of Vienna found it decreased a mouse's fat content and body weight within 18 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other fibers they tested, including wheat dextrin, pectin, resistant starch, and cellulose, had no such effect, despite shifting the makeup of the mouse microbiome significantly compared to mice fed no fiber supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know that fiber is important and beneficial; the problem is that there are so many different types," &lt;a href="https://news.arizona.edu/news/how-your-morning-oats-could-help-you-manage-your-weight"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; biomedical scientist Frank Duca from UA in July last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We wanted to know what kind of fiber would be most beneficial for weight loss and improvements in glucose homeostasis so that we can inform the community, the consumer, and then also inform the agricultural industry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietary fibers are the &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-nutrition-society/article/interactions-between-dietary-fibre-and-the-gut-microbiota/0BEF28B809F38D02AC0B1D4E4990210C"&gt;main source of energy&lt;/a&gt; for bacteria living in our guts, and &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/health-benefits-dietary-fibers-vary"&gt;yet less than 5 percent&lt;/a&gt; of people in the US consume the &lt;a href="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/increasing-fiber-intake"&gt;recommended 25–30 grams (0.9–1 ounce)&lt;/a&gt; of fiber a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_133570" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-133570" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OatsAndABowl.jpg" alt="A bowl of oats and some oat grains " class="size-full wp-image-133570" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OatsAndABowl.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OatsAndABowl-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-133570" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Beta-glucan is found in oats and barley. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADat1fdGi4/"&gt;ArxOnt/Canva Pro&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make up for this, fiber supplements and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-create-invisible-fiber-that-can-make-cakes-and-pizzas-better-for-you"&gt;'invisible fiber'-infused foods&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/inulin-is-being-added-to-many-foods-but-it-could-be-causing-stomach-problems"&gt;growing in popularity&lt;/a&gt;. But fibers are extremely diverse, so which do we choose?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some fibers, like oat beta-glucans and wheat dextrin, are water-&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/compare-dietary-fibers"&gt;soluble&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they are easily fermented by gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others, like cellulose and resistant starch, are less soluble or insoluble, meaning they &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/whats-the-difference-between-soluble-and-insoluble-fiber"&gt;stick to other materials to form stool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjnut.2024.05.003"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; biomedical scientist Elizabeth Howard from UA and her colleagues, "there is no study that has investigated the role of various fibers in one cohort."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make up for this, the current study tested several forms of fiber in one cohort of mice. Only beta-glucan was found to increase the number of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileibacterium"&gt;Ileibacterium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in the mouse intestine. Other &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/nxy011"&gt;studies on mice&lt;/a&gt; have linked this bacterium to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, long before the 10-week marker, mice fed beta-glucan showed reduced body weight and body fat content compared to mice fed other forms of fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings align with another recent &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12986-023-00767-8"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Duca, which fed barley flour, rich in beta-glucan, to rodents. Even though the rats continued eating just as much of their high-fat diet as before, their energy expenditure increased and they lost weight anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar outcome was observed in mice fed beta-glucan in the new study. These animals also showed increased concentrations of butyrate in their guts, which is a metabolite made when microbes break down fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Butyrate induces the release of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which is the natural protein that synthetic drugs like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-ozempic-and-why-are-people-saying-its-a-sad-way-to-lose-weight"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; mimic to stimulate insulin release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_124692" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-124692" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/FingersHoldOzempicPen-642x260.jpg" alt="Fingers Hold Ozempic Pen" class="size-medium wp-image-124692" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/FingersHoldOzempicPen-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/FingersHoldOzempicPen-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/FingersHoldOzempicPen-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/FingersHoldOzempicPen.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-124692" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Ozempic and other semaglutide drugs mimic the effects of GLP-1. (imyskin/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Part of the benefits of consuming dietary fiber is through the release of GLP-1 and other gut peptides that regulate appetite and body weight," &lt;a href="https://news.arizona.edu/news/how-your-morning-oats-could-help-you-manage-your-weight"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Duca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, we don't think that's all of the effect. We think that there are other beneficial things that butyrate could be doing that are not gut peptide related, such as improving gut barrier health and targeting peripheral organs like the liver."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far more research is needed before these results can be extended to humans, but the findings suggest that some fibers may be better suited to weight loss and insulin control than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjnut.2024.05.003"&gt;Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in July 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;COVID-19 is no longer one of the top 10 causes of death in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Early data on deaths in 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr039.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;published by&lt;/a&gt; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, show that COVID dropped from the list for the first time since the start of the pandemic. It became the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db456.htm" target="_blank"&gt;third leading cause of death&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. in 2020, and remained among the leading causes until now.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"COVID is still in the top 15 leading causes of death, so it hasn't disappeared," says Farida Ahmad, a health scientist at the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics and lead author on the publication.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Since its &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db456.htm" target="_blank"&gt;peak in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, when more than 463,000 people died from COVID, it has been moving steadily down the list. Last year, it was a factor in around &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;47,000&lt;/a&gt; U.S. deaths.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Overall, deaths last year were down 4% from the previous year, and it was the third consecutive year of that downward trend, Ahmad says. The declines extend across the board, to most age groups and to people of all races and ethnicities, and can be attributed to a number of factors, such as fewer deaths from COVID and from drug overdoses, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The leading causes of death included suicide, diabetes, kidney disease, and unintentional injury. Heart disease and cancer — both chronic diseases — remained the top two leading causes of death, as they have been for more than a decade, and were responsible for more than 40% of U.S. deaths in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Death rates were higher for men than women, for older adults, and for Black Americans compared with other racial and ethnic groups.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The fact that we're seeing people living into older and older age and dying of chronic diseases is a sign that we've been successful at dealing with infectious diseases," says Kathleen Ethier, a former CDC official at the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion&lt;/a&gt;, who left the agency in January and was not involved in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Tackling chronic diseases takes a different strategy, Ethier says: "These are things that develop over time, that are highly impacted by our behavior and environments and genetics."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;With heart disease, for instance, a person may have higher risks if they have a family history of the condition, if they live in &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.123.323613" target="_blank"&gt;stressful or polluted environments&lt;/a&gt;, if they mainly eat &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/05/25/1178163270/ultra-processed-foods-health-risk-weight-gain" target="_blank"&gt;ultraprocessed foods&lt;/a&gt;, and if they have spotty access to health care. "What kinds of food can people afford? Do they have insurance and money to pay for services? Those are difficult, entrenched things for public health to impact," Ethier says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. released a report titled "Make Our Children Healthy Again," which &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/09/nx-s1-5534412/rfk-maha-report-childrens-health" target="_blank"&gt;drew mixed reviews&lt;/a&gt; from public health advocates, who note that its goals clash with other recent moves by the Trump Administration, including cuts to food assistance, scientific research, Medicaid programs and changes that limit access to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What this administration is doing is going to make the top ten causes of death worse," says Ethier. She notes that President Trump's &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;FY 2026 budget&lt;/a&gt; targets the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC division&lt;/a&gt; that's focused on preventing chronic diseases for elimination in. This includes the &lt;a href="https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/press-releases/2025_05_05_administrations-budget-would-devastate-cdc-efforts-to-fight-chronic-disease-and-tobacco-use" target="_blank"&gt;office that deals with smoking&lt;/a&gt;, a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke and some cancers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            Among all high-income Western countries, the United States has shown the worst performance in reducing the probability of dying from chronic diseases, a new study finds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvyce00043b6ngt3q0w0d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            From 2010 to 2019, deaths due to chronic diseases declined in most age groups in the US but increased among adults 20 to 45, “a rare phenomenon in high-income western countries,” according to the study, published Wednesday in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01388-1/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvyce00053b6njctdoh28@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study, led by researchers at Imperial College London, analyzed data on 185 countries and territories and found that, from 2010 to 2019, the probability of dying by age 80 from a noncommunicable disease — such as cancer, heart disease and stroke — declined in most of those countries, but the decline&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;had slowed compared with&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the previous decade.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvyce00063b6nild6cgho@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The risk of dying – or what we call probability in the paper – from chronic diseases in most countries in the world is coming down,” said Majid Ezzati, the study’s senior author and a professor in the School of Public Health at Imperial College London and Imperial Global Ghana.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvyce00073b6necpuru5j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But we were doing better before,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvyce00083b6nz5rda8n1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among the 25 high-income Western countries in the study, Denmark had the largest decline in chronic disease deaths, while the United States had the smallest, and Germany did only slightly better than the United States.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvyce00093b6nqn9mrc75@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The US is the slowest, but it’s by no means the exception,” Ezzati said. “Germany is doing nearly as badly.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000a3b6nuznk8at0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among the high-income Western countries, there were small to moderate declines in the probability of dying from a chronic disease by age 80 from 2010 to 2019&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;overall. But the researchers noted that a possible reason why the declines were not larger as a group is that in many countries, neuropsychiatric conditions such as dementia increased and contributed unfavorably to the trends.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000b3b6nt75iqwnh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new study included data from the World Health Organization’s &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/data/global-health-estimates" target="_blank"&gt;Global Health Estimates&lt;/a&gt;, and the team of researchers analyzed deaths between time periods, countries and by age groups: young adults 20 to 45, working-age adults 45 to 65, and older adults 65 to 80.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000c3b6n7sccev1z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The data showed that from 2010 to 2019, chronic disease deaths declined in about 80% of the world’s countries, home to more than 70% of the global population.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000d3b6nazce3hrr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The reasons for widespread decline in chronic disease mortality could be tied to improvements in diagnosing and treating chronic diseases, according to the study. For instance, there have been changes in clinical guidelines as well as increases in the use of certain medications and the early detection of certain cancers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000e3b6nchlfuy6c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But in about 60% of countries, either the decline in chronic disease deaths from 2010 to 2019 was smaller than it had been in the preceding decade or there was a reversal of an earlier decline, the data showed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000f3b6nzrshd1ia@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The countries that did really well did well both in older and working ages. Countries that did really badly did badly in both older and working ages,” Ezzati said. “And then there was some tradeoff between these. Some places never slowed down in older ages, but they have in working ages, and vice versa.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000g3b6ndumo1prx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            From 2010 to 2019, Finland, Norway and Denmark all had a slower decline in chronic disease deaths among older ages than they had in the previous decade. But they still maintained significant progress in reducing the risk of chronic disease deaths overall because that slower decline among older adults was countered by faster declines among working-age adults.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000h3b6n2nyupit9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the United States, small reductions in mortality among older adults were combined with a stagnation among working-age adults and increases in mortality among young adults, leading to the nation’s poor performance compared with other high-income Western countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000i3b6nndxkmozs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study did not analyze why some countries had greater improvements than others in reducing the probability of chronic disease deaths, but Ezzati had some ideas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000j3b6nxtz69a9w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In both high-income Western countries that performed poorly compared with their peers – the United States and Germany – there are segments of the population in which there has been less investment in public health, he noted, and these disparities in investment can lead to broad barriers to accessing care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000k3b6nw55t9kn7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For instance, a barrier can be not having a primary care physician in your local area, which can lead to the delayed screening for and diagnosis of chronic conditions, Ezzati said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000l3b6nnw91guzz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many Americans live in areas where critical-care services are lacking. It’s estimated that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/03/health/hospital-deserts"&gt;nearly 30 million Americans don’t live within an hour of trauma care&lt;/a&gt;. And a CNN analysis has found that people living in 16% of the mainland United States are 30 miles or more from the nearest hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The United States also has had a rise in the probability of dying from neuropsychiatric conditions, such as dementia and alcohol use disorders, which did not appear to offset continued declines in deaths from cancers and cardiovascular diseases – and these trends could have contributed to the nation’s poor performance in reducing chronic disease mortality, according to the researchers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000p3b6nr7214aud@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new study was published a day after the Trump administration released the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/09/health/make-america-healthy-again-maha-report"&gt;Make America Healthy Again Commission&lt;/a&gt;’s action plan on reducing &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/maha-commission-report-childhood-disease-strategy.html" target="_blank"&gt;childhood chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt; in the United States.

            US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has made tackling chronic diseases a primary focus. In an &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/bretbaier/reel/DOZjGEPj3c3/" target="_blank"&gt;interview Tuesday on Fox News&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy noted that the share of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2025/24_0539.htm" target="_blank"&gt;US adults with at least one chronic condition is 76.4%&lt;/a&gt;, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Elena Ladas, a professor of global integrative medicine at Columbia University and an expert on noncommunicable diseases in young people, said she is optimistic the United States is heading toward embracing wellness as a prevention tool to reduce chronic disease deaths, but she wants to see a clear implementation plan.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000t3b6n69djci5b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’re talking about the right things: Ultraprocessed foods need to really be minimized, and exposures to pesticides and environmental contaminants,” Ladas said of the MAHA report. “They’re talking about what I think a lot of epidemiologists and clinicians have been saying for a very long time. But how they’re going to implement that remains to be seen.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000u3b6nta4i7ft8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ladas, who was not involved in the new study but has done public health work in nearly two dozen countries, said the United States should “think about wellness comprehensively” to reduce the burden of chronic disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000v3b6n9brmur57@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Wellness approaches include good nutrition. We need to make healthy food reasonably priced. A lot of times, farmer’s markets are more expensive than the grocery store. You don’t see that in Europe. In Europe, farmer’s markets are far less expensive than grocery stores,” Ladas said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000w3b6nxyp4yfic@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And mental health can include meditation and deep-breathing,” she added. “There are more holistic wellness approaches to include for a lot of these chronic conditions versus being only medication-based resolutions. You need both.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USF and FAU researchers identify bacterium behind 1,500-year-old pandemic mystery.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time, scientists have obtained direct genomic evidence of the bacterium responsible for the Plague of Justinian, the earliest known pandemic in recorded history. The outbreak, which struck the Eastern Mediterranean nearly 1,500 years ago, has now been firmly tied to &lt;em&gt;Yersinia pestis&lt;/em&gt;, the pathogen that causes plague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An international team led by researchers at the University of South Florida and Florida Atlantic University, working with partners in India and Australia, identified &lt;em&gt;Y. pestis&lt;/em&gt; in human remains from a mass grave at the ancient city of Jerash in Jordan, close to the heart of the pandemic. This pivotal discovery confirms the bacterium’s role in the Justinian Plague (AD 541–750), resolving a mystery that has lingered for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_493351" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-493351" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rays-Jiang-1-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-493351" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rays-Jiang-1-777x519.jpg" alt="Rays Jiang" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rays-Jiang-1-777x519.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rays-Jiang-1-400x267.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rays-Jiang-1-768x513.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rays-Jiang-1-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rays-Jiang-1-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rays-Jiang-1-150x100.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rays-Jiang-1-450x300.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rays-Jiang-1-1200x801.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-493351" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Rays Jiang, PhD, University of South Florida.

&lt;h4&gt;Filling historical gaps with genetic proof&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For hundreds of years, scholars debated the origins of the catastrophic outbreak that killed tens of millions, reshaped the Byzantine Empire, and altered the trajectory of Western history. Although written accounts hinted at plague, no biological proof had been available, leaving a critical gap in the narrative of pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, two newly released papers led by USF and FAU provide that missing proof, offering fresh insight into one of humanity’s most transformative health crises. The findings also highlight plague’s continued presence today: although uncommon, &lt;em&gt;Y. pestis&lt;/em&gt; still circulates globally. In July, a resident of northern Arizona died from pneumonic plague, the deadliest form of the disease and the first U.S. fatality since 2007, followed just a week later by a confirmed case in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_493348" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-493348" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/USF-Researcher-Holding-Excavated-Human-Tooth-With-Roots-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-493348" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/USF-Researcher-Holding-Excavated-Human-Tooth-With-Roots-777x378.jpg" alt="USF Researcher Holding Excavated Human Tooth With Roots" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/USF-Researcher-Holding-Excavated-Human-Tooth-With-Roots-777x378.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/USF-Researcher-Holding-Excavated-Human-Tooth-With-Roots-400x194.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/USF-Researcher-Holding-Excavated-Human-Tooth-With-Roots-768x373.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/USF-Researcher-Holding-Excavated-Human-Tooth-With-Roots-1536x747.jpg 1536w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/USF-Researcher-Holding-Excavated-Human-Tooth-With-Roots-2048x996.jpg 2048w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/USF-Researcher-Holding-Excavated-Human-Tooth-With-Roots-150x73.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/USF-Researcher-Holding-Excavated-Human-Tooth-With-Roots-450x219.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/USF-Researcher-Holding-Excavated-Human-Tooth-With-Roots-1200x583.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-493348" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Tooth from the Jerash architectural site.

&lt;p&gt;“This discovery provides the long-sought definitive proof of &lt;em&gt;Y. pestis&lt;/em&gt; at the epicenter of the Plague of Justinian,” said Rays H. Y. Jiang, PhD, lead PI of the studies and associate professor with the USF College of Public Health. “For centuries, we’ve relied on written accounts describing a devastating disease, but lacked any hard biological evidence of plague’s presence. Our findings provide the missing piece of that puzzle, offering the first direct genetic window into how this pandemic unfolded at the heart of the empire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Evidence of widespread mortality&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Plague of Justinian was first documented in Pelusium (modern-day Tell el-Farama) in Egypt, before sweeping across the Eastern Roman, or Byzantine, Empire. Although remnants of &lt;em&gt;Y. pestis&lt;/em&gt; had been detected in small villages in western Europe thousands of miles away, no genetic evidence had ever been uncovered within the empire itself or close to the pandemic’s center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Using targeted ancient &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;DNA&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a molecule made of two long strands of nucleotides twisted into a double helix. It serves as the hereditary material in humans and nearly all other organisms, encoding the genetic instructions used for development, functioning, and reproduction. Most DNA resides in the cell nucleus (nuclear DNA), while a smaller portion is found in mitochondria (mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; techniques, we successfully recovered and sequenced genetic material from eight human teeth excavated from burial chambers beneath the former Roman hippodrome in Jerash, a city just 200 miles from ancient Pelusium,” said Greg O’Corry-Crowe, PhD, co-author and a research professor at FAU Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute and a National Geographic Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_493347" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-493347" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/The-Ancient-DNA-Lab-at-Florida-Atlantic-University.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-493347" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/The-Ancient-DNA-Lab-at-Florida-Atlantic-University.jpg" alt="The Ancient DNA Lab at Florida Atlantic University" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/The-Ancient-DNA-Lab-at-Florida-Atlantic-University.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/The-Ancient-DNA-Lab-at-Florida-Atlantic-University-400x240.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/The-Ancient-DNA-Lab-at-Florida-Atlantic-University-768x461.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/The-Ancient-DNA-Lab-at-Florida-Atlantic-University-150x90.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/The-Ancient-DNA-Lab-at-Florida-Atlantic-University-450x270.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-493347" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The Ancient DNA lab at Florida Atlantic University. Credit: FAU&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arena had been repurposed as a mass grave during the mid-sixth to early seventh century, when written accounts describe a sudden wave of mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genomic analysis revealed that the plague victims carried nearly identical strains of &lt;em&gt;Y. pestis&lt;/em&gt;, confirming for the first time that the bacterium was present within the Byzantine Empire between AD 550-660. That genetic uniformity suggests a rapid, devastating outbreak consistent with historical descriptions of a plague causing mass death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Jerash site offers a rare glimpse of how ancient societies responded to public health disasters,” said Jiang. “Jerash was one of the key cities of the Eastern Roman Empire, a documented trade hub with magnificent structures. That a venue once built for entertainment and civic pride became a mass cemetery in a time of emergency shows how urban centers were very likely overwhelmed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Broader evolutionary patterns&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/14/8/797"&gt;companion study&lt;/a&gt;, also led by USF and FAU, places the Jerash discovery into a wider evolutionary context. By analyzing hundreds of ancient and modern &lt;em&gt;Y. pestis &lt;/em&gt;genomes — including those newly recovered from Jerash — the researchers showed that the bacteria had been circulating among human populations for millennia before the Justinian outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also found that later plague pandemics, from the Black Death of the 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century to cases still appearing today, did not descend from a single ancestral strain. Instead, they arose independently and repeatedly from longstanding animal reservoirs, erupting in multiple waves across different regions and eras. This repeated pattern stands in stark contrast to the &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;SARS-CoV-2&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, first identified in Wuhan, China, in late 2019.

&lt;p&gt;Together, the landmark findings reshape the understanding of how pandemics emerge, recur and spread, and why they remain a persistent feature of human civilization. The research underscores that pandemics are not singular historical catastrophes, but repeating biological events driven by human congregation, mobility and environmental change — themes that remain relevant today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Shared humanity across pandemics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This research was both scientifically compelling and personally resonant. It offered an extraordinary opportunity to delve into the study of human history through the lens of ancient DNA at a time when we ourselves were living through a global pandemic,” said O’Corry-Crowe. “Equally profound was the experience of working with ancient human remains — individuals who lived, suffered, and died centuries ago — and using modern science to help recover and share their stories. It’s a humbling reminder of our shared humanity across time and a moving testament to the power of science to give voice to those long silent.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While very different from COVID-19, both diseases highlight the enduring link between connectivity and pandemic risk, as well as the reality that some pathogens can never be fully eradicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been wrestling with plague for a few thousand years, and people still die from it today,” Jiang said. “Like COVID, it continues to evolve, and containment measures evidently can’t get rid of it. We have to be careful, but the threat will never go away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on the Jerash breakthrough, the team is now expanding its research to Venice, Italy, and the Lazaretto Vecchio, a dedicated quarantine island and one of the world’s most significant plague burial sites. More than 1,200 samples from this Black Death-era mass grave are now housed at USF, offering an unprecedented opportunity to study how early public health measures intersected with pathogen evolution, urban vulnerability, and cultural memory.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — West Nile virus infections are intense so far this year, with case counts running 40% higher than normal, health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 770 cases, including about 490 severe cases, were reported as of early September, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/data-maps/current-year-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;data posted this week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. About 550 cases — 350 of them severe — are usually reported by this time of year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials are ramping up warnings to the public, because most cases of the mosquito-borne disease are reported in August and September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“West Nile virus can be a very serious disease and its presence in mosquitoes remains high right now in Massachusetts,” said the state’s public health commissioner, Dr. Robbie Goldstein, in a statement last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can protect themselves by wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants when possible, and using an EPA-registered &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/mosquito-repellent-cdc-recommends-e47c0c35ffe49d6f36b39d03f1b95e06"&gt;insect repellent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; when spending time outdoors, health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus was first reported in the United States in 1999 in New York, and then gradually spread across the country. It &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/data-maps/historic-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;peaked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 2003, when nearly 10,000 cases were reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists say many people — perhaps tens of thousands each year — are infected but don’t know it because they have no symptoms, or only mild ones such as headaches, body aches, joint pain, vomiting, diarrhea and rashes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In severe cases, damage to the central nervous system causes inflammation of the brain or spinal cord, and even death.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;In the last decade, health officials have fielded reports of 2,000 cases annually on average, including 1,200 life-threatening neurological illnesses and approximately 120 deaths. Deaths are on pace to be higher this year, CDC officials said, but they declined to discuss specifics, saying mortality statistics are too preliminary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is not that there are more mosquitoes this year, but rather that a higher proportion of the bugs are carrying the virus, CDC officials said. Mosquito infection rates can be affected by such factors as temperature, rainfall, the amount of insect control going on, and how many nearby birds are infected.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Colorado, which tends to see more West Nile virus, has reported about 150 of the nation’s cases — more than double what other states are reporting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fort Collins is a hot spot. Monitoring last month in an area in the southwest part of the city found that 35 out of every 1,000 female mosquitoes were infected — far higher than the 8 per 1,000 that would be expected for that time of year — said Roxanne Connelly, a CDC entomologist who lives there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear why, but she noted it’s been a wet and warm year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

&lt;p&gt;“Whereas what is happening at HHS is … a lot of opinions, particularly from RFK Jr. himself, on unproven therapeutics, on risks that are not borne out by the data. And then he’s sort of just hand-waving and doing whatever he wants,” Karan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5428533/rfk-jr-vaccine-advisory-committee-acip"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; all 17 members of an advisory committee that helps the CDC form its vaccine policies to begin to “&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/wsj-kennedy-op-ed-restore-public-trust-in-vaccines.html"&gt;restore public trust in vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/people/john-swartzberg"&gt;Dr. John Swartzberg&lt;/a&gt;, professor emeritus of infectious diseases and vaccinology at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health, said that by following the advice of leading medical groups, California and the other states of the West Coast Alliance are making it easier for families to get their children vaccinated against COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you look at the data for very young children in terms of hospitalization and death, the rates are pretty comparable to older Americans,” Swartzberg said. “This is a vulnerable population where protection is terribly important. So I think that the California Department of Public Health, in following the advice of the American Academy of Pediatrics, is spot on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swartzberg said it is interesting to note that President Donald Trump even pushed back on Kennedy’s anti-vax stance in the last few days. Trump even &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/08/vaccine-policy-cracks-showing-between-trump-kennedy/"&gt;expressed some skepticism&lt;/a&gt; about Florida’s push to phase out all childhood vaccine mandates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think there are people in the administration who recognize that this is a hot button item, and all the Republicans are not really on board with where Kennedy is, so that might translate into the administration not trying to make a political football out of this with California,” he said. “We are very fortunate here in California. We have a department of health that is science-based and really solid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who can get a new COVID vaccine right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The updated 2025–26 COVID-19 vaccines are currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.cvs.com/scheduling/patient-lookup?lob=rximz&amp;amp;flow=vaccine&amp;amp;icid=global-nav"&gt;CVS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.walgreens.com/topic/promotion/covid-vaccine.jsp?ban=immhub_covidinfo"&gt;Walgreens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.safeway.com/pharmacy/covid-19.html"&gt;Safeway &lt;/a&gt;pharmacies in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Pharmacies take their cue from the federal government, not the states, so they’ve always been the first places that COVID-19 vaccines roll out — before shots become more widely available through providers and public health authorities.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These pharmacy appointments are only available to people who, during the online booking process, say they are either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Age 65 and older&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a health condition that could make someone at higher risk from COVID-19.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what counts as “high risk”? To find out if you or a family member might qualify, you can consult &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/risk-factors/index.html"&gt;the CDC’s current list of health conditions&lt;/a&gt; that potentially put you at higher risk of severe illness, hospitalization or death from COVID-19, which includes cancer, chronic lung, kidney and liver disease and certain disabilities. However, it also encompasses other factors like mental health conditions — including depression — obesity and being a current or former smoker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When listing some of these conditions, CVS’s online appointment also suggests “any other conditions or situations that place you at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 (consult your pharmacist or medical provider if you need help).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most conversations about menopause health revolve around things like hot flashes and brain fog, but new research points to another less discussed but no less impactful change to women’s health: voice changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All women undergo menopause, which occurs, on average, around age 52 at the point when menstruation stops occurring. In a comprehensive review of existing literature on menopause, researchers shine a spotlight on how menopausal vocal changes are both less understood and potentially more significant for certain women.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Voice changes during menopause are subtle [and] gradual but for those who use their voice a lot — voice super users — these have massive implications on their daily life and also their profession,” says &lt;a href="https://ai.northeastern.edu/our-people/rupal-patel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rupal Patel&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of communication sciences and disorders and director of the Voice of Women Lab at Northeastern University. “Many times the other symptoms of menopause have more attention but voice changes, because they’re subtle and gradual, are not necessarily given the same importance in terms of affecting the individual’s life.”&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p&gt;During menopause, estrogen levels decrease, which changes tissue in the vocal folds. The end result is women’s voices get deeper and hoarser, and it can even get harder to project the voice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In reviewing the literature around menopause, Patel and collaborators found that these changes are not well studied and “not necessarily well understood” in part because they are so gradual that most women might not notice them unless someone else draws attention to it. However, for women who use their voice a lot — teachers, reporters or voice actors, for example — these changes have much more of an impact, Patel notes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://news.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rupal_Patel.jpg?w=1100" alt="Portrait of Rupal Patel." class="wp-image-277502" srcset="https://news.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rupal_Patel.jpg 1400w, https://news.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rupal_Patel.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://news.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rupal_Patel.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://news.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rupal_Patel.jpg?resize=1100,733 1100w, https://news.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rupal_Patel.jpg?resize=196,130 196w, https://news.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rupal_Patel.jpg?resize=335,223 335w, https://news.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rupal_Patel.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The other symptoms of menopause might get more of the spotlight but vocal changes are worth studying and understanding, says Rupal Patel, a professor of communication sciences and disorders and director of the Voice of Women Lab at Northeastern University.

&lt;p&gt;“If you’re a teacher or in any one of these professions that uses the voice a lot, it can actually mean a difference between taking days off of work and being productive or not,” Patel says. “Voice-over actors who are females often complain that they’re no longer desirable voices.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s actually a big issue because most of the voice super users, 75% of them are women,” Patel adds. “If you think about teachers, 75% of teachers are women. If you think about voice-over artists, there’s just a high predominance of women.”&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p&gt;Another reason very little attention has been paid to menopausal vocal changes is that they have historically been conflated with other conditions. As much as Patel and her Voice of Women Lab, or VOxx Lab, are trying to analyze the voice as a marker for certain health conditions, she notes that the human voice is a “sensitive kind of cue.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If someone’s voice changes, we don’t know if it’s due to these hormonal changes or due to a neurological change,” Patel says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Patel and her lab aim to fill the knowledge gap around these vocal changes that all women will go through in their lives. New technology, like artificial intelligence, has unlocked the potential to study the human voice in even more subtle ways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previously, Patel, through the company she founded, VocaliD, cloned the voices of female voice-over artists with their permission, partially as a way of preempting some of the issues women face later in their careers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They knew that people would have less interest in their voice as they aged, and they thought that would be an insurance policy,” Patel says. “If they banked their voice ahead of time, created their synthetic voice, they could still speak as their younger selves with their synthetic voice and then as their voice ages take on other roles.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finding the gaps that have existed in previous research has spurred new lines of research that Patel and her collaborators are in the early stages of pursuing. They include an examination of how hormone replacement therapy can help improve women’s voices later in life and even a study of how menopausal changes to the oral cavity can trigger sleep apnea in women.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The end goal of all this work, Patel says, is to better understand, and potentially remedy, something that for far too long has been understudied and underdiscussed, despite being a factor in half of the population’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“How can this be ignored for so long when 100% of women, regardless of whether you’ve had a child or not, are going to go through menopause?” Patel says.&lt;/p&gt;
