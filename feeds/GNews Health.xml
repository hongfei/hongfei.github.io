class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Obesity is associated with &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(24)00201-1/fulltext#:~:text=A%20report%20from%20the%20International,pancreas%2C%20breast%20(postmenopausal)%2C" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;13 different cancers&lt;/a&gt;. While losing weight reduces that risk, scientists have calculated weight-loss injections have a bigger protective effect over and above shedding the kilos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Researchers in Israel studied 6,000 adults with no prior history of cancer, who either underwent bariatric surgery or took glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) liraglutide (Saxenda), exenatide (Byetta) or dulaglutide (Trulicity). The drugs work by mimicking the GLP-1 hormone in the body, which lowers blood sugar levels and makes people feel fuller for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although those who had bariatric surgery lost around double the weight of those on weight-loss medication, the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.%201016/j.eclinm.2025.%20103213" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, presented at the European Congress on Obesity in Malaga, Spain, and published in The Lancet’s eClinicalMedicine, found the reduction in cancer risk was broadly the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Bariatric surgery reduces the risk of cancer by 30-42%, the researchers said. Therefore, accounting for the relative advantage of surgery in reducing patients’ weight, the authors found weight-loss drugs were more effective at preventing obesity-related cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The protective effects of GLP-1RAs against obesity-related cancers likely arise from multiple mechanisms, including reducing inflammation,” said co-lead author Prof Dror Dicker from Hasharon Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Newer drugs could prove even more beneficial, he added. “New generation, highly potent GLP-1RAs with higher efficacy in weight reduction may convey an even greater advantage in reducing the risk of obesity-related cancers, but future research is needed to make sure these drugs do not increase the risk for non-obesity-related cancers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A separate &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2416394" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, presented at the conference and published in New England Journal of Medicine, directly compared weight-loss jabs and found patients taking Mounjaro lost about 50% more weight than those taking Wegovy. Patients on Mounjaro typically saw a 20.2% drop in body weight at the end of the trial compared with 13.7% with Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Responding to the findings, Prof Mark Lawler, an internationally renowned cancer research expert from Queen’s University Belfast, said while this was an observational study and caution was needed interpreting the results, the results were very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We already know bariatric surgery cuts obesity-related cancer risk by about a third; these data suggest target GLP-1s may cut that risk by nearly 50% – an approach that would be transformational in preventing obesity-related cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Biologically, this makes sense, as targeting GLP-1 dampens down inflammation, one of the hallmarks of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“While further work is required on how it works, these data raise the intriguing possibility that a GLP-1 jab could prevent multiple cancers in the general population, including common cancers like breast and colorectal, and difficult to treat cancers like pancreatic and ovarian. This work could herald a whole new era of preventive cancer medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Jason Halford, former president of the European Association for the Study of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/obesity" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt; and head of psychology at Leeds University, said the drugs should also be tested in patients with newly diagnosed cancers to see if they boosted survival chances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He added the drugs had “the potential to be a new dawn. And it’s not just prevention, weight management in people recently diagnosed with cancer is also critical in terms of outcomes. That would be the next thing to look at. More and more cancers are being associated with obesity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A team of 54 international experts from 12 different countries issued a joint statement at the conference, calling for weight-loss drugs to be trialled as a priority for cancer prevention. As a result, a UK team of scientists, based at the University of Manchester and funded by Cancer Research UK, are planning a large-scale clinical trial involving tens of thousands of patients, which they hope to get under way within “three to five years”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Matthew Harris, at the Manchester Cancer Research Centre, said weight-loss jabs “provide genuinely fantastic weight loss, and may provide an intervention that could be delivered on a population-scale, where we have not been able to achieve this before”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 22:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxPSjMtbGhVazM4NUZqOURXbTlGVzRSWk02ODhBcnVqVDVzMW9sU2VDaTVDVUlaQkRVaG5aZGRGYk5Hc1RRNzJ5U0FBeGNpNWpnRU1YNjJycUtvdnI1SDBodWRwSzByUG1PSTA3RDljeVN6RExEd19CMVlLQ0R2dUt3TE9YUzZ1d0JMYXYwa1Q2b0RueklnY0ljbUszRzhDQlYyYlA1UTBQY2RvSktHeFBpb19tZFV2eGptSGxnTQ</guid></item><item><title>睡眠有助于您的大脑为未来做好准备，现在我们知道如何做好准备- ScienceAlert | Sleep Helps Your Brain Prepare For The Future, And Now We Know How - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxQUXFBbWoxYjBvT0EzMW1CbWgyUWVhUlN6bnVkWGRraXdjYkc5bVZLTHJXaEVoM1k1N1BZZVlLczlienIxbFR1R01YT2QtWGstcHFPU09PRTNzUE5hdnRDV0R3N21tM2lBeWRaQ1p6UjhuRnRYWWMxS1Q0Wi1WR1Vxd1ZuWXVXeURvRlhYaThhekxSSkJMQzV2ZDJB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Not only must your brain maintain a vast archive of existing memories, but it also has to keep track of new stuff each day. That requires getting ready to deal with new memories before they occur, even while processing old ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's well-known that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sleep-almost-doubles-our-chances-of-remembering-forgotten-things-study-finds"&gt;sleep is important for memory&lt;/a&gt; and learning, among other things, but we're still figuring out many of the precise mechanisms involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, it's seen as a backwards-facing process: We experience something, the memory of it is then processed and preserved during subsequent nights of sleep, and we can recall it at will later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a new study, however, sleep seems to help us process not just past memories, but also future ones. In addition to consolidating and conserving memories while we sleep, the study suggests our brains are also actively preparing us to record upcoming events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory is a broad, multifaceted phenomenon that helps make us who we are, and from our subjective perspective it can seem almost magical, somehow beyond discrete components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not, though. At a cellular level, groups of specialized neurons known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engram_(neuropsychology)"&gt;engram cells&lt;/a&gt; physically encode our life experiences in a format we can recall later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has made it clear &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-more-about-how-the-brain-strengthens-memories-during-sleep"&gt;sleep is crucial&lt;/a&gt; for this process to work properly, but many physiological details remain unclear. On top of merely storing memories, our brains also perform incredible feats of processing and organization, much of which occurs during mental downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the new study, researchers in Japan sought to learn more about the role sleep plays in memory processing, including the preparation for memorable experiences that haven't happened yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ir0pT8grfI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors used an imaging system for freely moving mice that can reveal both engram and non-engram cells across the stages of memory processing. They were able to track neuronal activity before, during, and after memorable events the mice experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shed new light on the behavior of specific neuron populations under various cognitive conditions, including while mice slept both before and after learning experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results highlighted two parallel processes unfolding in post-learning slumber. First, engram cells that initially encoded a memory showed predictable reactivation patterns, part of the brain's well-documented procedure for consolidating memories during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed another interesting population of neurons, which weren't yet associated with specific memories. These "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58860-w"&gt;engram-to-be cells&lt;/a&gt;," as the researchers call them, grew increasingly synchronized as mice slept after learning. Later, the same neuron groups went on to encode new, different memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Engram-to-be cells exhibited increased coactivity with existing engram cells during sleep, suggesting that this interaction helps shape new memory networks," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1081734"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; co-author Kaoru Inokuchi, a professor of biochemistry at the University of Toyama in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also developed a neural network model to simulate activity in the hippocampus, hoping to further illuminate the underlying mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model pointed to synaptic &lt;span&gt;depression&lt;/span&gt; and scaling, phenomena known to modify neuronal connections during sleep, as likely important for organizing these engram-to-be cells – a service that dwindled in the model when those mechanisms were disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engram and engram-to-be cells showed intriguing co-activation in post-learning sleep, the study found, hinting at some coordination or even data transfer between the neural networks for past and upcoming memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests sleep quality between learning events may influence not only our retention of what we've learned so far, but also how well we'll retain new information in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While more research is needed, this could be valuable insight for education and treatment of memory disorders, and it could help uncover novel ways to help people maximize their cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We believe that manipulating brain activity during sleep or sleep patterns may uncover methods to enhance memory by unlocking the brain's latent potential," Inokuchi &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1081734"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all, however, these findings add to the mountain of existing evidence that we should all take sleep seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We want people to understand that sleep is not just about rest – it plays a crucial role in how the brain processes information," Inokuchi &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1081734"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. "With that in mind, we hope everyone will begin to value sleep more and use it as a way to improve their overall quality of life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58860-w"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Children who are routinely shamed, threatened, or belittled by adults may develop a hyperactive threat system and a blunted reward response, making trust and emotional regulation more difficult in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes affect not only emotional wellbeing but also a child’s ability to form healthy relationships and build self-worth. Experts emphasize that verbal abuse is preventable and call for greater public awareness and policy action to protect children’s mental and neurological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurodevelopmental Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Verbal abuse overactivates threat systems and dulls reward responses in children’s brains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Harm:&lt;/strong&gt; Early verbal abuse increases risks of anxiety, depression, and social dysfunction in adulthood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventable Harm:&lt;/strong&gt; Ending verbal abuse is critical for healthy brain development and long-term wellbeing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;The Conversation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harsh words can wound – and when directed at children, they can have a lifelong impact.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18692174/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20483374/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;has shown&lt;/a&gt; that when words are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24493840/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;routinely used&lt;/a&gt; by the adults in their lives to humiliate, shame or control children, they can alter the developing brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2023-072916" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; of over 20,500 UK adults found that one in five reported having been verbally abused as children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Definitions of verbal abuse vary, but it is generally characterised by a sustained pattern of behaviour where criticism, threats or rejection of the child leads them to feel routinely belittled, blamed, threatened, frightened or ridiculed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not the same as occasionally losing your temper with your children and saying something hurtful in the heat of the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I and colleagues believe this shapes how a child sees the world, others, and themselves. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140673608617067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Exposure to abuse&lt;/a&gt;, including verbal abuse, leads to an &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001349" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of anxiety, depression, suicide attempts and drug use in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has an impact on forming trusting relationships as an adult. Yet despite its devastating consequences, verbal abuse remains largely overlooked in public debate and policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preventing verbal abuse – along with all forms of child abuse and neglect – is more than just a moral imperative. It is essential for healthy brain development and lifelong wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Changes in the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was among the experts brought together by Jessica Bondy, founder of the Words Matter charity, in the House of Commons in April 2025 to discuss the prevention of childhood verbal abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a neuroscientist, I have spent decades using brain imaging to understand how early adversity and trauma, including verbal abuse, can shape a young person’s development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now know that emotional abuse, including consistently hostile or demeaning language from adults, can &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28295339/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;significantly alter&lt;/a&gt; the way a child’s brain perceives and reacts to the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several key brain systems are affected. For example, our threat system normally helps us stay safe by detecting danger and triggering a quick response – the well-known “fight or flight” reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in children subjected to frequent abuse, including verbal abuse, this system &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211011390?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;becomes hyperactive&lt;/a&gt;. Even neutral social cues – a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22258799/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;facial expression&lt;/a&gt;, or a joke or well-meaning comment – can be misinterpreted as threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verbal abuse also affects how children form relationships. In healthy development, warm verbal and non-verbal exchanges with caregivers – praise, compliments, thoughtful understanding – help teach children how to establish &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2920349/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;secure and healthy&lt;/a&gt; relationships. They also help them build self-worth and social confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But verbal abuse, along with other forms of childhood maltreatment, can blunt the brain’s reward system. The brain becomes less responsive to positive experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe that these brain adaptations can alter how a maltreated child builds their social world. They may help the child survive in an adverse social environment, but over time they accrue long-term costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It becomes harder to trust others; harder to navigate relationships; harder to believe you are of real value and truly lovable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Lifelong consequences&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By adulthood, the risk is that a repeated cycle of interpersonal stress and rupture &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35926524/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;is established&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21142355/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Romantic relationships&lt;/a&gt; can be destabilised by deep-seated fears of abandonment or rejection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those early wounds fold into our sense of self, creating an enduring lens through which the world is perceived. It can be a struggle to feel at ease in one own’s mind, or safe in the mind of another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to my research work at UCL, I am CEO of Anna Freud, a charity dedicated to transforming mental health support through evidence-based care, cutting-edge research, professional training and accessible resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our clinical work at Anna Freud, we have seen countless young people and adults struggle with the verbal messages they have received growing up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harsh language sticks because we are biologically wired to privilege negative and threatening information for our own protection. These verbal wounds underpin so much later anxiety, pain and distress. Adults can spend decades trying to compensate to prove those words wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to shine a light on the impact of verbal abuse, helping parents, carers, teachers and all adults in a child’s life understand the power of their words. This does not imply that poor behaviour should go unchecked; children still need clear limits and honest corrective feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it does mean creating environments – at home, at school, in communities – where children are spoken to with respect, encouragement and care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verbal abuse is not an inevitable part of growing up. It is preventable. And the science is clear: ending it is essential to safeguarding healthy brain development and improving life-long mental health outcomes. Society as a whole will benefit, with a new generation more likely to thrive in education and employment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to ensure every child is nurtured by words that build them up, not tear them down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurodevelopment and verbal abuse research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/eamon-mccrory-164142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eamon McCrory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Eamon McCrory – The Conversation&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/255533/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-advanced" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 16:06:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE9NOWFXd2RHZUl3QzZrNUVrTnB2UXM3VW13RGpkcGVfX2JFQnVKR1N0bWJNd1dtVHFGVllZTm1vLXlnOHBjdE9VTGpQSDgwZkxhYUo1MzZZLUNIVFFiVTJFS05FSHVMcmJUZ1dSYg</guid></item><item><title>5岁儿童可以使用成人大脑系统导航地图-神经科学新闻 | Five-Year-Olds Can Navigate Maps Using Adultlike Brain Systems - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE5VNG1wUEN2VUdKUFRNZ1pxYzVYZ3V4aktScTNhZm81X3FzWlMzSklWd1B6NlVsdnI2ZnYzVGJ1aldzNGtQTTc5YkIxWDlnRklnNG5UVDZnRnAzX0ZfaURlUGpTTzUwd0RjeVFaYkZ0cXhMb0U?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research shows that the brain region supporting map-based navigation is active in children as young as five years old. Using a child-friendly virtual environment called Tiny Town, researchers demonstrated that young children can build and mentally hold maps to guide navigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain scans confirmed that the retrosplenial complex—a region critical for spatial mapping in adults—was already functional in these young participants. The findings challenge previous beliefs that such cognitive abilities develop only after age 12 and shed light on the early emergence of complex spatial reasoning in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Navigation Ability:&lt;/strong&gt; Five-year-olds used brain systems to navigate using mental maps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RSC Activation:&lt;/strong&gt; The retrosplenial complex was active during map-based navigation tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virtual Town Test:&lt;/strong&gt; Children learned and recalled locations in a simplified digital town called Tiny Town.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Emory University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many behavioral studies suggest that using landmarks to navigate through large-scale spaces — known as map-based navigation — is not established until around age 12.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A neuroscience study at Emory University counters that assumption. Through experiments combining brain scans and a virtual environment the researchers dubbed Tiny Town, they showed that five-year-olds have the brain system that supports map-based navigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109783"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a child navigating a virtual city and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The Dilks lab is now doing a deeper dive into the question of how the brain develops the ability to recognize and move about the world by working on a protocol for toddlers. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The journal &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt; published the finding, the first neural evidence that this cognitive ability is in place in such young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While large-scale navigation abilities certainly continue to develop throughout childhood, our findings show that the underlying neural system is established remarkably early,” says Yaelan Jung, first author of the study and a postdoctoral fellow in Emory’s Department of Psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rather than taking a decade or more, map-based navigation is underway in half that time,” adds Daniel Dilks, associate professor of psychology and senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Five-year-olds have the brain system enabling them to find their way around a tiny, virtual town. They not only know that the ice cream store in the mountain region is different than the ice cream store in the lake region, they know how to navigate the streets to get to each of them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mapping the visual brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dilks is at the forefront of identifying specific functions of the visual cortex related to face, place and object processing — how we recognize and get around our world. He’s also pioneering methods to study the timeline for the development of these functions, from infancy to adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Two fundamental questions in neuroscience,” he explains, “are how knowledge is organized in the brain and the origins of that knowledge. In other words, what knowledge are you born with and how does knowledge develop as you grow?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology of fMRI offers a window into those questions. The harmless, noninvasive technique uses a giant magnet to scan the brain and record the magnetic properties in blood. It measures heightened blood flow to a brain region, indicating that region is more active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In adult studies during the past decade, the Dilks lab has showed that three scene-selective regions in the brain perform separate, non-overlapping, tasks.  The parahippocampal place area (PPA) allows us to recognize places and cluster them into categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retrosplenial complex (RSC) maps the places into their proper locations within a larger space, allowing us to navigate from one place to another. The occipital place area (OPA) allows us to walk around our immediate surroundings, not bumping into boundaries or other obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can’t fix most neurological problems right now,” Dilks says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But by continuing to learn more about how the brain develops and functions normally, we keep moving closer to being able to repair it when something goes wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking navigation versus map-based navigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Dilks and Jung discovered that the brain system for walking through the immediate environment, avoiding boundaries and obstacles, does not look adultlike until age 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It seems counterintuitive,” Dilks says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most children can walk before the age of two. And yet the brain system helping you walk around your immediate surroundings doesn’t start appearing adultlike until relatively late.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dilks and Jung had a theory that the seemingly more complex and sophisticated abilities of map-based navigation develop earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They noted that even before they can walk well, children are carried from room-to-room and taken in strollers from place-to-place, allowing them to essentially build up a map of their surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the current paper, they created experimental protocols for five-year-olds to test their theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They started with a virtual town known as Neuralville, developed by the Dilks lab for an adult study. It consists of eight buildings laid out on streets surrounding a town square and oriented by the four cardinal directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In tests with five-year-old participants registered with the Emory Child Study Center, Jung soon learned that Neuralville was a bit too complicated for them to navigate. She simplified the paradigm, turning it into a triangle, and called it Tiny Town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of cardinal directions, distinctive landscapes delineate each point of the triangle, including the mountain corner, the tree corner and the lake corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She created six structures for Tiny Town, including two each of categories generally of interest to children: ice cream stores, playgrounds and fire stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making science fun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing experiments with child participants requires creativity and patience, Jung says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to get at the scientific questions that we’re trying to answer,” she explains, “but it’s also important that a child who participates in a study has a good time. We want them to leave with a good impression of science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jung first familiarized a child to the virtual town using the arrow keys on a computer to move through its streets and arrive at different places. She then invited the child to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was fascinating that they were so good at it,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This familiarization was followed by tests of their knowledge. She showed still images of Tiny Town to a child and asked questions such as: Did you see this building in Tiny Town? Is it in the mountain corner?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the children passed this test and moved into the next phase: training for scanning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jung turned the training process into a game involving the children and adult lab members. An adult would point at the child and say, “Freeze!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The kids loved it! They especially liked to freeze the adults in the room,” Jung says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’d point at one of us and say, ‘It’s your turn now!’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers explained to the participants that the scanner was like a camera and they would need to hold perfectly still so their photo wasn’t blurry when they performed a task while in the machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The children were then trained to do the game-like task, pushing a button in response to paired images from Tiny Town. For instance, if an image of a particular fire station was shown with an image of mountains, they needed to push the button if this scenario mapped correctly onto Tiny Town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants practiced the task in a mock scanner before entering the real one for the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We gave them a blanket and a pillow to make it cozy and explained that they would be watching a movie in their own private theater,” Jung says. “They really liked that idea.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting data showed that five-year-olds can learn a map and hold it in their minds. And to do so, they used their RSC — the brain region specialized for coding the location of buildings in a map, allowing us to navigate from one place to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The icing on the cake is that everyone involved in the study — including the researchers — enjoyed the experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was really fun to work with the children,” Jung says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I learned that the age of five is a magical time to scan a child. They don’t tend to be afraid of new things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dilks lab is now doing a deeper dive into the question of how the brain develops the ability to recognize and move about the world by working on a protocol for toddlers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are proving a bigger challenge than infants and five-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Between the ages of two and three, children basically don’t listen to you,” says Jung, who is the mother of a three-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and her lab mates are trying out strategies involving a cardboard mockup of a scanner, cartoons and Cheerios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s fascinating to explore how humans use different parts of the brain for complex behaviors and how that changes with age and experiences,” Jung says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re laying the groundwork for clinical applications, including getting a better understanding of typical versus atypical neural development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this navigation and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#046765766b682a676865766f4461696b767d2a616071" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Carol Clark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://emory.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Emory University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Carol Clark – Emory University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2503569122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Early development of navigationally relevant location information in the retrosplenial complex&lt;/a&gt;” by Yaelan Jung et al. &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early development of navigationally relevant location information in the retrosplenial complex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representing the locations of places so that we can use them as landmarks is critical to our ability to navigate through large-scale spaces—a process referred to as “map-based navigation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many neuroimaging studies in adults have revealed that this ability involves the retrosplenial complex (RSC)—a scene-selective region in the medial parietal cortex—nothing is known about how this cortical system develops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, does it develop only late in childhood, as generally assumed from some behavioral studies? Or is it, perhaps counterintuitively, present in the first few years of life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this question, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) multivoxel pattern analysis and a virtual town paradigm, we investigated the representation of location information in the RSC of 5-y-olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that i) the RSC in 5-y-olds already represents the locations of particular buildings in the town (e.g., the ice cream store by the mountain versus by the lake), but not their category membership (e.g., ice cream store, regardless of location), and ii) this neural representation is correlated with their performance on a location task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using multidimensional scaling, we also found that the neural representation of the buildings in RSC reflects the actual layout of the virtual town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the parahippocampal place area—a scene-selective region implicated in scene categorization, not map-based navigation—did not represent location information, but instead category information, the exact opposite of RSC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these findings reveal the early development of navigationally relevant location information in RSC and thus the early origins of map-based navigation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This competition isn’t just accelerating progress, it’s shattering the limits of what’s possible when it comes to ageing,” said Jamie Justice, the executive director of XPrize, run by the XPrize Foundation and backed by funders including the Hevolution Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The winning team should be able to restore these three systems by a minimum of 10 – but ideally 20 – years in humans aged 50 to 80. A key condition of the final prize is that the innovation is accessible to as many people as cheaply and easily as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Another condition is that there will be no delay in rolling out the solution: the winning idea must be scalable in 12 months or less of the final award being made in 2030, after a final $81m one-year clinical trial in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Success will profoundly change our approach to ageing and positively affect quality of life and healthcare costs,” Justice said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;XPrize is not the only multimillion-dollar prize on offer to those striving to come up with an answer to ageing: the Saudi-backed Hevolution Foundation has pledged $1bn to fund longevity research, clinical trials and global collaborations over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The Methuselah Mouse prize (Mprize) has committed more than $4.5m to extend the lifespan of mice as a proxy for delaying human ageing. The Rejuvenation Startup Challenge awards $2-3m to support startups with promising rejuvenation technologies. The Palo Alto longevity prize offers $1m to extend lifespan in mammals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;All these prizes are devised to address the fact that while global life expectancy has more than doubled in the last 100 years, the quality of our health as we age has stalled. There are enormous gaps around the world between life expectancy and healthy life expectancy: in the UK, women can expect to live up to 22 years in poor health. Men live on average 17 years with chronic illness, disability or reduced quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The aim of XPrize is not to develop cutting-edge therapeutics. “The standout aim is to redefine our approach to extending the healthy, quality years of human life,” Justice said. “The winning intervention will not be disease-specific and reactive, like modern medicine. Instead, it will target the mechanisms of biological ageing itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“That will propel our ability to address physical and cognitive functional decline, enhance resilience in the face of illness or disease, and ultimately delay the onset of disability and death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;On Monday, the biggest prize in the longevity field comes closer as 40 semi-finalist teams are pulled from the XPrize longlist, which comprised more than 1,000 scientists, clinicians, biomedical engineers, longevity technology leaders, pharmaceutical companies, students, biohacker groups and newcomers to the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;These teams – 14 of which come from the UK – have suggested a wide range of innovations including pharmacological approaches, biological therapies and lifestyle-based interventions, and often combinations of all three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A common focus of solutions is to regenerate or maintain cellular and tissue function over time through biologics such as stem cell therapy. Immunotherapies and seeking to reverse age-related gene change at the molecular level are another approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;New or repurposed drugs are frequently posited as solutions by the competing teams, including metformin and rapamycin, for both of which funding has long been sought to clinically prove what many hope will be a breakthrough in anti-ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Of the devices proposed, most focus on electrical stimulation of neural pathways, neuromuscular activation or muscle maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;No matter how technologically advanced the oncoming solutions, Justice says nothing will replace diet and exercise – albeit highly personalised and specific techniques – as the central element in healthy ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We’re not talking about your five a day here,” she said. “While wholefoods and supplements are the most commonly proposed nutritional solutions from our teams, they’re often suggested in combination with substances like nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a naturally occurring molecule that is gaining attention as a potential anti-ageing agent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Nutraceuticals – foods that offer health benefits beyond their nutritional value – also feature, with a focus on wheatgrass, seaweed, berries, proteins, amino acids, herbal products and metabolism-supporting compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Lifestyle and behavioural approaches are also prominent, often combined with cognitive training, sleep optimisation and community engagement. The most frequent combinations include aerobic and resistance exercise with dietary changes, as well as sleep health paired with meditation, prayer or breathing exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 15:13:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxPd0d6M3Q3bmxBNjZaZWVPb2IzUzRhNlJ0Y21hNTZTcmRxaVp1YjBsR0k1RXFwSzdJSlV3WUpfMmxTZ0RJZ0NvU2N4X29GMEViRTNyYWRfN0NDNXE0NTJ6N3BvZlZ2cU5PV1JaWFAyRUlKUUZPT0dzenVsSFZwRFpmZUN4UEw1YVgtRWNibXo0Nm5fa0t6ZXJVS0VKYjljc1FZR0toOQ</guid></item><item><title>青少年肥胖与记忆和情绪中心的大脑变化有关-神经科学新闻 | Teen Obesity Linked to Brain Changes in Memory and Emotion Centers - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE5qZDlUdnpKZk83M1lhRWlENlJjNE9TVDlSNGlwSFNwMjVtV1FlZ1FESWkyUGJ4d1hIWnBWc2ZQMUFEa1BBNDBRVERXUW5oWlBMdU5jWlo4cUN5aENBVy1vaXAwRFRnUWpPV0pRRzVCMXU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A major new study shows that adolescents with abdominal obesity have significantly larger brain regions involved in memory and emotional regulation, raising concerns about how obesity affects brain development. MRI scans revealed that the hippocampus and amygdala were enlarged in teens with obesity, especially those with high waist-to-height ratios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that youth from lower-opportunity neighborhoods had reduced brain development, with disparities even more pronounced among those with persistent abdominal obesity. Researchers warn that both under- and overgrowth in these brain areas may disrupt normal cognitive and emotional functioning, potentially increasing long-term risks for mental health issues and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Growth Disruption:&lt;/strong&gt; Obese teens had a 6.6% larger hippocampus and 4.3% larger amygdala.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; The amygdala was most affected in teens with high abdominal fat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Inequality:&lt;/strong&gt; Lower-opportunity environments worsened brain development outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;European Society for the Study of Obesity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Several areas of the brain, including regions that play a critical role in learning and memory and in the control of emotions, are larger in adolescents who are living with obesity, new research being presented at the European Congress on Obesity (ECO 2025) has found.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding, from a study of thousands of teenagers in the US, raises concerns that obesity affects not only physical health but also learning, memory and control of emotions, says lead researcher Dr. Augusto César F. De Moraes, of UTHealth Houston School of Public Health in Austin, Department of Epidemiology, Texas, U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is particularly alarming, given that the teenage years are such an important time for brain development,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109779"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and junk food." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Obesity—particularly abdominal obesity—has been linked to changes in brain development in the past, with regions key to cognition and the regulation of emotions seemingly particularly vulnerable. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The percentage of children and adolescents worldwide who are living with obesity more than quadrupled among girls (from 1.7% to 6.9%) and among boys (from 2.1% to 9.3%) between 1990 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US, it is estimated that more than one in three children aged 5 to 14 (36.2% of boys and 37.2% of girls) are living with overweight or obesity—equating to more than 15 million children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity—particularly abdominal obesity—has been linked to changes in brain development in the past, with regions key to cognition and the regulation of emotions seemingly particularly vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health inequalities like poor access to quality education, safe neighborhoods and healthy food are well-known contributors to physical health problems—but their role in brain development and cognition is often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find out more about how obesity and health inequalities affect brain structure and cognition, Dr. De Moraes and colleagues in the US, Brazil, and Spain analyzed data from 3,320 participants in the ABCD study, an ongoing study into how childhood experiences affect brain development and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were recruited from cities in 17 states and followed for four years, from 2016–2018 to 2020–2022. (For list of cities, see notes to editors.) The average age of participants at baseline was 9.9 years and 47.4% were girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were categorized based on obesity status, with further stratification by abdominal obesity (measured using waist circumference). At baseline, approximately 34.6% of participants were classified as having abdominal obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structural MRI scans assessed the volume of several brain regions of the brain’s subcortex, including the amygdala, hippocampus, caudate, accumbens, pallidum, putamen and thalamus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health disparities were assessed using the Child Opportunity Index, which measures a child’s opportunities via the quality of neighborhood features such as education, walkability and access to healthy food and green space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several of the brain regions were larger in adolescents with abdominal obesity than in their peers without abdominal obesity. The biggest changes were seen in the hippocampus, which is involved in memory and learning, and the amygdala, which regulates, or controls, emotions, including fear, happiness, anger and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus was approximately 6.6% larger and the amygdala was about 4.3% larger in teens with abdominal obesity compared to those without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amygdala was particularly large in teenagers with very high levels of abdominal fat (a waist-to-height ratio over 0.5). This raises concerns that excess body fat affects how the brain handles emotions, say the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thalamus (which relays information about movement, hearing, taste, sight and touch) and caudate (which helps control movement) showed smaller increases in size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that teens from lower-opportunity areas showed reduced development in key brain regions, such as the hippocampus, putamen and amygdala, compared with their peers in higher-opportunity areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This difference was even more pronounced among adolescents with persistent abdominal obesity,” says Dr. De Moraes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It highlights the urgent need to address both social inequality and health risks to support not only physical well-being but also healthy brain development in youth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors explain that in the context of the young developing brain, both decreased and increased growth can cause harm. Thus, having lower-than-normal brain development, as shown in the teens in lower-opportunity areas, or larger-than-normal parts of the brain due to inflammation caused by obesity, can both be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. De Moraes concludes, “Our findings suggest that obesity, particularly abdominal obesity, can impair teenagers’ learning, memory and control of emotions. I worry about how these changes, which are occurring at the age of 13 or 14, might affect them later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s even a chance they could be a higher risk of things like memory problems or dementia as they get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s why we believe supporting healthier habits early on is so important, not just for physical health, but for brain health too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Treating and preventing adolescent obesity won’t only improve health—it may improve brain health, too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this obesity, neurodevelopment, and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://easo.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Augusto César F.

&lt;p&gt;Under the haze of anesthesia, some patients undergoing surgery experience something you wouldn’t expect in this tense setting — vivid, sometimes disturbing sexual fantasies. In rare but striking cases, these dreams and hallucinations have blurred the lines between reality and delusion, leaving behind confusion, distress, and in some instances, legal fallout.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A growing body of literature is shedding light on an unsettling phenomenon: certain sedative and hypnotic drugs, especially those used in anesthesia, can provoke sexual hallucinations. These are not idle daydreams. They unfold with startling clarity, often in a logical sequence, and some patients recall them with an eerie sense of certainty.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/assets_task_01jttpmbj2frqv015dnxj9q9yg_1746800445_img_0.webp"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/assets_task_01jttpmbj2frqv015dnxj9q9yg_1746800445_img_0-1024x683.webp" alt="A higher percentage of men interpreted the hallucinations as being pleasurable while most women often felt them like assault" class="wp-image-283314" srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/assets_task_01jttpmbj2frqv015dnxj9q9yg_1746800445_img_0-1024x683.webp 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/assets_task_01jttpmbj2frqv015dnxj9q9yg_1746800445_img_0-750x500.webp 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/assets_task_01jttpmbj2frqv015dnxj9q9yg_1746800445_img_0-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/assets_task_01jttpmbj2frqv015dnxj9q9yg_1746800445_img_0.webp 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A higher percentage of men interpreted the hallucinations as being pleasurable while most women often described them as assault. Image generated using Sora/ChatGPT&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-hidden-side-effect"&gt;A Hidden Side Effect&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sedatives most commonly linked to these hallucinations include benzodiazepines like midazolam and diazepam, as well as propofol, ketamine, nitrous oxide, and even older agents like ether and chloroform. Most of these drugs act on GABA, a neurotransmitter that slows brain activity and induces relaxation — but in certain doses, they seem to open a peculiar erotic window into the subconscious.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A recent blog post published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-brain-on-food/202505/several-sedative-drugs-may-give-you-sexual-fantasies"&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; described &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36895011/"&gt;87 published cases&lt;/a&gt; of drug-induced sexual hallucinations. About 41% involved midazolam or diazepam, often at high doses. Patients have recounted everything from fleeting sexual dreams to distressing hallucinations of assault.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34552212/"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;of 110 dental surgery patients, 13.6% reported experiencing sexual arousal, dreams, or hallucinations during or after anesthesia. Most described them as dreams. But 10 percent reported sexual visions that were unpleasant and lingered into recovery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sex of the medical team appeared to matter. In a report of roughly 300 male patients undergoing urological surgery, none reported sexual dreams when the team was all male. But when a female anesthesiologist was present, at least one patient did — and declined to elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Women also reported these episodes, though differently. In a group of 130 female patients sedated with propofol and alfentanil, 12% showed amorous or disinhibited behaviors. Some patients later described these episodes as hallucinations. Others simply remembered feelings of exposure or vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-real-feelings-imagined-events"&gt;Real Feelings, Imagined Events&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2136615/"&gt;A study&lt;/a&gt; from 1990 documented 41 incidents of women experiencing fantasies during sedation with intravenous midazolam or diazepam. Twenty-seven involved a sexual element, and twenty were described as unpleasant. These were not vague impressions. The events “occurred in a logical sequence and all were certain of their authenticity,” the study reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But here lies the disquieting twist: of 25 verified patient reports regarding occurrences during sedation, 17 turned out not to have occurred. In some of the remaining cases, the fantasies mirrored actual procedures or gestures, but with altered meanings. For instance, the pressure of a surgical swab might be reimagined as inappropriate touching.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The events felt real,” noted one researcher, “but independent witnesses confirmed they did not happen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such hallucinations have spurred legal complaints, often against health care providers who were later found to have done nothing wrong. The study concluded that “during or following sedation, lady patients should not be treated or examined without the presence of a responsible third person.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The question remains: why do some people experience these fantasies under sedation?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-their-chemical-romance"&gt;Their Chemical Romance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers point to the drugs’ actions on neurotransmitters like GABA and dopamine. Benzodiazepines and propofol, for example, enhance GABA’s calming effects. But in high doses, these effects may disinhibit certain brain regions — allowing suppressed thoughts or emotions to surface in exaggerated or distorted forms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some dopamine-enhancing drugs, such as those used for Parkinson’s disease or ADHD, have also triggered libido surges or sexual fantasies. Antipsychotics and antidepressants — especially those altering dopamine pathways — have been implicated too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRfidJNts6U&amp;amp;pp=ygUPa2V0YW1pbmUgZHJlYW1z"&gt;Ketamine&lt;/a&gt;, a dissociative anesthetic now also used in depression treatment, has caused some patients to experience graphic or distressing sexual visions. “One patient stated she would not undergo anesthesia again if ketamine was used,” a review found. During the Vietnam War, soldiers sedated with ketamine sometimes emerged with hallucinations of sexual assault — a phenomenon known as emergent psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Importantly, men were more likely to report fantasies, and often found them pleasurable. Women, however, reported more hallucinations resembling assault, and were more likely to find them disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-calling-saul"&gt;Calling Saul&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For health care professionals, these findings carry both clinical and ethical implications. The hallucinations, while rare, are vivid and potentially traumatizing. Some patients, believing the visions were real, have discontinued care or filed complaints.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Although such sexual hallucinations and fantasies are rare, the vivid recollection of the patient’s experiences should be recognized and acknowledged,” the review warned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts now recommend that clinicians inform patients — especially those receiving high-dose sedatives — that such hallucinations are possible. They also urge protective protocols, like ensuring a witness is present, or using video monitoring, particularly during sensitive procedures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even if the events never happened, the emotional scars can be real.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One woman, after receiving sufentanil, propofol, and midazolam for a routine procedure, described a compelling urge to show the medical team a private tattoo — a hallucination she later found deeply distressing. Though no one had touched her inappropriately, the sense of violation lingered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As powerful as they are, sedatives don’t just quiet the mind — they sometimes unmoor it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, these drugs have made invasive procedures less painful and more bearable. Midazolam and diazepam, in particular, are considered among the safest short-term sedatives in medicine. But safety isn’t everything. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What happens under sedation may stay in the mind long after the drugs have worn off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Some events,” as the 1990 paper put it, “are very real to the patient — and yet, on the evidence of two or more independent witnesses, did not occur.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That contradiction makes these hallucinations especially thorny (I said thorny). The memories may be false, but the emotions they carry are not. And in medicine, that distinction matters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;                                        &lt;p&gt;A rare genetic mutation might be the reason why some 'lucky' individuals are able to function well despite only managing four to six hours of sleep at night, a new study has claimed. This mutation affects the sleep-wake cycle, leading to less sleep and potentially more deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors usually recommend at least seven to nine hours of sleep each night, with sleep deprivation in individuals linked to conditions such as Alzheimer's and heart disease. However, the study findings, published in the journal &lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2500356122" rel="noindex,nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suggest that not everyone with a shorter sleep cycle had underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our bodies continue to work when we go to bed. These people [natural short sleepers], all these functions our bodies are doing while we are sleeping, they can just perform at a higher level than we can," study co-author Ying-Hui Fu, a neuroscientist and geneticist at the University of California, was quoted as saying by&lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/sleep/rare-genetic-mutation-lets-some-people-thrive-on-just-4-hours-of-shut-eye" rel="noindex,nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt; LiveScience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study identified one of these mutations, named SIK3-N783Y, in a human super-sleeper. Afterwards, the team studied the mutation in genetically modified mice and found that the rodent also got less sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that mice with the mutation slept around 31 minutes less than those without it, and 54 minutes less following a period of sleep deprivation, which was induced through gentle handling of the mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="v-ndtv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In a mouse model, the presence of the NSS hSIK3-N783Y mutation leads to a decrease in sleep time and an increase in EEG delta power."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/man-dumps-girlfriend-after-her-phone-automatically-connects-to-hotel-wi-fi-8387664" rel="noindex,nofollow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also Read | Man Dumps Girlfriend After Her Phone Automatically Connects To Hotel Wi-Fi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists added that the mutation caused structural changes affecting the protein's ability to transfer key phosphate molecules to other proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research said the study findings could lead to new therapies for sleep disorders and improve sleep quality in individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Further data analyses reveal additional kinases that could participate in the modulating network for sleep duration."&lt;/p&gt;

In mice, researchers found “goal-progress cells” that fire based on how far along the animal is in a behavioral task, enabling them to infer what comes next even in novel scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cells create internal maps of behavior rather than physical environments, allowing for flexible, generalised thinking. The discovery sheds light on how the brain supports everyday problem-solving and may inform future advances in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal-Progress Cells:&lt;/strong&gt; Neurons in the cortex track behavioral sequences, not spatial position.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond Memory:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice inferred task structure without prior exposure, showing true generalization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological AI Bridge:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings help connect brain function to adaptable AI systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;The Conversation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For decades, neuroscientists have developed mathematical frameworks to explain how brain activity drives behaviour in predictable, repetitive scenarios, such as while playing a game. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These algorithms have not only described brain cell activity &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627320304682" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;with remarkable precision&lt;/a&gt; but also helped develop artificial intelligence with superhuman achievements in specific tasks, such as playing Atari or Go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109775"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a head and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The behaviour we compose to reach our goals is replete with repetition. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet these frameworks fall short of capturing the essence of human and animal behaviour: our extraordinary ability to generalise, infer and adapt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08145-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; late last year, provides insights into how brain cells in mice enable this more complex, intelligent behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike machines, humans and animals can flexibly navigate new challenges. Every day, we solve new problems by generalising from our knowledge or drawing from our experiences. We cook new recipes, meet new people, take a new path – and we can imagine the aftermath of entirely novel choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was in the mid-20th century that psychologist Edward Tolman described &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1949-00103-001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the concept of “cognitive maps”&lt;/a&gt;. These are internal, mental representations of the world that organise our experiences and allow us to predict what we’ll see next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting in the 1970s, researchers identified &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0006899371903581" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;a beautiful system of specialised cells&lt;/a&gt; in the hippocampus (the brain’s memory centre) and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;entorhinal cortex&lt;/a&gt; (an area that deals with memory, navigation, and time perception) in rodents that form a literal map of our environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include “place cells”, which fire at specific locations, and “grid cells” that create a spatial framework. Together, these and a host of other neurons encode distances, goals and locations, forming a precise mental map of the physical world and where we are within it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now our attention has turned to other areas of cognition beyond finding our way around generalisation, inference, imagination, social cognition and memory. The same areas of the brain that help us navigate in space are also involved in these functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cells for generalising?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We wanted to know if there are cells that organise the knowledge of our behaviour, rather than the outside world, and how they work. Specifically, what are the algorithms that underlie the activity of brain cells as we generalise from past experience? How do we rustle up that new pasta dish?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we did find such cells. There are neurons that tell us “where we are” in a sequence of behaviour (we haven’t named the cells).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To uncover the brain cells, networks and algorithms that perform these roles, we studied mice, training the animals to complete a task. The task had a sequence of actions with a repeating structure. Mice moved through four locations, or “goals”, containing a water reward (A, B, C and D) in loops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we moved the location of the goals, the mice were able to infer what came next in the sequence – even when they had never experienced that exact scenario before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When mice reached goal D in a new location for the first time, they immediately knew to return to goal A. This wasn’t memory, because they’d never encountered it. Instead, it shows that the mice understood the general structure of the task and tracked their position within it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice had electrodes implanted into the brain, which allowed us to capture neural activity during the task. We found that specific cells in the cortex (the outermost layer of the brain) collectively mapped the animal’s goal progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, one cell could fire when the animal was 70% of the way to its goal, regardless of where the goal was or how far away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some cells tracked progress towards immediate subgoals – like chopping vegetables in our cooking analogy – while others mapped progress towards the overall goal, such as finishing the meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these goal progress cells created a system that gave our location in behavioural space rather than a physical space. Crucially, the system is flexible and can be updated if the task changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This encoding allows the brain to predict the upcoming sequence of actions without relying on simple associative memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Common experiences&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why should the brain bother to learn general structural representations of tasks? Why not create a new representation for each one? For generalisation to be worthwhile, the tasks we complete must contain regularities that can be exploited — and they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The behaviour we compose to reach our goals is replete with repetition. Generalisation allows knowledge to extend beyond individual instances. Throughout life, we encounter a highly structured distribution of tasks. And each day we solve new problems by generalising from past experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A previous encounter with making bolognese can inform a new ragu recipe, because the same general steps apply to both (such as starting with frying onions and adding fresh herbs at the end).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We propose that the goal-progress cells in the cortex serve as the building blocks – internal frameworks that organise abstract relationships between events, actions and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we’ve only shown this in mice, it is plausible that the same thing happens in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By documenting these cellular networks and the algorithms that underlie them, we are building new bridges between human and animal neuroscience, and between biological and artificial intelligence.

A wealth of findings is beginning to reveal the algorithms that we use to map the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the biological algorithms that map the complex structured behaviours that we compose to reach our goals remain unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we reveal a neuronal implementation of an algorithm for mapping abstract behavioural structure and transferring it to new scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We trained mice on many tasks that shared a common structure (organizing a sequence of goals) but differed in the specific goal locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice discovered the underlying task structure, enabling zero-shot inferences on the first trial of new tasks. The activity of most neurons in the medial frontal cortex tiled progress to goal, akin to how place cells map physical space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These ‘goal-progress cells’ generalized, stretching and compressing their tiling to accommodate different goal distances. By contrast, progress along the overall sequence of goals was not encoded explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, a subset of goal-progress cells was further tuned such that individual neurons fired with a fixed task lag from a particular behavioural step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these cells acted as task-structured memory buffers, implementing an algorithm that instantaneously encoded the entire sequence of future behavioural steps, and whose dynamics automatically computed the appropriate action at each step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These dynamics mirrored the abstract task structure both on-task and during offline sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that schemata of complex behavioural structures can be generated by sculpting progress-to-goal tuning into task-structured buffers of individual behavioural steps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/254233/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-advanced" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 14:24:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE9XcGZqdXdLY3BwaUZab3B3UU41RER3ZnpWbTRBNERwTkh3c2tzd3RPcGRveUFjTWZoYkVDN1ZMbFlLdDNfOUVTbmMzQXVzQnZTZ0F6d2JCODJZdGZoUUdxeWhqenJXRTE3eXhzTHE0SEZ1b2RlNlE</guid></item><item><title>中国科学家鉴定出有可能减缓神经系统疾病的药用真菌- Earth.com | Chinese scientists identify medicinal fungi with potential to slow down nervous system diseases - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxQM2lRdWlCRWdHZjhhRDFTd3ZoQ1hJQ1VTTk5yV0tMck1tMmpRaDdjLTF4M0ZnZTc4NU9FeVNxcmhrQldqYmdENVNQYnhBM3A0Qy1DdlpyNTJ6YUwzYXdUOXlKakJxRHJzVW42dmt2ejZOU1dacWZEcm92dE9TQmwyMmNnYTgzU1cwYU9tN0JSU3E1SW1rR2E1R3RkOS1feGx6RUd4NE8teEk0SHlHQjdzMU0wUTJyQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in China have been looking into several species of medicinal fungi to find new ways to address problems of the central nervous system, where conditions like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases affect millions of people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiaoqian-Liu-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Yang Liu&lt;/a&gt;, from a Shandong-based research group, emphasizes that these mushrooms have long been used in Chinese medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s recent findings suggest that bioactive ingredients found in several fungi may support brain function without causing burdensome side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-bioactive-components"&gt;Understanding bioactive components&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these fungi contain &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/polysaccharide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;polysaccharides&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/triterpenoid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;triterpenoids&lt;/a&gt;, and other active compounds. These components have caught attention for their potential to aid normal nerve functioning in older adults. They may also help ease oxidative damage in brain tissue by scavenging free radicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fungal-diseases-that-infect-humans-are-becoming-more-common-in-warming-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;fungal extracts&lt;/a&gt; appear to reduce harmful inflammation. That matters because chronic inflammatory reactions in the brain can lead to diminished thinking skills and worsen certain diseases of the nervous system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By restraining the overproduction of pro-inflammatory substances, fungi may help maintain a steadier internal environment for nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-aging-populations-raise-the-stakes"&gt;How aging populations raise the stakes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As people live longer, the number of those affected by diseases of the nervous system is expected to rise sharply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age is one of the biggest risk factors for conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/17-year-old-man-breaks-the-world-record-for-early-onset-alzheimers-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/pesticide-exposure-increases-the-risk-of-parkinsons-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt;, which makes prevention and early support more important than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This current trend is pushing scientists to find solutions that don’t rely solely on synthetic drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many older adults prefer natural options with fewer side effects, and medicinal mushrooms could offer one such path if their benefits continue to be confirmed through research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-these-fungi-stand-out"&gt;Why these fungi stand out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern pharmaceuticals for diseases of the nervous system often work on specific symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet they don’t always slow the actual progression of conditions like Alzheimer’s. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5987239/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Scientists&lt;/a&gt; suspect some mushrooms could do more than manage symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early findings hint at better antioxidant protection and improved cellular cleanup processes, which are vital for the brain’s long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31460832/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; also note that certain fungi support a balanced &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/gut-bacteria-influence-our-social-behavior-and-sense-of-fairness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;intestinal microbiome&lt;/a&gt;. The microbiome influences health beyond digestion by affecting how the body regulates mood, memory, and inflammatory signals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A healthy gut environment often aligns with greater mental sharpness, which is why the microbiome has turned into a hotspot for brain-related research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-research-shaping-potential-therapies"&gt;Research shaping potential therapies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extracts of species such as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92757/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ganoderma lucidum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have drawn a lot of interest for their neuroprotective properties. They appear to regulate immune cell activity in ways that safeguard fragile neurons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, compounds from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667142523000143" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cordyceps militaris&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; seem promising in stroke and Parkinson’s models, possibly due to their ability to moderate excessive inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tests in laboratory models indicate these mushrooms can be gentle on the body. When used with standard treatments, they might help patients manage symptoms while protecting nerve cells against oxidative harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efforts are now underway to transform these natural agents into standardized preparations that could be easier for people to incorporate into daily regimens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-turning-lab-results-into-real-solutions"&gt;Turning lab results into real solutions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical researchers are still exploring which precise compounds in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-species-of-glowing-mushrooms-discovered-mycena-crocata/"&gt;mushrooms&lt;/a&gt; can cross the blood-brain barrier. That information matters for designing targeted therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get there, advanced tools like mass spectrometry and molecular modeling are helping identify the relevant components. After verifying safety and purity, scientists will need to track long-term outcomes in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceutical and food industries are keen to develop mushroom-based products that are convenient to consume. Capsules, powders, and functional beverages could all become options in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although these ideas are still in development, initial patents and prototypes have started to appear, reflecting the potential for more widespread use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exploring-safety-and-public-trust"&gt;Exploring safety and public trust&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before mushroom-based therapies can gain traction, people want to know they’re safe. Although many of these &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hundreds-of-fungi-species-are-threatened-with-extinction/"&gt;fungi&lt;/a&gt; have been consumed for centuries in traditional medicine, formal clinical testing is needed to confirm their safety in concentrated forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are calling for long-term toxicity studies and more trials in diverse human populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would help build public trust and ease the concerns of doctors and health regulators who are cautious about introducing natural compounds without thorough vetting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-challenges-and-hopes"&gt;Challenges and hopes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people worry about taking unregulated supplements, and that is where standards come in. Researchers and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/your-twenties-can-make-or-break-your-heart-health/"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; agencies alike stress the importance of careful quality checks, especially as more individuals look to nontraditional therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By setting guidelines for dosage and composition, consumers could gain safer access to these mushrooms’ useful attributes.

After just three nights of sleeping four hours per night, healthy young men showed increased levels of proteins associated with heart failure and coronary artery disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While exercise still triggered beneficial proteins, the heart may face greater strain when sleep is lacking. These findings highlight the critical role of sleep in heart health, even in otherwise healthy individuals, and suggest that sleep and exercise should be viewed as complementary, not interchangeable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Just 3 nights of poor sleep elevated inflammation-related proteins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; Heart risk markers increased even in young, healthy individuals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise Helps, But Not Enough:&lt;/strong&gt; Physical activity can’t fully offset sleep loss effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Uppsala University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even a few nights with insufficient sleep promote molecular mechanisms linked to a greater risk of heart problems. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been shown in a new study in which the researchers investigated how sleep deprivation affects biomarkers (in this case proteins) associated with cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was led from Uppsala University and is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Biomarker Research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109768"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a person sleeping and a heart." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers have previously shown that exercise in the presence of sleep deprivation can result in a slightly increased load on the heart’s muscle cells. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, nearly half of all Swedes regularly experience disturbed sleep, and this is particularly common among shift workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That is why we wanted to try to identify mechanisms that affect how lack of sleep can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Ultimately, the purpose was to identify opportunities to address these problems,” says Jonathan Cedernaes, physician and docent at Uppsala University, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A chronic lack of sleep is a growing public health problem and in large population studies it has been linked to an increased risk of heart attack, stroke and atrial fibrillation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart health is influenced by several lifestyle factors, including sleep, diet and exercise. In order to separate out the effects of sleep, a number of conditions were controlled in the laboratory environment such as diet and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the study was conducted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors studied 16 healthy young men of normal weight. They all had healthy sleep habits. The participants spent time in a sleep laboratory where their meals and activity levels were strictly controlled in two sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one session, participants got a normal amount of sleep for three consecutive nights, while during the other session, they got only about four hours of sleep each night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During both sessions, morning and evening blood samples were taken, and following high-intensity exercise lasting 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammatory proteins increased after sleep loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers measured the levels of around 90 proteins in the blood and were able to see that the levels of many of these that are associated with increased inflammation rose when the participants were sleep-deprived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these proteins have already been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease such as heart failure and coronary artery disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many of the larger studies that have been done on the link between sleep deprivation and the risk of cardiovascular diseases have generally focused on slightly older individuals who already have an increased risk of such diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That is why it was interesting that the levels of these proteins increased in the same way in younger and previously perfectly healthy individuals after only a few nights of sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This means that it’s important to emphasise the importance of sleep for cardiovascular health even early in life,” says Jonathan Cedernaes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The effects of exercise can be affected by lack of sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical exercise generated a slightly different response after lack of sleep. However, a number of key proteins increased equally, whether the person was sleep-deprived or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, proteins that can be linked to the positive effects of exercise increased, even if the person had too little sleep. The researchers have previously shown that exercise in the presence of sleep deprivation can result in a slightly increased load on the heart’s muscle cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With this study, we have improved our understanding of what role the amount of sleep we get plays in cardiovascular health. It’s important to point out that studies have also shown that physical exercise can offset at least some of the negative effects that poor sleep can cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it’s also important to note that exercise cannot replace the essential functions of sleep,” says Jonathan Cedernaes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Further research is needed to investigate how these effects might differ in women, older individuals, patients with heart disease, or those with different sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our ongoing research will hopefully help to develop better guidelines on how sleep, exercise and other lifestyle factors can be harnessed to better prevent cardiovascular diseases,” says Jonathan Cedernaes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was carried out in collaboration with researchers at Akershus University Hospital and Sahlgrenska University Hospital, and was supported by the Swedish Society for Medical Research (SSMF), the Göran Gustafsson Foundation, the Swedish Diabetes Foundation, and &lt;em&gt;Hjärnfonden&lt;/em&gt; (the Swedish Brain Foundation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and cardiovascular disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6401080d0a4a0605070f1710160b092411114a1701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Elin Bäckström&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uu.se" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Uppsala University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Elin Bäckström – Uppsala University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40364-025-00776-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Overlooked Trio: Sleep Duration, Sampling Time and Physical Exercise Alter Levels of Olink-Assessed Blood Biomarkers of Cardiovascular Risk&lt;/a&gt;” by Jonathan Cedernaes et al. &lt;em&gt;Biomarker Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overlooked Trio: Sleep Duration, Sampling Time and Physical Exercise Alter Levels of Olink-Assessed Blood Biomarkers of Cardiovascular Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biomarker profiling from biofluids such as blood are widely measured in clinical research, using for example Olink proteomics panels. One such research focus area is cardiovascular disease (CVD), for which chronic sleep restriction (SR) is a risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it remains unclear whether blood levels of commonly measured CVD biomarkers are sensitive to acute dynamic factors such as SR, physical exercise (PEx), and time of day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this crossover design, 16 normal-weight, healthy men underwent three highly standardized in-lab nights of SR (4.25 h/night) and normal sleep (NS, 8.5 h/night) in randomized order, with 88 CVD blood protein biomarkers quantified using the Olink technology (and selected validation using ELISA) in the morning, evening, and immediately before and repeatedly after 30 min of high-intensity exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found significant time-of-day-dependent changes in several CVD biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas several proteins were exercise-induced across sleep conditions (such as the canonical exerkines IL- 6 and BDNF), exercise-induced proteomic dynamics differed in response to recurrent SR, compared with following NS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, SR compared with NS resulted in a biomarker profile previously associated with increased prospective risk of several CVDs across large-scale cohorts (such as higher circulating levels of IL-27 and LGALS9). Our findings highlight how dynamic physiology can modulate CVD biomarker levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results also underscore the need to consider sleep duration as a key determinant of cardiovascular health—an emphasis reflected in recent American Heart Association guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further studies in women, older individuals, and patients with prior CVD, and across different chronotypes and dietary schedules are warranted.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 13:27:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxOdGdZSXdwN0hOTnpPUHBVRFozNTVzbHMwaTRpZDQtZEN6c0xVX1dkMzlOeHhhejNpbjRBTXZMRHlZeHVPeUlzSW56a0VRbml0WWFrZElERjBTNWh1VTI0cXdlSW1qWUJscDJYdi1TdkFrazdNU2J4YVpFTUp1VXlyODBB</guid></item><item><title>揭开RFK Jr.关于疫苗的“双峰” --《华盛顿邮报》 | Unpacking RFK Jr.’s ‘doublespeak’ on vaccines - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxOX0Q1bi1OcG1TNzJtakdvcXNhODhBSENfV24zTmEzYktwTjNIVFhTRHcweDNHdngwZlFHYjljN1NZekZLLVhMMzVDT1ZsamtmZHRVRGZNUDBDQzRzcXpQXzdueWpFRnYyblBrN25JSkVQU1ItUnUwM0FMZVBWY3piRTNSdTBtMzA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="P815M6WYXH3BZ33GZQMH9B5HXC" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Early last month, after two Texas children had died &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak"&gt;of measles&lt;/a&gt;, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Experts worry the United States this year will record the largest number of cases since measles was declared eliminated a quarter-century ago. A recent study showed that if U.S. vaccination rates continue to decline, the nation could &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/24/measles-cases-deaths-vaccine-rates-rfk-jr/"&gt;face millions&lt;/a&gt; of cases over the next 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VDYEPAQZJJGCDI6ODHC56RMTJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Once an outbreak begins, health officials have only a short time to convince the U.S. public that vaccination is the proven way to save lives, said Chrissie Juliano, executive director of the Big Cities Health Coalition.

Shortly thereafter, Kennedy wrote in an &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414"&gt;X post&lt;/a&gt; that “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YSEHXBJ65NAAROTKVOXIKR3KGM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Hours later in a separate X post, he went on to praise the work of two local doctors who have criticized measles vaccination, and their treatment of measles patients with unproven therapies — budesonide and clarithromycin. Neither has &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-budesonide-and-clarithromycin-unproven-and-risky/?srsltid=AfmBOop53YvHFGlaqvrj5SAVXnYgtlaVL2r9AKtEJxaAEnJyWBmT813X"&gt;been proved effective&lt;/a&gt; as measles treatments and both could have serious side effects, medical experts have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HLMMGFWGZREHVIUZ276JKKSVJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The media “don’t notice how he de-emphasizes [vaccination] by just burying it in with a bunch of the other stuff about vitamin A, steroids, better diet, etc.,” said David Gorski, managing editor of Science-Based Medicine, a website run primarily by physicians that debunks medical misinformation. “It’s like they’ve learned nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TSMSAQVLRNHIXOK2FGKROR3X7M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Between those two statements, Kennedy drew headlines that portrayed him as a supporter of vaccines, including “Kennedy announces support for measles vaccine amid outbreak” in &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/06/kennedy-support-measles-vaccine-outbreak-00276021"&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt; and “RFK Jr. makes new push for vaccine after 2nd child dies of measles” on &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/video/rfk-jr-vaccine-is-most-effective-way-to-prevent-measles-spread-236693061564"&gt;Today.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HATBXVY8111NK1C3DZMD55JEW0" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/10/rfk-jr-personal-responsibility-health-care-donuts-smoking/"&gt;CBS News interview&lt;/a&gt; released a few days later, Kennedy received similar coverage. An initial clip highlighted Kennedy saying he “&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-measles-vaccine/"&gt;encourages&lt;/a&gt;” vaccination — but &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-measles-vaccine/"&gt;left out the context&lt;/a&gt; of his saying he was unsure whether the second child’s death was due to measles. Kennedy also falsely stated again that vaccines are not properly safety-tested, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/11/rfk-jr-vaccine-testing-concerns/?itid=ap_laurenweber_5"&gt;a claim he has made repeatedly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZIMALSZAPRESPJAG4OELH4FCYA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the interview with McGraw, better known as Dr. Phil, Kennedy claimed that one of his top three priorities is “making sure the vaccines are safe.” He said, erroneously, that the mumps portion and the combination MMR vaccine were never safety-tested. Medical experts said the MMR vaccine has been monitored for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6QEP6HISXFFTXPWK4PWZIAQIHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In response to questions about these claims, HHS said Kennedy would &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/30/rfk-jr-vaccine-testing/"&gt;institute placebo testing&lt;/a&gt; for all “new vaccines,” but it did not fully clarify what that would mean.

More than a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2275444"&gt;dozen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa021134"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; in peer-reviewed top journals in recent decades have rejected this link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X38NGWRVTX5P95RHQ6BRZZ6ZB4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When Kennedy talks, he “mixes a blend of fact and fiction, and since he is the highest health official in the country, that’s dangerous,” said Tom Frieden, CDC director under President Barack Obama and president and chief executive of the nonprofit Resolve to Save Lives. “Health advice is best provided by doctors who are deeply experienced with the facts about vaccines, and anything that undermines trust in measles and other vaccines undermines the health and safety of our kids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TUWUSPZNEZHGZHICHVJVCGML2I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When it comes to news about measles, Kennedy allies have released information to develop a narrative around the illness before others can debunk it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QG43PPTXGZAWZACGM674PHOTHY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;On April 5, controversial scientist Robert Malone &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/16/texas-measles-misinformation-vaccines/"&gt;was the first&lt;/a&gt; to write that “Another Texas Child Dies a Tragic Death After Recovering from Measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NL3JMDE33VHWVLB2SO74QZUP6A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;According to Malone, medical mismanagement was to blame. In a Substack post to his hundreds of thousands of followers, Malone said he wrote after hearing from a physician he said had knowledge of the child’s care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6BSZ5EDA4FHIRFJBPJPZ7Y6RMY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The press was amplifying the measles outbreak for the “political purposes” of smearing Kennedy, Malone told The Post. Malone previously sued The Post, alleging defamation over the newspaper’s reporting on his advocacy against the coronavirus vaccine. The case was dismissed in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J5G23AEH2BGYLLAFT7MAP5Y7DQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A day after Malone’s Substack account, the Texas Department of State Health Services reported the “&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak"&gt;second measles death&lt;/a&gt;” in a “school-aged child who tested positive for measles.” The child died of what “doctors described as measles pulmonary failure.

He took note that the phrase came in the third paragraph of a long post. And he said the post on X was edited to add language suggesting the measles outbreak was “flattening,” which independent fact-checkers and experts have said is misleading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LV75IZ5C4JEYFNMG2NMQ5GFMCI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Spencer interpreted the message and its revision as an attempt to speak to &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/robert-f-kennedy-measles-vaccine-rhetoric-19552867102b19e6df3ff14ed5030263"&gt;two audiences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CADUOG56YFA65NKRQ4BCJ2GISA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If you look at all the replies, it was a mix of basically, ‘Look, he says vaccines are really important’ and ‘Oh, my God, I can’t believe you are betraying us,’” Spencer said. “It was fascinating to see how people saw this moment different.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6DIZEXCA2VDSFDDOWVK5QJ6Z4Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Children’s Health Defense, Kennedy’s former organization, also has published information about the ongoing measles outbreak.

Oklahoma, Missouri, Colorado, Louisiana and Arkansas made up the rest of the top 10, per the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawaii, however, was the state deemed to have the best handle on its drug problem, followed by Utah, Nebraska, Connecticut, and Florida. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-461c9u-0 hisihR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Mexico topped the list in individual metrics, ranking first for teenage drug users, third for drug users and seventh in the overdose tally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are major substance abuse concerns amongst teenagers in the state, according to the analysis. New Mexico has been found to have the highest proportion of teens using illicit &lt;a href="/topic/drugs"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt; and the highest share of young people reporting they had tried marijuana before the age of 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Virginia, the state deemed to have the second-worst substance abuse problem, has the most drug overdose fatalities in the U.S. The number of deaths in West Virginia is more than nine times greater than in Nebraska, which has the fewest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-uwxkcg-0 sc-uwxkcg-1 dIYBnZ ipsoSp"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-uwxkcg-4 loMtYN number-length-10"&gt;81 deaths &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-uwxkcg-5 kxWqlF"&gt;&lt;p&gt;from drug overdoses in West Virginia, per 100,000 people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those battling drug addiction in the states ranked worst may find it difficult to get the help they need, with a few substance abuse treatment centers and professionals working in mental health for the size of the population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 hOqAvf"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/03/18/23/Opioid_Companies_Lawsuit_31713.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/03/18/23/Opioid_Companies_Lawsuit_31713.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/03/18/23/Opioid_Companies_Lawsuit_31713.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Signs are displayed at a tent during a health event, June 26, 2021, in Charleston, West Virginia, offering Naloxone, a drug that reverses the effects of an opioid overdose" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-158432"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;Signs are displayed at a tent during a health event, June 26, 2021, in Charleston, West Virginia, offering Naloxone, a drug that reverses the effects of an opioid overdose&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Copyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents in Nevada, ranked third worst on the list, have the poorest access to substance abuse treatment facilities and counselors per capita, the analysis found. The gambling capital was the single worst state for drug health issues and rehabilitation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jennifer Murphy, an associate professor and chair of criminal justice at Pennsylvania State University, says that enhanced access to treatment, not punishment, is key to combating America’s drug crisis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to enact more policies that give individuals the opportunity to engage in harm reduction and treatment services,” she said. “We need to make these services low-barrier and easy to access so people can get the help that they need.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And sometimes it’s a far wider issue. Gene Heyman, a senior lecturer at Boston College’s Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, says that “the most powerful correlate of drug overdose deaths” is “intergenerational income mobility,” meaning the extent to which an individual is able to have a better life and income than their parents. In places where adult children earn less than their parents, areas that have lost industries such as the Midwest ‘rust belt’ and West Virginia and Kentucky coal mining counties, drug overdoses are higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 12:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPYV9HTHg1bW1PR0dOTi1YYTlFLTU5eC02M1dzLUhnTFZtS05qVlIxSU1qbkpsSFl3YUdJSExlWWgtSnB1RUhnUE5SdExLcFBUamhLR1VjOXlnS0h0aXExVWxxWXZELWNWZnkzQ3VEWUNPWDFUQkhDRm4zbmluUDkyTmF3RHB0X3JROEhKR1Zrb0g4alpEX0drbDlLbEs5amdO</guid></item><item><title>特朗普正在发动一场新的战争。这可能会让您的家人处于危险之中。- HuffPost | Trump Is Waging A New Kind Of War.

As his oncologist, I looked at him with empathy, even though I was not confident he would live to see that day. At the time, his disease was considered incurable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a new study had just been published suggesting that patients like Eric might be cured through aggressive surgery and chemotherapy. I presented his case at my hospital’s cancer conference. Most of my colleagues dismissed the idea, but one surgeon agreed to try. Together, we offered Eric a path forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty years later, Eric remains cancer-free. He has two grown daughters and a son. No aisle to walk down yet, but he’s still here and ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric’s situation is no longer an exception. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7439273/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Meticulous research" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681a6fd2e4b035302f2497e9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7439273/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;Meticulous research&lt;/a&gt; over the years has proven what was once thought impossible: We can cure approximately 25% of patients with stage IV colon cancer that has metastasized to the liver.

              &lt;p&gt;Moderna’s mRNA-based flu and covid-19 vaccine could provide the best of both worlds—if it’s actually ever approved by the Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This week, scientists at Moderna &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2833668"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; data from a Phase III trial testing the company’s combination vaccine, codenamed mRNA-1083. Individuals given mRNA-1083 appeared to generate the same or even greater immune response compared to those given separate vaccines, the researchers found. But the FDA’s recent policy change on vaccine approvals, orchestrated by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, could imperil the development of this and other future vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trial involved 8,000 people split into two age groups: those between the ages of 50 and 64, and those over 65. People were randomly given mRNA-1083 (plus a placebo) or two already approved flu and covid-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The vaccine seemed effective across both age groups, with mRNA-1083 participants showing at least the same level of humoral immune response (antibody-based) to circulating flu and covid-19 strains as participants who were given the separate vaccines. On average, this response was actually higher to the flu strains in particular among those given mRNA-1083. The experimental vaccine also appeared to be safe and well-tolerated, as the authors &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2833668"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; in their paper, published Wednesday in JAMA.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The study results are certainly encouraging, and typically they would pave the way toward a surefire FDA approval. But the political situation has changed for the worse. The Department of Health and Human Services &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/rfk-jr-calls-new-vaccines-undergo-placebo-controlled/story?id=121412127"&gt;recently mandated&lt;/a&gt; an overhaul of the vaccine approval process, one that will require all new vaccines to undergo placebo-controlled trials to receive approval.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While many experimental vaccines today are placebo-tested (including the original covid-19 vaccines), it’s unclear whether this order will also apply to vaccines that can be compared to existing vaccines, like the combination mRNA-1083 vaccine, or to vaccines that have to be regularly updated to match fast-evolving viruses like the flu and covid-19.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some vaccine experts have said that these changes &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/01/nx-s1-5383172/rfk-jr-placebo-vaccine-testing-studies#:~:text=Offit%2C%20Hotez%20and,an%20ethical%20trial.%22"&gt;are unnecessary and potentially unethical&lt;/a&gt;, since it could leave some people vulnerable to an infection that already has a vaccine. The new rule also might delay the availability of upcoming seasonal vaccines, particularly the &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/01/health/hhs-universal-flu-coronavirus-vaccine-initiative"&gt;current covid-19 shots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A potentially important wrinkle for the mRNA-1083 vaccine is that no mRNA-based vaccine for the flu is currently approved. That reality could very well be all that the FDA needs to demand further placebo-controlled trials. RFK Jr. and other recent Trump appointees have also been highly skeptical of mRNA-based vaccines in general, despite no strong evidence that these vaccines are significantly less safe than other types. Kennedy, who has a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-made-a-million-dollars-from-his-anti-vax-work-that-he-previously-claimed-was-unpaid-2000550692"&gt;long history of supporting&lt;/a&gt; the anti-vaccination movement, has even &lt;a href="https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2021/robert-f-kennedy-jr-said-the-covid-19-vaccine-is-the-deadliest-vaccine-ever-made-thats-not-true/"&gt;wrongly declared&lt;/a&gt; that the mRNA covid-19 vaccine was the “deadliest vaccine ever made.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moderna &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/moderna-beats-wall-street-estimates-first-quarter-profit-sales-2025-05-01/#:~:text=Moderna%20said%20on%20Thursday%20it%20now%20does%20not%20expect%20regulatory%20approval%20for%20its%20combination%20flu/COVID%2D19%20shot%20until%202026%2C%20after%20the%20FDA%20said%20it%20required%20late%2Dstage%20data%20demonstrating%20the%20shot%27s%20efficacy%20against%20the%20flu."&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt; last week it doesn’t expect its mRNA-1083 vaccine to be approved before 2026, following the FDA’s request for late-stage data showing the vaccine’s effectiveness against flu specifically. But it’s worth wondering if even that timeline is now in jeopardy under the current public health regime.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Soaking them in hot water seems to help but only temporarily. What can I do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Ellie replies: &lt;/span&gt;Burning foot syndrome is a recognised condition where people experience pain and heaviness in their feet, particularly at night time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms tend to be related to the nerves – the fibres that send electrical signals from the body to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The nerves are responsible for how we experience sensations such as heat and pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Burning feet can sometimes be caused by a vitamin B deficiency – a crucial nutrient found in foods including meat and fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is also linked to chronic &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-26679480-2e4c-11f0-905f-5da497a40a06"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; problems, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-26699050-2e4c-11f0-905f-5da497a40a06"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and thyroid disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A GP can carry out blood tests to identify if one of these could be the cause. Treating those conditions may help combat the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Burning feet can sometimes be caused by a vitamin B deficiency – a crucial nutrient found in foods including meat and fish&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Soaking the feet in cold – rather than hot – water does provide patients with some relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, patients with no clear cause of their burning foot syndrome can also be given medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This includes amitriptyline, gabapentin and pregabalin, which block abnormal nerve signals. This should reduce the pain and improve sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;I'm 74 and have discoid eczema. It seems to get worse in hot weather. The creams don’t seem to make a difference. Could my statins and blood pressure tablets be to blame?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Ellie replies:&lt;/span&gt; Discoid eczema is an itchy skin condition which triggers circular red patches. Sometimes, new prescription drugs can trigger it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-42c16c50-2e4c-11f0-905f-5da497a40a06" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14700051/My-feet-feel-like-theyre-burning-stop-DR-ELLIE-reveals-secret-treating-excruciating-syndrome.html"&gt; &lt;font&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;WRITE TO DR ELLIE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Do you have a question for Dr Ellie Cannon? Email DrEllie@mailonsunday.couk&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can occur anywhere on the body, excluding the face. The patches tend to be dry and crusty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As we age, the skin barrier becomes less effective, which means that it can get dehydrated and irritated. This is how discoid eczema occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The key to tackling discoid eczema is rehydrating the skin. One way to do this is using an emollient – which is another word for moisturiser. Some common emollients you can buy from most chemists include E45, Diprobase and Cetraben.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients need to use these regularly – a minimum of twice a day. They should also use the creams in large amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For a discoid eczema patient, a large 500g tub of emollient shouldn’t last longer than a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most pharmacists will stock multiple ones and should be able to help patients pick the one that is right for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alongside emollients, a GP can prescribe steroid creams for the patches to reduce the inflammation. But these will only work if the skin is well hydrated with an emollient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s also important to identify triggers that make the eczema worse. Lathery soaps, bubble baths and certain types of washing detergents can cause this issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heat is also a known skin irritant, so it’s important to keep rooms in the house cooler. Some patients also find that using a humidifier will stop the skin drying out when the heating is on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If a skin condition started at the same time as a medication, this could also be a trigger. It might be worth discussing switching to an alternative medicine with a GP to see if the symptoms improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, never stop taking prescription drugs without telling your family doctor first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;I am due to have a trapeziectomy on my right thumb, but I’m worried that I could suffer nerve damage. Is this procedure safe?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Ellie replies&lt;/span&gt;: Nerve damage is always a possibility after an operation, but the chances of it occurring are low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The trapezium is a little bone on the wrist right at the bottom of the thumb. It is a common site for osteoarthritis – the painful joint problems caused by long-term wear and tear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not only does osteoarthritis in the trapezium impair movement of the thumb, it often leads to constant pain because of how often we use our thumbs. A trapeziectomy is a procedure which involves completely removing the small bone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the majority of people this is both safe and effective at reducing pain (patients also retain the majority of movement in the thumb even without the bone).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research suggests that around 15 per cent of people who have a trapeziectomy develop some form of nerve damage in the skin around the thumb, which can lead to numbness or tingling. A third of patients also have continued pain or weakness after the operation. For these reasons, surgical procedures like this would only be offered to the most severely affected arthritis patients. Given the intense pain this condition can cause, most people opt for surgery and take the small risk of side-effects. But that is a decision entirely for the patient – and no one else – to decide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;GPs must not ignore underweight adults &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I strongly agree with the growing calls for GPs to pay more attention to older patients who are underweight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last month, former health secretary Dame Patricia Hewitt, 76, revealed she nearly died while on holiday after suffering dehydration. She was in hospital for six weeks. Doctors said her low body weight – 7st 11lb – was in part responsible for her severe symptoms and slow recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When patients are underweight, their body lacks energy reserves which can be crucial when patients fall ill, particularly if they eat less, further weakening them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet GPs too often focus on tackling obesity and forget to identify underweight older adults, who could be referred to a diet specialist for treatment. We need to do more to help these patients. Have you fallen sick due to being underweight? Write and let me know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Will a second NHS app help? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I'm sceptical of the Government’s latest plan to improve NHS cancer care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this month, a new app, called Cancer 360, was announced. It is meant to bring cancer patients’ medical data into one place. The Government says it will ‘cut waits and save lives’. But I am confused by this plan (not to mention the bold claims about the good it will do for patients).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s true cancer patients often struggle to easily access their records. This is because many are seen by various doctors in separate departments – sometimes in different hospitals. But why isn’t this information being brought together within the NHS App?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Why on Earth are we adding another app to the mix? It’s likely Cancer 360 will face the same problems as the NHS one. Hospitals will not be required to take part in the app, meaning many patients will fail to see a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 11:07:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4wFBVV95cUxNN29MTFNURmRCd3hLcXFmYWk1TW9hWHB4M0ZEcGRNd0lkWExLbmU0d2pGRTJ3dEppYkM3TTRmcVZ5MUFlTWhBdmRsakYtTVN4YkpldWljVXY5ZC1rWWo4eV9lakhzR2xvRnl2b3BCa1NHNnRObW4xeWVYank0N2QxTXFFUk1KTVZ6ZHFrNG5fTHJaMDJPeGU4eXN0SWNpdVRGNTFfakZrV1l3V0tQeEhfMFF1TG15Ynh0QkpQeUlNYW5HaVFKX1pzRDZPM3EwRFppVDhFT0VRUjhQS291bzBUXy0wbw</guid></item><item><title>每个人都突然担心蛋白质。有一个团体是理所当然的--《旧金山纪事报》 | Everyone is suddenly worried about protein.

Specifically, Kim said there is an “association between ... excessive alcohol use and heart disease and stroke risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol recommendations vary by person, but, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/alcohol-use.htm" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="the CDC" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681cf820e4b02fbba8e793ba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/alcohol-use.htm" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;the CDC&lt;/a&gt; considers more than four drinks in one sitting for women or five drinks in one sitting for men to be excessive drinking. More than eight drinks per week for women and 15 drinks per week for men is also considered excessive drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, it’s accepted that women should not have more than one alcoholic drink a day and men should not have more than two, Kim said. These are also the recommendations put forth by the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/moderate-drinking.htm" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dietary Guidelines for Americans" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681cf820e4b02fbba8e793ba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/moderate-drinking.htm" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="13"&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignore Your Diet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A proper diet is important for managing stroke risk, too. This means moderating foods that are full of saturated fats, sugar and salt, Wang said. (Additionally, Kim pointed out that there is a relationship between salt intake and high blood pressure, which, as we now know, is another stroke risk factor.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to what you &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;eat, Kim points to the work of author and journalist &lt;a href="https://michaelpollan.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Michael Pollan" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681cf820e4b02fbba8e793ba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://michaelpollan.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;Michael Pollan&lt;/a&gt;. This advice is “eat food, mostly plants, not too much,” Wang said. This means having a diet that’s rich in fruits and veggies with some meat added in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dismiss Necessary Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since strokes are so common in this country (and this world), it’s important that you’re aware of the signs and get treated as soon as possible. Available stroke treatments work better the sooner they’re done, Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because many strokes aren’t painful, and the symptoms of stroke vary so much, it’s important to recognize symptoms of stroke,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, there’s a useful acronym to help people remember the signs — and that &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org/en/help-and-support/resource-library/fast-materials" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="acronym is FAST" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681cf820e4b02fbba8e793ba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.stroke.org/en/help-and-support/resource-library/fast-materials" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="15"&gt;acronym is FAST&lt;/a&gt;, Kim said.

Science is figuring out ways to pump those numbers up again and pointing the way toward living more years — and more &lt;em&gt;healthy &lt;/em&gt;years. And this doesn’t require sci-fi, Silicon Valley anti-aging technology like &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/2023/07/13/blueprint-ceo-bryan-johnson-defends-plasma-donation-son-youth-aging-longevity-brainstorm-tech-fortune-utah/"&gt;blood swapping&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1471491416300533#:~:text=Cellular%20reprogramming%20has%20demonstrated%20that,to%20extend%20a%20healthy%20lifespan."&gt;cellular reprogramming&lt;/a&gt;. According to Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and the author of the new book &lt;a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Super-Agers/Eric-Topol/9781668067666"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Agers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there are evidence-based steps you can take right now to help ensure you live a longer, healthier life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“We’re at a turning point,” Topol told me in an interview this week. “Thanks to advances in the science of aging, we can actually show everything is going in the right direction. We’re making headway.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="know-and-lower-your-biological-age" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Know — and lower — your biological age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It used to be that if you wanted to know how old you are, all you needed was a calendar. But your body’s aging isn’t as simple as turning the pages on a calendar: Depending on who you are and how you live, different parts of your body can age more quickly or slowly than. And it turns out this other kind of aging, biological aging, matters more for your health than the number of candles on your birthday cake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Super Agers&lt;/em&gt;, Topol points to a “metric revolution” in which blood-based proteomic clocks and DNA-methylation scores can pinpoint which organ system is aging the fastest, and by how many years. A 2024 &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine &lt;/em&gt;study used machine learning to &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/gauging-biological-age-disease-risk-proteomic-clock"&gt;examine&lt;/a&gt; more than 200 plasma proteins in thousands of people and showed that the resulting biological age forecasted 18 major diseases and all-cause mortality better than any single risk factor, like blood pressure or body mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“When you particularize risk to a person, the chance of them taking actions to mitigate it is much, much higher,” Topol said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s one thing to know generally that as you get older, you need to be aware of the risks of heart disease or neurodegenerative diseases. It’s another thing to be told that your brain age is, say, five years ahead of your calendar age — which means you need to intervene now to protect yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you can do: &lt;/strong&gt;Companies are &lt;a href="https://tallyhealth.com/products/test-kit"&gt;already offering&lt;/a&gt; biological age tests that &lt;a href="https://outliyr.com/best-epigenetic-age-tests-review"&gt;you can order&lt;/a&gt; for your own use. Down the line, scientists at the University of Washington are &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news-releases/new-health-assessment-tool-gauges-bodys-biological-age"&gt;developing&lt;/a&gt; a multi-organ biological clock that will be developed into a digital app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="eat-like-the-mediterraneans-do" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Eat like the Mediterraneans do&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s no field where the prevailing advice seems more conflicting and confusing than in the science of nutrition. Atkins, South Beach, Paleo, Zone — you’d be forgiven for throwing up your hands and just ordering takeout from DoorDash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But we do know what you eat is key to how well and how long you’ll live, and the current American diet, heavy on ultra-processed foods and red meat, isn’t cutting it. “Our diet is basically inviting disease instead of preventing it., Topol said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A 30-year study &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/midlife-eating-patterns-tied-health-decades-later"&gt;looked at&lt;/a&gt; 105,000 adults and found that of the one in 10 study subjects who reached age 70 without cancer, cardiac disease, or serious cognitive decline, virtually all scored high on an eating index that closely tracks Mediterranean-style diets. That means plenty of whole grains, vegetables, olive oil, and omega-rich seafood. You should also try to cut out sugars and ultraprocessed foods as much as possible, and go very easy on red meat, which Topol notes can trigger &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959437X24001552?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;aging-accelerating inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you can do: &lt;/strong&gt;Start by something as simple as swapping out butter for olive oil and soda for sparkling water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="sleep-more-and-sleep-deeper" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Sleep more — and sleep deeper&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;At this point, I think everyone knows &lt;a href="/science-and-health/2018/4/16/17233860/night-owl-chronobiology-sleeping-late-health-risk"&gt;just how important&lt;/a&gt; it is to get a good night’s sleep. Poor sleep is &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/health-risks-of-poor-sleep"&gt;associated&lt;/a&gt; with everything from heart disease to diabetes to dementia to obesity to cancer, not to mention a significantly increased risk of watching way too many Netflix shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But as Topol told me, it’s not just how much sleep you’re getting, but &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you’re sleeping. “The key thing is deep sleep,” he said. “If you don’t get it, you’re much more subject to brain aging and the three major diseases of aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Research &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40110600/"&gt;has shown&lt;/a&gt; that people who get fewer hours of deep sleep per night have a greater risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases like dementia, while a larger amount of deep sleep &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2023/05/03/deep-sleep-may-mitigate-alzheimers-memory-loss-berkeley-research-shows/"&gt;can act as a protection&lt;/a&gt; against Alzheimer’s-related memory loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you can do: &lt;/strong&gt;During the writing of &lt;em&gt;Super Agers&lt;/em&gt;, Topol increased his own deep sleep from around 15 minutes per night to over an hour by adhering to a consistent sleep schedule and tracking his progress with wearables. And steer clear of drugs and supplements, which are unlikely to help you get the deep, restorative slumber you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As a cardiologist, Topol was long focused on aerobic exercise, which helps build up the cardiovascular system. But he now realizes that’s not enough. “Aerobic was the thing,” he told me. “Now we know that strength and core training are equally important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One meta-analysis from 2022 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35599175/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that just an hour of resistance training per week lowered all-cause mortality by as much as 25 percent. And beyond trying to reduce the chance of death, strength training when you’re younger helps build up muscle mass, slowing down the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2804956/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20striking,60%20%5B4%2C5%5D."&gt;inevitable decline of muscle that occurs as you age&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you can do: &lt;/strong&gt;You don’t have to start &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076578/"&gt;pumping iron&lt;/a&gt; like 1970s Arnold Schwarzenegger to get the anti-aging benefits of strength training. Bodyweight exercises will go a long way, as will resistance training that involves exercise bands. And as much as you may hate them, &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/those-squat-pulses-burn-fire-171649684.html"&gt;don’t neglect those squats!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It may seem inevitable that as you age, your social circle and connections shrink. But it doesn’t have to be that way — and there are enormous longevity benefits to keeping connected to the world and the people around you. “The strong data for social isolation shows it will compromise healthy aging,” Topol said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A 2023 meta-analysis &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37337095/"&gt;linked social isolation&lt;/a&gt; to a 32 percent higher risk of all-cause mortality, while self-reported loneliness specifically tacked on another 14 percent. Neuro-imaging studies &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9702717/"&gt;have even shown&lt;/a&gt; a biological effect from being alone, demonstrating spikes in inflammatory cytokines and the shrinkage of hippocampal volume in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you can do: &lt;/strong&gt;Get off your couch and out of your house, for one thing! Schedule regular face time with a friend, and ideally do it outside: Frequent time in nature &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-82747-3"&gt;has been associated&lt;/a&gt; with reduced epigenetic aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s plenty more in &lt;em&gt;Super Agers&lt;/em&gt;, including Topol’s optimism around GLP-1 inhibitors like Ozempic, which have been showing the ability to reduce the &lt;a href="https://aaic.alz.org/releases-2024/glp-drug-liraglutide-may-protect-against-dementia.asp#:~:text=Cognitive%20function%20was%20calculated%20as,Edison%20said."&gt;risk of diseases of aging like dementia&lt;/a&gt;.

I'm pretty in tune with my body. This was not normal for me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Upon mentioning to her GP, Gemma's symptoms were overlooked and simply put down to a recent bout of sickness, with nothing alarming to note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, over the following two months, her bleeding got worse and that's when Gemma knew she had to press for further answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I went to a different GP, and I'm very grateful that she took it more seriously and said "okay, let's just get an ultrasound to rule out anything possible",' she recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Personal trainer Gemma Henly (pictured) was the picture of health, before her shock ovarian cancer diagnosis at 30&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After noticing a change in her menstrual cycles, Gemma sought answers from two separate GP's for her worrying symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Unfortunately, or fortunately I guess, we found it (the cancer) and that started a cascade of more tests.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In February 2025, Gemma's blood tests and pelvic ultrasound revealed she had abnormal growths on both of her ovaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was surreal, but I think you just go into shock,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My gynaecologist had emailed to say to bring a support person to my appointment. So, I think instantly you know it's not going to be good news.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With no family history of cancer, a clean bill of health and already being up to date with her cervical screening tests, it was the last thing Gemma thought she'd hear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctors knew time was precious, and although immediate surgery was crucial, there was another factor they had to consider - and that was children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was referred to a gynaecological oncologist who was the surgeon, to explore all avenues as to whether there was any chance we could preserve my fertility,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There was hope that we could potentially preserve my uterus so even if I couldn't use my own eggs, I could potentially look at like a donor egg option in in the future.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After being diagnosed with Stage 1C ovarian and Stage 1A uterus cancer, Gemma underwent a total hysterectomy in March 2025, followed by chemotherapy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Although she still has a long road ahead of her, Gemma is still focused on her fitness and trying to still move her body every day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sadly for Gemma, further tests, biopsies and keyhole surgery revealed the cancer had spread to her uterus too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gemma's ovarian cancer was found at Stage 1C and the cancer in her uterus was Stage 1A, which is early, but still very serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the beginning of March 2025, surgeons performed a total hysterectomy, removing her uterus including both of her ovaries and fallopian tubes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think it's something that I probably won't process properly for a little while.

From improving the cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure, body weight, and body mass index (BMI), to lowering blood sugar, boosting immune function, and improving mood, walking offers several physical and mental health benefits.Dr. Manan Vora, an orthopedic surgeon and sport and exercise medicine specialist based in Mumbai, has now shared the powerful health benefits of walking that accumulate with every step. The health expert, who has over 450K Instagram followers on Instagram, recently shared a minute-by-minute breakdown of how walking transforms the body, from just 60 seconds to a full hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every minute you walk… your body thanks you,” the orthopedic surgeon said in a video shared on Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just one minute of walking jumpstarts blood flow, Dr. Vora explained. This small burst of movement enhances circulation, delivering oxygen and nutrients to muscles and organs. By five minutes, the benefits surge, with individuals often experiencing an uplifted mood as endorphins begin to flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reaching the 10-minute mark, the body starts to reduce cortisol, the hormone associated with stress. This will start to melt away tension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking for 15 minutes can help regulate glucose levels, and will help manage diabetes by preventing blood glucuose spikes after meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Kate Cassidy Hits Pause After Inheritance Liam Payne Snub: 'Hard For Me To Get Out Of Bed...'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;At &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/fitness/20-benefits-of-walking-for-30-minutes-every-day/articleshow/120368296.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;30 minutes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, walking shifts the body into fat-burning mode. “Your body starts tapping into fat stores,” Dr. Vora said. This duration is a sweet spot for those aiming to improve body composition. Those who are on a weight loss journey can also aim to get 30 minutes of brisk walking in their fitness routine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2017 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316622105833#ab0005" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; looked into how moderate walking enhances the effects of an energy-restricted diet on fat mass loss. "Participation in a 12-week weight-loss study resulted in significant reductions in body weight and fat mass and was associated with significant improvements in biomarkers for cardiovascular disease risk. Moderate walking enhanced the effects of a hypoenergetic diet (DI) on fat loss and serum insulin,” the authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits continue to build over time. By 45 minutes, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/walk" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;walk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;ing reduces overthinking. A long walk can quiet the mind and help you break free from repetitive thoughts. For those who reach 60 minutes, the rewards are even greater. Dr. Vora pointed out that an hour of walking boosts dopamine, the brain’s feel-good neurotransmitter. “Your brain rewards you with dopamine,” he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who knew a simple walk could be your best therapy!

When people get to a certain age, many try various anti-ageing treatments, including Botox and pricey creams, to try and turn back the march of time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, he swears by a certain ingredient found in bright fruits and veg, which he eats frequently and claims can help plump up collagen, lift mood, and keep illnesses at bay.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On his &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/bbc"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; Radio 4 show 'Stay Young', Dr Michael Mosley, the mastermind behind the 5:2 and Fast 800 diets, who sadly died last year said: "Now I'm 66 years old and I've tried all sorts of ways to look younger including Botox, micro-needling, creams. I once even had my face burnt with a device which looked like a red hot iron.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"All in the name of science obviously and none of these approaches were impressive enough to make me want to go back for more. At my age and after a lifetime of regularly getting sunburnt you might expect me to look really wrinkly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "But I'm not. It could be because of my skin type or it could be because of something I've just pulled out of the oven. It's something I eat a lot of and which it's claimed can reduce wrinkles, thicken collagen, boost mood and protect me from a host of illnesses.", reports &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/health/dr-michael-mosley-reveals-anti-8595033" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;Bristol Live&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As Dr Mosley removed his culinary creation from the oven, he said, "This is a tray of bright-coloured vegetables, freshly roasted and delicious. I know it sounds unlikely but there is some pretty convincing science behind the skin benefits of fruit and veg, especially the brightly coloured ones."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He continued to elaborate on the benefits of such vibrantly hued produce: "That's what I have here - they include tomatoes, red peppers, butternut squash and sweet potatoes, plus, of course, carrots."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Dr Mosley, these particular veggies are rich in carotenoids which not only give carrots, mangoes, and tomatoes their eye-catching hues but also significantly enhance your skin's collagen and hydration levels. This, in turn, can lead to fewer wrinkles and greater skin plumpness and texture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Mosley further commented, "Research has shown that your collagen levels and wrinkles can be greatly improved with diet. Several large-scale studies have found that those who eat more vegetables have far fewer wrinkles and plumper skin. One study found that eating lots of colourful veg - around 250 grams a day - was key to looking young."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He concluded by explaining why this might be the case: "Why? Well, plants contain an impressive array of anti-ageing compounds and when it comes to your skin one of the most important are the carotenoids. As the name suggests you can find them in carrots, but they're also in many other yellow, orange and red fruits and vegetables such as tomatoes, sweet potatoes, butternut squash, melons and mangoes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Carotenoids are chemical cousins of retinol, considered to be the anti-ageing compound when it comes to wrinkles. They're highly effective anti-oxidants which can protect your skin at the cellular level. In lab tests carotenoids have been shown to protect collagen-producing skin fibroblasts from damage caused by UV radiation and oxidative stress - both big drivers of skin ageing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Carotenoids can also skin cells into producing higher lauric acid, the ingredient in many anti-ageing creams and fillers which can help your skin retain moisture."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Mosley explained that this also enhances collagen production.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His views were echoed by Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London and co-founder of the health App Zoe. He said people should be eating foods ‘the colours of the rainbow’ for major health benefits including drastically improving gut health, reverse ageing and reducing inflammation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is inflammation&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Inflammation is something which is caused by an overactive immune system and can lead to chronic inflammation which in turn can cause many of the diseases which we associate with ageing such as joint pain, type 2 diabetes, and depression. Polyphenols are types of defence chemical in plants which gives them their bright colour and bitter taste. As well as protecting the plant, polyphenols feed your good gut bacteria and inhibit the growth of bad bacteria.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prof Spector explained: “Eating more plants is one of the best things you can do for your gut health, and one of the big reasons why is because of polyphenols. These are phytonutrients, the defence chemicals that you find in plants, and it’s important to realise that the same also in canned versions, whether it’s tomatoes or beans, they act as prebiotics for your gut microbes that use these chemicals as fuel, and they convert them into short chain fatty acids, which then go and act in an anti-inflammatory, immune boosting way for our bodies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 06:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxORlNXVTZRNFVudkp0S1dnbU5vM0dZQS1tX2tXSFlRM3Q3SWhKNGt0QkRKTm93aFB3ODJ6S0h2cUVzNGVYUEF5LS1HdzBMeXptcWF1d19PaWt1UUxSREd0QWgyUktva3pybzRacWRheF9mUk1KX0l6SnIzaUc2dkZjVm52aTdqdHFFU2fSAY8BQVVfeXFMTUg2b0RNTjFsM0xmRlEzTkY3LWozNmNzcy1QOFdnbVdPNnZQZm1xNUZPaDdDYTFyY1RGc05vNnozdlFrdzJtdHdBWW1hQWQ1WlFIQVRHTnQ0bWlmbUJOQTNtWU1jUWtONkd0TjdtLTVBR0xwSUlVV1d3UnktNnVyZzN5U0RjR3lTbndvblhzbE0</guid></item><item><title>隐孢子虫：男孩， 4岁，参观牛桥农场后住院- BBC | Cryptosporidium: Boy, 4, hospitalised after visit to farm in Cowbridge - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9uTmI5Rk5OU1ExdUlsWl9oZTZ5YmpzbEc4SVhsbzE4Z1loaG5SRU83U2pLRjA0dElCRTQwQWQyRmdwVW91SVcwZTlmU0tScGxOVnZVTDZVTUNDZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE5MbXRmQi1laFlYMl9WYUFtVFdVc2dNTnVULTQ3RnpoY1Z3RGtiXzVvYmJUVmkzVkNFQlhMNXUzbE5ERGt5UDltaHZIQ25DUjJiVlQyOWg0eS1ocnpNYWJj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-737179d2-0 dAzQyd"&gt;Four-year-old boy hospitalised as 74 ill after petting farm trip&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250428-123652-7bc49a8f4-web-2.20.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d29f/live/5728b190-2dc4-11f0-b5aa-31829502a3f1.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d29f/live/5728b190-2dc4-11f0-b5aa-31829502a3f1.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d29f/live/5728b190-2dc4-11f0-b5aa-31829502a3f1.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d29f/live/5728b190-2dc4-11f0-b5aa-31829502a3f1.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d29f/live/5728b190-2dc4-11f0-b5aa-31829502a3f1.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d29f/live/5728b190-2dc4-11f0-b5aa-31829502a3f1.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d29f/live/5728b190-2dc4-11f0-b5aa-31829502a3f1.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d29f/live/5728b190-2dc4-11f0-b5aa-31829502a3f1.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Family photo A smiling woman with light blonde hair, wearing a grey cardigan and sat on a black fold-out chair with a young smiling blonde boy wearing a blue jumper on her lap.

Shortly after, in December 2024, he received an email telling him he had melanoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Captain Jason Chambers is known for being at the helm of luxury yachts on the reality TV show Below Deck Down Under&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Chambers underwent two procedures to remove the sun spot from his ribs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chambers was stunned, but was traveling to promote his Bravo reality show &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Below Deck Down Under&lt;/span&gt; so he scrambled to try and get a doctors appointment for when he returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he was discouraged by how challenging it was, telling DailyMail.com: 'It's such a long wait to get in to a dermatologist, which is a sad thing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eventually he was able to get an appointment with a doctor in Sydney - but the challenges didn't end there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While doctors in Bali removed the spot, Australian physicians weren't satisfied with some details in the report, which didn't include what stage melanoma Chambers had or what margins the skin cancer showed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While they estimated stage 2, which meant Chambers would have to undergo a more invasive procedure to remove muscle around the spot on his ribs, doctors told him if he could get the biopsy shipped to Australia, they could give him a more precise diagnosis and prognosis.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, this required weeks of logistical planning and red tape to cut through, which worried Chambers, and he began doing his own research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told this website: 'As that period went on, I started researching and [questioned] how was I so naïve? How did I not just see a dermatologist every year prior?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That process was just so upsetting.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Melanoma kills more than 8,300 Americans each year, according to the Melanoma Research Foundation (MRF), but about 90 percent of cases are considered to be preventable through vigilance about sun safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Melanoma Institute of Australia reports 95 percent of melanomas are caused by overexposure to UV radiation from the sun, but if caught early, 90 percent of cases can be cured by surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Melanoma is also the second most common cancer in Australian men and kills about 1,300 people overall per year in the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The superyacht captain said doctors told him there is only a  five percent chance his melanoma will return&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In an interview with DailyMail.com Chambers showed off his melanoma scar, which he described as being the size of a pinky finger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On Christmas Eve, Chambers finally had answers. Australian doctors said the team in Bali had gotten good margins. All they had to do was remove a little bit more near the original site but there was only a five percent chance of his melanoma returning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, he would be due for follow ups every few months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chambers said his scar is about the size of his pinky finger and his first follow up is in just a few weeks, and he has pledged to get checks annually going forward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After his diagnosis the yacht captain took to social media to talk about his ordeal, which he said led to a flurry of people sharing similar stories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moved by what he was hearing, Chambers was inspired and is now using his platform to raise awareness. He will even be the emcee for the Melanoma Research Foundation's annual &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://us.givergy.com/MRFNYGala25/?controller=home"&gt;gala&lt;/a&gt; in New York City in October. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'I think my social media - I haven't been trying to sell things - my social media is only used for a few pillars, which is education, sustainability and my health, and I work with a few foundations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When MRF reached out to me and asked if I would participate, it's within my pillars and it's very hard to find a foundation that's got so much substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They asked me to be a special guest. I don't know how special I am, but it's actually quite humbling. I'm getting little goose bumps now.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Chambers told DailyMail.com after he posted about his melanoma diagnosis on social media, people reached out to him to share similar stories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Above is a picture of the spot on Chambers' ribs that turned out to be melanoma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average lifetime risk of developing melanoma is about three percent - or one in 33 people - but the risk increases if a person has a family history of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chambers did not have a family history.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rates of new melanomas vary - in people younger than 50, they've been stable among women and have declined by about one percent per year in men since early the 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The five-year survival rate for melanoma is 94 percent, but that drops to 35 percent for melanomas that have spread and could be even lower depending on far the cancer has progressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, Chambers told this website he is following the Australian mantra of 'slip, slop, slap.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained: 'I'm staying out of the sun. Slip, slop, slap we call it in Australia - we slip on a hat, slop on some sunscreen and slap on a shirt.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And he is more aware now, he added, wishing he could go back and tell himself to cover up, wear sunscreen and limit his daily sun exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told DailyMail.com: 'Skin cancer is happening... it is going to happen to you if you are overexposed. So minimize [time in the sun], protect yourself, put some sunglasses on every time you go out. There's one thing we know, putting on a long sleeve shirt, putting on a hat and putting some sunglasses on is only going to do you well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So I wish I could tell myself... still go about your life but look after yourself.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the thing he hopes comes out of his journey and his advocacy - making skin checks and dermatologist appointments more accessible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chambers said: 'It was very difficult to get a booking... and I was a little bit anxious during that period to get more information. I would love nothing more than to have skin checks available to the people that need it and can't afford it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's an easy thing to do. It's a quick scan. It shouldn't have to be hundreds of dollars and a wait for three weeks when you're looking at some skin cancers that can actually wipe you out in six months. It's a huge thing. So let's just have that.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Annual full-body skin checks are recommended to spot skin cancer early, but people can perform self-checks periodically at home and visit a dermatologist sooner if they find anything suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;When conducting a self-exam, people should be on the look out for the ABCDEs of skin cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When conducting a self-check, people should be on the look out for the ABCDEs of skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A is for asymmetry: Is the mole symmetrical all the way around? Melanomas are often uneven and have different sized and shaped halves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;B is for border: Does the mole have clear borders? Melanomas are more likely to have irregular or jagged edges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;C is for color: Is the color the same throughout the mole? Melanomas are more likely to have multiple shades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;D is for diameter: How big is the mole? Typically they should be the size of the end of a pencil and melanomas tend to be larger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lastly, E is for evolving: Has the mole changed over time? Most benign moles stay the same year-to-year, but melanomas can grow in size and shape and change colors over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 05:38:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPV1VpT3piWXJPMjNSbjJ1UDVzdmc3MzRpcHBybzhfVmdhVWpVRERsQi1ZRlpkMjB5blVlNmNpcXByWTFVU3RyYWhBa1c4TWVYLXU1UFBlSjhzN3RkNDhfVkJ2aklNUmYxYVVZX3V4SlBXNFp6R2lrTno3dkhBTUNLbzFlOFQyVVFvR0l4bC12aTlra1lybFdwWC1aZERERVFTY0Fn0gGoAUFVX3lxTFBVOFhFYnUtblR5RkxOeDcxajd1UWhxVDE3bXh2ODJ5VWpSWHNMakFyeDJSYlFSWmp6NDZ0ODdkeC1JUmZUOXFFcDQ4Um1nY0U1STJNaER3Vl8xaDAtWkx3YldabTN5SWw1R25lYTBiOTFYa01hbDlub2JCNG41TjVQYVo2ZzM0MW55WDM1a0ZUYW5JYzZpcnhJbmNOVGRDNlN6czM4aHhIWQ</guid></item><item><title>维生素D ：每天应该摄入多少才能保持健康-印度时报 | Vitamin D: How much should be consumed daily to stay healthy - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi8AFBVV95cUxNMnd0MWxHY1U3NzNOc21UQWlWVEs5NUwxX0x4YjU1andlLWtYUndQMGVVVy1lWGRXdVRBbGJJMTJEcnFRVnBudE9MOVpyMzZBalNWY19ueEhod3ZGQzJqcXYycURPa0NHWVY0cW5oUGRZbV9XcVN4Q0NVZEU0d2JLcFprSU5aWlpSWkVZbjhETEJ6R3pUcmo4aExPaEZJUlRCNG5SczdWeUs0M1hEaG9fS3JrQnRwQmlFTnUzRE05VlFuWGdTWDdrSVdpekpXNUV1U0M1YXNJWnFWMXp4ZnZYeVEwY3piVEcyZlZlRGlzaEQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your mom is right (as always)!

Vitamin D, also known as the ‘sunshine vitamin’, plays a critical role in bone health, immune function, and overall well-being. Vitamin D deficiency is a major global public health problem affecting approximately 1 billion people.Nearly 50% of some populations experience vitamin D insufficiency. A deficiency can result in various health concerns, most notably rickets in children and osteoporosis in adults. While you can get vitamin D from sunlight and your diet, you may need&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/6-important-supplements-that-people-should-start-taking-in-their-30s-to-live-a-long-and-healthy-life/articleshow/120826074.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;supplementation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in case of deficiency. Understanding the right dosage depending on age, lifestyle, and individual health needs is important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we delve into the dosage, let’s take a look at why vitamin D is important for health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What is vitamin D?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is a fat-soluble nutrient essential for maintaining healthy bones, supporting immune function, and promoting overall well-being. It mainly exists in two forms: Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), derived from plant sources and fortified foods, and Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), produced by the skin when exposed to sunlight and found in animal-based foods such as salmon, cod, and egg yolks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium, promotes strong bones, and prevents conditions like osteoporosis. It also supports immune system function and potentially reduces the risk of infections and chronic diseases, such as autoimmune diseases and certain cancers. Emerging studies also hint at vitamin D's role in influencing mood, cardiovascular health, and muscle function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you believe getting sunlight is essential for maintaining good health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What are the natural sources of vitamin D?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body can create vitamin D from direct sunlight on the skin when outdoors. To prevent vitamin D deficiency, aim to get about 15 to 20 minutes of sunshine &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3068797/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;daily,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; with over 40% of skin exposed. Other sources of food include oily fish such as salmon, sardines, herring, and mackerel, red meat, liver (not suitable for pregnant women), egg yolks, and fortified foods such as some fat spreads and breakfast cereals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Prince Harry BLASTED For ‘Deadly’ Claims About Royal Family – Friends OUTRAGED Over King Charles Health Reveal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How much vitamin D do you need?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of vitamin D you need each day depends on your age. Children from age 1, adults, pregnant and breastfeeding women need 10 micrograms (mcg) of vitamin D a day. Infants up to the age of 1 year require 8.5 to 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day. Adults over 70 require 20 micrograms to support bone health. To know if you have a vitamin D deficiency, you can consult your healthcare provider, who would run blood tests that measure levels of storage vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 05:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi8AFBVV95cUxNMnd0MWxHY1U3NzNOc21UQWlWVEs5NUwxX0x4YjU1andlLWtYUndQMGVVVy1lWGRXdVRBbGJJMTJEcnFRVnBudE9MOVpyMzZBalNWY19ueEhod3ZGQzJqcXYycURPa0NHWVY0cW5oUGRZbV9XcVN4Q0NVZEU0d2JLcFprSU5aWlpSWkVZbjhETEJ6R3pUcmo4aExPaEZJUlRCNG5SczdWeUs0M1hEaG9fS3JrQnRwQmlFTnUzRE05VlFuWGdTWDdrSVdpekpXNUV1U0M1YXNJWnFWMXp4ZnZYeVEwY3piVEcyZlZlRGlzaEQ</guid></item><item><title>“我减了那么多体重，我丈夫认为我患有绝症” ：为什么人们对服用Ozempic撒谎？ -《卫报》 | ‘I lost so much weight, my husband thought I was terminally ill’: why do people lie about taking Ozempic? - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxOQS1Ra2t2c3BOZm0zenJLQlBSb2tLNlpkYV93SV84UUs0Wm5aTzU1TGVPcExWUEg1VHBYeW14WnVGZ21Za3FxcV83em5jLUhSdmJNaHNrVG5TbTBxNG4wRjQwUWpYWWc5WDllNmNDX3ZXazhyVzlhSjBheHpBdUZ6UVFQbmlJTHdUc0c0b19jWFVZRFJNczlCQzNVajRoaFNadFhLWVkyV3QwOFFOZWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;very Friday night, Claire, a 50-year-old woman in Berkshire, waits until her husband and son have gone to bed. When she is sure the house is quiet, she tiptoes out to her garage, and over to a tin tucked away in the corner. It is chilly out there, but she doesn’t mind; that’s the point. Inside the tin, away from the prying eyes of her family, is a vial of the GLP-1 medication Mounjaro, which needs to be kept at about 8C. Claire has been taking it without them knowing for several months. “It would have been harder to get away with in summer,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As weight-loss medications have become more and more popular, lots of people in the public eye have been dramatically changing shape, walking the red carpets or hosting TV shows in bodies half the size they once were. But as the jabs have become cheaper and more readily available, so, too, have ordinary people been disappearing before our eyes. And many are choosing not to disclose just how this weight loss is happening. Like Claire, these “secret jabbers” are keeping it private even from their closest family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","type":"Keyword","title":"Life and style"},{"id":"society/obesity","type":"Keyword","title":"Obesity"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","type":"Keyword","title":"Health &amp;amp; wellbeing"},{"id":"science/drugs","type":"Keyword","title":"Drugs"},{"id":"society/mental-health","type":"Keyword","title":"Mental health"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/diets-dieting","type":"Keyword","title":"Diets and dieting"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"profile/imogen-west-knights","type":"Contributor","title":"Imogen West-Knights","twitterHandle":"ImogenWK","bylineImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2023/04/18/Imogen_West-Knights.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=dedebf864eb3746c84962e71c1d8777a","bylineLargeImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2023/04/18/Imogen_West-Knights.png?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=cea49d83b6d59a7effd588f938555f32"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/saturday","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"Saturday"},{"id":"theguardian/saturday/features","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"Features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/saturday-magazine","type":"Tracking","title":"Saturday Magazine"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"lifeandstyle/2025/may/11/weight-loss-drugs-why-do-people-lie-about-taking-ozempic","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","switches":{"lightbox":true,"externalVideoEmbeds":true,"personaliseSignInGateAfterCheckout":true,"abSignInGateMainVariant":true,"prebidAppnexusUkRow":true,"prebidMagnite":true,"commercialMetrics":true,"prebidTrustx":true,"scAdFreeBanner":false,"adaptiveSite":true,"prebidPermutiveAudience":true,"compareVariantDecision":false,"enableSentryReporting":true,"lazyLoadContainers":true,"ampArticleSwitch":false,"remarketing":true,"articleEndSlot":true,"keyEventsCarousel":true,"registerWithPhone":false,"darkModeWeb":true,"targeting":true,"remoteHeader":true,"slotBodyEnd":true,"ampPrebidOzone":false,"extendedMostPopularFronts":true,"emailInlineInFooter":true,"showNewPrivacyWordingOnEmailSignupEmbeds":true,"prebidAnalytics":true,"extendedMostPopular":true,"ampContentAbTesting":false,"prebidCriteo":true,"abPrebidId5":false,"imrWorldwide":true,"acast":true,"twitterUwt":true,"abAuxiaSignInGate":true,"prebidAppnexusInvcode":true,"ampPrebidPubmatic":false,"a9HeaderBidding":true,"prebidAppnexus":true,"europeBetaFrontTest2":true,"enableDiscussionSwitch":true,"prebidXaxis":true,"stickyVideos":true,"interactiveFullHeaderSwitch":true,"discussionAllPageSize":true,"prebidUserSync":true,"audioOnwardJourneySwitch":true,"brazeTaylorReport":false,"callouts":true,"sentinelLogger":true,"geoMostPopular":true,"weAreHiring":false,"relatedContent":true,"thirdPartyEmbedTracking":true,"prebidOzone":true,"ampLiveblogSwitch":false,"ampAmazon":false,"prebidAdYouLike":true,"mostViewedFronts":true,"abA9BidResponseWinner":true,"optOutAdvertising":true,"abSignInGateMainControl":true,"googleSearch":true,"brazeSwitch":true,"prebidKargo":true,"consentManagement":true,"idProfileNavigation":true,"confiantAdVerification":true,"discussionAllowAnonymousRecommendsSwitch":false,"absoluteServerTimes":false,"permutive":true,"comscore":true,"ampPrebidCriteo":false,"prebidTheTradeDesk":true,"newsletterOnwards":false,"youtubeIma":true,"webFonts":true,"liveBlogTopSponsorship":true,"lineItemJobs":true,"ophan":true,"crosswordSvgThumbnails":true,"prebidTriplelift":true,"prebidPubmatic":true,"serverShareCounts":false,"autoRefresh":true,"enhanceTweets":true,"prebidIndexExchange":true,"prebidOpenx":true,"prebidHeaderBidding":true,"idCookieRefresh":true,"discussionPageSize":true,"smartAppBanner":false,"historyTags":true,"brazeContentCards":true,"remoteBanner":true,"emailSignupRecaptcha":true,"prebidSmart":true,"shouldLoadGoogletag":true,"inizio":true,"europeBetaFront":true,"prebidBidCache":true},"contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;All over social media, accounts and posts are cropping up focusing on the experience of being on GLP-1 injections (the clinical name for&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic, Mounjaro and Wegovy), but keeping it hidden. There are Reddit sub-chats where secret jabbers share their tips, such as where to stash the medication to keep up the ruse and also keep it cool. People describe hiding it inside a mascara box in their makeup fridge, in a wine cooler, at the back of the salad drawer, inside a bottle of a protein drink they know no one else in their family is interested in trying. Users also share the lies they have told to disguise being on the medication – new gym routines, a dislike for dessert – and bond over the complications that arise from their nearest and dearest not knowing why they’re suddenly dropping weight. “My husband started to think I was terminally ill,” one TikTok commenter confesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Why are people so keen to hide their weight-loss medication? Why go to such lengths to keep something so seemingly inconsequential so private? I talked to some secret jabbers, in strictest anonymity, to find out what’s behind their choice to keep stumm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;laire started to notice a few years ago that her weight was making it more and more difficult for her to move around. When she decided to start GLP-1 injections, she told her osteopath and a small handful of close friends, but not her husband. “It wasn’t fear of his reaction,” she says, “but I’m an extremely private person when it comes to my thought processes. And for me, this one ran really deep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She got her jabs from a private online pharmacy. In the early weeks, the tin in the garage was good enough cover for her secret. But it eventually became untenable to keep her medication under wraps because Claire’s husband does most of their cooking. “I haven’t been hungry since mid-November,” she says, “so my husband was cooking the same stuff and I was starting to struggle to eat it. I got away with it for about six weeks with comments like, ‘Yeah, I’m not very hungry tonight’, so he started to serve up a bit less. But even then I was leaving half a meal, which was already two-thirds of the size of what he’d been serving me before.” It was the food waste that got to him, Claire says. “He was quite frustrated. He said, ‘I don’t know what you’re doing. You seem to be trying to eat less or something.’ And there was no getting around it once it was obvious.” She decided to come clean. “I was like, well, since you ask, I have been on this weight-loss medication for the last month and a half … ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;We would never berate anyone for giving up smoking, but do we call it cheating if they use nicotine tabs?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He took it well. “He was surprised, I think, and bemused. Ultimately, the words that came out were, ‘Oh, well, that makes sense. Why didn’t you tell me?’ Once it was out there, it was a non-event.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Eliza, also 50, has been on Mounjaro for seven months. She lives in North Yorkshire, works for a large charity and has a beloved cat who walks across her keyboard while we chat.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;She’s had a hard few years. Her brother and her mum both died, and grief on top of menopause meant that she went from always feeling as if she was a little heavier than she would like to a more sustained kind of weight gain. Initially, she didn’t tell anybody she was going on GLP-1s, although she has recently confided in one friend also taking Mounjaro. Neither of them have told their husbands. “I was at their house having dinner recently and her husband was like, ‘Oh, you ladies are looking very slim.’ I’m finding it slightly problematic now,” she admits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Eliza thought her husband probably wouldn’t understand why she wanted to go down the GLP-1 route, because he’s such an “eat less and move around more kind of guy”. She doesn’t actively hide the medication from him, though; she just keeps it in the fridge and knows he won’t notice. “It’s amazing how unobservant people are,” she says. This isn’t the first time she has hidden a weight-loss management attempt from her husband. “I went to Turkey and had a gastric balloon, and I didn’t tell anyone, not even him,” she says. “I just pretended that I was going to London for a meeting and then popped off to Turkey. It’s actually quite wild,” she says, almost surprised at herself. The gastric balloon didn’t work, so she turned to weight-loss injections. She gets them from an online pharmacy, for £160 a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="84c21128-2fd9-42fc-974d-c460866d6ef2" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Illustration: Fran Pulido/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Moira, 55, in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the Cotswolds, started taking Mounjaro in October and also hasn’t told anybody, including her husband. “Over the past few years, I’ve gone through lots of different treatments, with menopause, HRT and patches and stuff, so he’s used to seeing things come into the house but not really asking many questions,” she says. He and her mum have both commented on her new shape. “They’ve noticed, but they’ve not really put two and three together to make four or five or seven,” as she puts it.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Now I’ve got to this point, I can’t really come clean,” she says. Moira has lost 10kg (22lb).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cameron, a retired opera enthusiast in central London, is single, but made a decision early on in his GLP-1 journey that he wouldn’t be telling his closest friend, or his parents. “Even as a 58-year-old man, my parents’ opinion matters, because it makes life easier if they’re not being ignorant, judgmental and shortsighted,” he says. He worries that they’d say it’s dangerous, or “they would be judgmentally dismissive. They’d be like, ‘Well, you’re not doing it &lt;em&gt;properly&lt;/em&gt;.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This idea of “doing it properly” is a pervasive one. For decades, people have had the idea that weight loss must involve hard work: consistent, difficult exercise and sacrificing pleasures such as delicious meals. The willpower involved is seen as admirable; the idea – which has been debunked by research into obesity – is that anyone can have a slim body, if they only try hard enough. By contrast, using injections to lose weight is perceived as easy, even “lazy”, and unworthy of the praise that gets lavished on people who are seen to have changed their bodies through sacrifice alone. Perhaps this is why people are keeping their jabs to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cameron doesn’t lie about it per se, but he’s come close. He is using Mounjaro, rather than the similarly popular Wegovy. “My sister-in-law asked me. She said, ‘You’re not taking Wegovy, are you?’ And I said, ‘No, I wouldn’t even consider it.’ Because I’m not, and I wouldn’t. If she had asked me the right question, I would have said, ‘Absolutely I am’ but I only have to answer the question she asked,” he says with a wry smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="566f316b-8f65-4a34-b91f-558fb64946cd" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":16,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"‘Plot twist - I’m still a fat person!’: meet the people proving you can be fit at any size","elementId":"566f316b-8f65-4a34-b91f-558fb64946cd","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/mar/29/im-still-a-fat-person-meet-the-people-proving-you-can-be-fit-at-any-size"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Gail Bohin, a clinical psychologist for the NHS’s specialist weight management service in Gloucestershire, says this idea that people on GLP-1s are “cheating” is widespread. “It’s all tied up with a bigger picture of living in a weight stigmatising culture, because people are seen as personally responsible for gaining weight, and then the association of that is: it’s your fault that you became diabetic, or that your joints are playing up. People use phrases such as ‘soft options’ or ‘easy get-out’ about GLP-1s, which just shows the underlying attitude that it is completely within your control to fix this and you should just try harder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“At the end of the day, I have dieted,” Jasmine says. “I’m just not getting that interference of being hungry all the time.” In her mid-60s, she has been on Mounjaro for almost a year and kept it secret from everybody except her husband, despite significant visible weight loss. “You can’t lose this much weight without people wanting to know what you’ve been doing,” she says. No one has asked her outright if she’s on GLP-1s, and she’s not sure what she’d say if they did. “I would have problems lying,” she says. “I could do it if I was on The Traitors, but that’s a game and this is my life.” So far, she’s been saying that she’s radically changed her diet – but not that GLP-1s are the reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Secret-jabbers all fear judgment, and other people’s opinions colouring their own view of whether the drug suits their needs. “I come from a family who are very opinionated,” Moira says. “My husband and mum can be critical without realising, and that can prevent you from making good choices about changing your life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;aulo is in his 30s, in a job that brings him into contact with the fashion world, where GLP-1 is a hot topic these days. He has been on Wegovy for six months and decided early on that he wanted to tell as many people as possible what he was doing. “I almost want to get it out of the way before someone says something mean about it. Like, ‘Oh God, how lazy are people who take Ozempic?’ I’ve already had someone refuse to talk to me, because he says he was so disappointed that I was taking it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s reactions like this that made Jasmine want to keep her Mounjaro use a secret. She stayed with some family friends recently, one of whom had been taking Ozempic. “Everyone was being quite derogatory about the fact that she had resorted to medication to help her lose weight,” she says. “Behind her back they would say she shouldn’t really be taking it. Yet to her face, everyone was saying, ‘Oh wow, you look fab.’ So I began to pick up on the fact that there was this duality in how people responded to you when you were taking it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This word “resort” comes up again and again. There is an element of shame for some people, embarrassment that they have had to somehow stoop to taking medication for weight loss instead of achieving it by “natural” means such as exercise and dieting. If not ashamed about the drug itself, some users feel ashamed about being overweight in the first place. “I think: why can’t my willpower do it?” Jasmine says. “But then I know that I’ve been using willpower and it hasn’t worked.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;With diets, all you do is think about food: what to cook, how to prepare it. And the one thing you want to do is to stop thinking about food&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For Eliza, it’s not shame about the jab. “I feel ashamed about being fat,” she says. “Because that is the literal point of fat shaming: that if you don’t look like &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/naomi-campbell" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Naomi Campbell&lt;/a&gt;, you are some kind of bad person. So I told nobody.” But as she has visibly lost more weight, she has found the “web expanding”, as she puts it, of people she is having to deceive about the reason. Over Christmas, her husband asked her outright whether she was using weight-loss injections and she told him no. “Now, all of a sudden, people are definitely noticing, so that has been very awkward and difficult, because I just didn’t know what to say. I’ve been kind of fudging it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The dominant cultural narrative seems to be that we want people with bigger bodies to suffer in some way if they want to lose weight, Paulo says. “Society hates fat people so much that there is this real belief that they should be punished in the process of shedding their weight. Like, you should be in the gym every day sweating away and kind of crying the fat off.” He thinks there is something of a cultural panic going on about Ozempic, because it has allowed some significantly overweight people to choose to lose that weight without “hard work”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We view people who are overweight as having failed at something,” Claire says, “that if only they’d been a little bit stronger their whole life, they’d be able to overcome it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;r Julia Mueller, a researcher at the University of Cambridge who specialises in the psychosocial determinants of obesity and weight management, tells me she’s “really saddened” to hear that people feel they need to keep their injections secret. “But not at all surprised. The narrative around these weight-loss medications, on social media, in general media, even from some healthcare professionals, has often been very stigmatising: that it’s an easy way out, a quick fix.” She worries that the secrecy puts an extra psychological pressure on those trying to lose weight: “I think anyone who’s ever kept a secret, especially from someone they’re close to, knows it’s difficult and requires effort.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The secret jabbers tell me they’re happy on the drugs, and about the life-changing difference it has made thus far. People speak about their lifelong inability to turn off the voice in their head, often referred to as “food noise”, that was constantly asking what they would eat next and whether it would be OK to eat it. GLP-1s, everyone says, have finally turned off that voice. “It’s one of the biggest ironies there is in the whole weight and diet industry,” Jasmine says. “I’m a veteran of Slimming World and Weight Watchers, and all you do is think about food. What can I cook? How can I prepare this food? When you go shopping, you’re constantly looking at labels. And the one thing you want to do is to stop thinking about food.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="b56d3265-16d2-4c1e-9372-2b74ea0641ab" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":31,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"The end of WeightWatchers?

But I was 30. I couldn’t sustain my weight coming out of a car and I fell on to the road. I thought: this is getting out of hand.” He was then diagnosed with pre-diabetes. Since being on Wegovy, he has done a cardiovascular test which showed that his risk of heart failure has more than halved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cameron tells a similar story. “I don’t feel out of breath walking up and down two flights of stairs. It used to be I would walk five minutes, I’d be soaked through. That’s not the case now. All of my bloods are better, my liver function is better, my body fat is down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Two of the people I speak to use the analogy of quitting smoking to counter the idea that taking a drug to help lose weight for medical reasons is in some way a cop-out. “We would never berate anyone for giving up smoking, but do we call it cheating if they use nicotine tabs?” Claire says. “For me, it’s a direct parallel.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Perhaps it’s no surprise that people choose to keep their use of GLP-1 medication secret, given the sensitivity of weight as a subject. It should be none of our business whether someone else chooses to take weight loss medication or doesn’t, exercises or doesn’t, eats more or less, weighs more or less. It should be a personal choice made for personal reasons, subject to no judgment from anybody else. We don’t live in that world, unfortunately, and so the secret jabbers find themselves stuck: damned if they do, and damned if they don’t. As Jasmine puts it, “You may deride someone for being overweight, but when they take a medication to resolve that issue, you deride them for doing something about it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some details have been changed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxOQS1Ra2t2c3BOZm0zenJLQlBSb2tLNlpkYV93SV84UUs0Wm5aTzU1TGVPcExWUEg1VHBYeW14WnVGZ21Za3FxcV83em5jLUhSdmJNaHNrVG5TbTBxNG4wRjQwUWpYWWc5WDllNmNDX3ZXazhyVzlhSjBheHpBdUZ6UVFQbmlJTHdUc0c0b19jWFVZRFJNczlCQzNVajRoaFNadFhLWVkyV3QwOFFOZWc</guid></item><item><title>一位专业跑步教练- Fit&amp;Well说，我曾经在跑步时与膝盖疼痛作斗争，直到我做出这四个改变。 | I used to struggle with knee pain when I ran until I made these four changes, says an expert running coach - Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi4wFBVV95cUxQeUwzeXJEc2Q3Mkd4M3Q3TUhwXzN3RFItaWxZU2hlSHhKalFDYUUydmRyamZTN1lJS0ptZHE5bGxCSkpBaW5ZYXh2TXBDMFZsUWV1ajRWWHhRZTVPclY0OVFiR0plWFd3a0hVXzVsZzM2Z1FJd2VlOFQxVEI2eTR1NHZEYkpmLVdNa3pyWjViUU03d0ZxVUFyeTNaRXlQeEVEYnRzLTVRLW1aSEgtOHlkWmZGazdfdkNaMmJuVE8xMEVuY2hweUh2WHpuYUE5VlF3VGJ1c3JTRVM2bmVDb00yMTlpdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to approach your first marathon: the smart way and the hard way. Six years ago, personal trainer James Stirling—better known as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://londonfitnessguy.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://londonfitnessguy.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;London Fitness Guy&lt;/a&gt;—chose the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I trained—or, more accurately, didn't train as well as I should have—for the London Marathon in 2019 that’s when I first suffered with knee pain,” he tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For me, it has always been a case of overuse and I think that is the most common cause of knee pain. It’s doing mileage your body is not adapted to or running too fast too soon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That wake-up call prompted Stirling to train as a running coach so that he, and his clients, wouldn’t repeat the same mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, having just completed the Berlin Half Marathon—one of six races in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.superhalfs.com/en/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.superhalfs.com/en/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;SuperHalfs series&lt;/a&gt; he plans to complete over the next two years—Stirling says he’s taking a far more patient, comprehensive and long-term approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the four changes he made to prevent knee pain and run injury-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-strength-train"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Strength train&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introducing running-specific strength training has been the biggest game changer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ngpAK9yKXXo4iKTHzi2gsX" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ngpAK9yKXXo4iKTHzi2gsX slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Strength training a lot more according to running has definitely helped,” says Stirling. Instead of biceps curls and crunches, Stirling has tailored his workouts to build his body’s ability to withstand the repetitive impact and unilateral demands of running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been implementing a lot more single-leg work, plyometrics and running-specific moves,” says Stirling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typical workout during a block of running training will almost always include some variation on lunges to work one side of the body at a time, calf raises to strengthen the critical &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Soleus" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Soleus" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;soleus muscle&lt;/a&gt; of the lower leg, and pogo hops to create resilience through the feet, ankles and knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-start-training-early"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Start training early &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need time on your side when training for a race. “Most injuries seem to occur when people are racing towards a deadline of race day without giving themselves enough time to prepare,” says Stirling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I actually haven't had knee pain in any of my recent runs, which is great, but it’s because my training is now patient.” It’s typically recommended to give yourself at least 12 weeks to train for a half marathon, for example, but if you’re completely new to running you should give yourself an even longer runway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Giving yourself a wide timescale that allows you to train patiently will hopefully help you avoid unnecessary injury,” Stirling says. “Paired with strength training, that’s a real winning combination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-build-gradually"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Build gradually &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stirling also swears by the 10% rule: increase your total running mileage by no more than 10% per week. Think of it like incrementally increasing the weight you lift in the gym or number of reps you perform during home workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If tracking your weekly mileage across all your runs is too complicated, Stirling says you can apply this rule to your longest run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you build the weekly mileage of your longest run by a maximum of 10% each week it should help to prevent overuse and reduce the risk of injury, while providing enough of a challenge to improve your fitness week on week,” says Stirling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-4-go-slow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. Go slow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Stirling spends a lot more time doing zone 2 training—training at 60 to 70% of his maximum heart rate—especially during the longest run of his week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zone 2 training can improve aerobic fitness, helping faster runs feel easier. This slower pace will also reduce the impact on your joints and stress on your cardiovascular system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I always encourage running clients to think about every training session as a stress on the body,” says Stirling. “If you run three times over the course of a week and each one is high stress, the body is going to struggle to adapt.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Stirling says, you must include easy runs in your week. “The stress on the body of the easy session is significantly less than if you're doing high-speed intervals multiple times. It’s about balancing that stress efficiently to avoid injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to stay injury-free, slow and steady wins the race. Think tortoise, not hare.&lt;/p&gt;

This progressive disorder leads to gradual damage in the brain, which ultimately affects motor control and cognition, as noted by the National Health Service (NHS). In the UK alone, approximately 145,000 people are living with Parkinson's disease, according to Parkinson's UK, a charity dedicated to the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="top2brdiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that those living within a mile of golf courses have 126% higher risk of developing Parkinson's disease than those who live more than six miles away, according to a new study published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2833716" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to know more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the study say?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research has revealed a concerning link between living in close proximity to golf courses and an increased risk of developing Parkinson’s disease. Specifically, individuals residing within a mile of a golf course may see their risk of this debilitating neurodegenerative disorder more than double. Researchers from the Barrow Neurological Institute in Arizona conducted a comprehensive analysis of health records from residents near 139 golf courses located in southern Minnesota and western Wisconsin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from 711 municipal wells provided by the Minnesota Geospatial Information Office was also used to determine the correlation between proximity and prevalence of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the study, 450 incident cases from 1991 to 2015 were identified in Olmsted County, Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The odds of PD were relatively constant within close proximity to a golf course and decreased linearly as distance increased; individuals living farther from a golf course had reduced odds of PD, decreasing relative to the distance from the nearest golf course," the study explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have already linked chemicals found in pesticides including paraquat and rotenone to neurodegeneration, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Brittany Krzyzanowski, one of the authors of the study published in the journal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40338549/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, emphasized the potential role of pesticides utilized to maintain golf courses in this heightened risk. She stated, “These findings suggest that pesticides applied to golf courses may play a role in the incidence of Parkinson’s disease for nearby residents.” The researchers advocate for public health initiatives aimed at minimizing both groundwater contamination and airborne pesticide exposure from golf course maintenance to mitigate the risk of Parkinson’s disease in adjacent neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the findings?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's findings are particularly striking: individuals living within a mile of these courses have a 126% elevated chance of being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in comparison to those who live more than six miles away. The research revealed a consistent trend, indicating that the likelihood of developing the disease diminishes by 13% for every additional mile of distance from the golf course, suggesting a clear, linear relationship between proximity to golf courses and Parkinson's risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Areas that shared drinking water supplies with water used near golf courses were the most greatly impacted, the study shows. Researchers believe this shows that the pesticides used on golf courses could contribute to the number of Parkinson's cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study further revealed alarming statistics regarding drinking water sources; individuals who receive their water from areas near a golf course are nearly twice as likely to develop Parkinson's disease compared to those whose water sources are unaffected by such proximity. Certain pesticides, notably paraquat and rotenone, have been associated with the onset of Parkinson-like neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to tackle:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per the Parkinson's Foundation, cases have been higher in areas such as the Rust Belt, which includes parts of the Midwest. Cases are also high in Southern California, Southeastern Texas, Central Pennsylvania, and Florida, according to the foundation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="last8brdiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the context of pesticide regulation, it is important to note that both the UK and EU have stringent controls in place, including a ban on paraquat due to its significant health and environmental concerns. Dr. Katherine Fletcher, Research Lead at Parkinson's UK, noted that, for most individuals in the UK, the risk of pesticide exposure leading to Parkinson’s is “extremely low.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="last7brdiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="last6brdiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings of this study buttress the association between pesticide exposure and Parkinson’s disease, Dr. Fletcher cautioned that the underlying causes of the condition are complex and multifaceted, likely involving a combination of genetic predispositions and environmental influences. Numerous investigations have sought to determine the extent to which pesticide exposure may elevate the risk of Parkinson’s across various populations globally, producing mixed results overall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="last5brdiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="last4brdiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She remarked, “While this study supports the association between pesticides and Parkinson's, it is somewhat simplistic and does not fully account for other potential exposure routes, such as occupational pesticide contact, nor does it consider genetic factors that may predispose individuals to the condition.” The study opens up further dialogue about the broader implications of pesticide use and public health, particularly in the context of environmental safety and community health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="last3brdiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="last2brdiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="last1brdiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 02:29:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-gFBVV95cUxPdTlmTEhwRlY1aktGMDNwRUxtWHBwNC1fbnVKU3RrUEY0WldYdjNlTVF4OFAwY3VYTnJUNUExamhfSW15UzFDeFV5RU5ucUhDTnV5cE1XQ2dKc1N4YmZDdVZqbGxYUVcxV2pGM0pVbjMwRlYzRTF5d3AzWmxxaWZWN09TZm1kMW1hdDZlWF9qR3lPU2tqWkEzSVhOSUZGMXNXOTVadGd2bDJMb0RiMi1BS0Q1czYwTExVelMydFV2LW9rZ1NEUTF3SzZ3ZFJqdzBUUXRpNXpBSVByX0JPN0hvdkk1SnY1RWN4TTFmU0drbnlmWlMwTzJBODVn0gH_AUFVX3lxTE9XRnJWOFNfQXFBeFdldVhLZTVfSDBndHd1ZUtxckNDcVFNRzNyVU5sT1ZTaWdNcy1xdldaRnFOWVUtdWRONi1vX0NrS29GNUIwVmZZYm1lWWZTMXF0N3ZvV3NPaHRQaG0zcFJZeWFqY29oUlBsekFRaVMweTNSNEJFZW1qRlEzMGk2cFFZNW8wSnRnZ05OWHBSUXpKX2xCTDZjOXdOc0J3dllJNGFKQ3l0d0V4UUlBWUR1ZDVHRFo2d05XeGpSZC1PTUJtODJzSWFJaWJvM0RtdDUxUG1xVHU0N2ZnX00tZ21OUHBMVDhjODFGekd4Tmd0Zm9NVEN6SQ</guid></item><item><title>住在高尔夫球场附近会导致帕金森氏症吗？新研究揭示了-印度时报 | Can living near golf courses give you Parkinson's?

			&lt;p&gt;Intermittent fasting is not only a &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0314685"&gt;useful tool for weight loss&lt;/a&gt;, it's also shown to have &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.22065"&gt;many benefits for metabolic health&lt;/a&gt; – independent of weight loss. Yet many people may find intermittent fasting to be a challenge, especially if following the 5:2 version of the diet where calories are severely restricted two days a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-025-03646-5"&gt;my latest study&lt;/a&gt; shows that you don't need to severely restrict your calories to get the metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting. Even just restricting the number of carbs you eat twice a week may be enough to improve your metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intermittent fasting appears to be so beneficial for health because of the way it alters our metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a meal, our body enters the postprandial state. While in this state, our metabolism pushes our cells to use carbohydrates for immediate energy, while storing some of these carbs as well as fat for later use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after several hours without food, in the postabsorptive "fasted" state, our metabolism switches to using some of our fat stores for energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this regard, intermittent fasting ensures a better balance between the sources it uses for energy. This leads to &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/edrv/article/39/4/489/4982126?login=true"&gt;improved metabolic flexibility&lt;/a&gt;, which is linked with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0026049518302294?via%253Dihub"&gt;better cardiometabolic health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, this means lower risk of cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance and type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="160617" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleagues and I previously ran a study to demonstrate the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26819200/"&gt;effects of a fast&lt;/a&gt; on the body. We observed that following a day of both total fasting or severe calorie restriction (eating around only 25 percent of each person's daily calorie requirements), the body was better at clearing and burning the fat of a full English breakfast the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fasting shifted the body from using carbs to using fat. This effect carried on both during the fast and the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29508693/"&gt;Our research&lt;/a&gt; has also compared the effects of intermittent fasting to a calorie-matched or calorie-restricted diet. Both groups followed the diet until they lost 5 percent of their body weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite both groups losing the same 5 percent of body weight, and at the same rate, the intermittent fasting group had greater improvements in their metabolic handling, similar to what we saw in the previous trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.22345"&gt;Other researchers&lt;/a&gt; who have compared the effects of the 5:2 variant of the intermittent fasting diet to a calorie-matched, calorie-restricted diet have also found fasting is beneficial for metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_160624" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160624" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/IllustratedExamplesOfCarbohydrateRichFoods.jpg" alt="illustration of donut, pasta, rice, potatoes, banana and other carbohydrate rich foods" class="wp-image-160624 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/IllustratedExamplesOfCarbohydrateRichFoods.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/IllustratedExamplesOfCarbohydrateRichFoods-466x415.jpg 466w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/IllustratedExamplesOfCarbohydrateRichFoods-600x535.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-160624" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Examples of carbohydrate-rich foods. (Elena Shlyuykova/iStock/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Metabolic health benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why exactly is intermittent fasting &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34589208/"&gt;so beneficial for metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;? This is a question I sought to answer in &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-025-03646-5"&gt;my latest study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people who follow the 5:2 intermittent fasting diet, typical fasting days are, by their nature, very low in calories – equating to only a few hundred calories per day. Because people are consuming so few calories on fasting days, it also means they're consuming very few carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the postprandial state is governed by carbohydrate availability, this begged the question as to whether it's the calorie restriction or the carbohydrate restriction that's creating the metabolic effect when intermittent fasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recruited 12 overweight and obese participants. Participants were first given a very low-carb diet one day. Another day, they were given a severely calorie-restricted diet (around 75 percent fewer calories than they'd normally eat).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After each fasting day, we gave them a high-fat, high-sugar meal (similar to an English breakfast) to see how easily their bodies burned fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we found was that the shift to fat burning and improved fat handling of the high-calorie meal were near identical following both the traditional calorie-restricted "fast" day and the low-carb day. In other words, restricting carbs can elicit the same favourable metabolic effects as fasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_160626" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160626" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/ExampleOfLowCarbMealEggSalad-e1746674085190.jpg" alt="Salad with egg, tomatoes, avocado and greens" class="size-full wp-image-160626" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-160626" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In our study, restricting carbs had the same favorable metabolic effects as fasting. (d3sign/Moment/Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be important now for more studies to be conducted using a larger cohort of participants to confirm these findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such findings may help us address some of the practical problems we face with intermittent fasting and traditional low-carb diets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For intermittent fasting diets, severe calorie restriction on fasting days can increase the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-018-0370-0"&gt;risk of nutritional deficiencies&lt;/a&gt; if not careful. It can similarly be a trigger for &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34191688/"&gt;disordered eating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strict carb restriction can also be &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0273422"&gt;challenging to adhere to long-term&lt;/a&gt;, and may lead to an &lt;a href="https://eating-disorders.org.uk/carbohydrate-phobia-go-enjoy-your-toast/"&gt;unhealthy fear of carbs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other limitation of both intermittent fasting and continuous carb restriction is that weight loss is a likely outcome. Hence these approaches are not universally beneficial for those who need to improve their health without losing weight or those looking to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21677272/"&gt;maintain their weight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now testing the feasibility of an intermittent carb restriction diet, or a low-carb 5:2. So instead of restricting calories two days a week, you would restrict the number of carbs you consume twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this is proven to be beneficial, it would offer the benefits of fasting without restricting calories on "fast" days.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/254752/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spring means allergy season across the country, and Illinois is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're noticing your allergies feeling worse than usual, you may not be alone. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.pollen.com/forecast/current/pollen/60610" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.pollen.com/forecast/current/pollen/60610"&gt;pollen.com&lt;/a&gt;, allergies are currently at a medium to high level. The site also listed maple, birch and ash as the top allergens. &lt;/p&gt;
			
	
&lt;p&gt;The increase in pollen and other allergens throughout the area can lead to uncomfortable symptoms including itchy eyes, running noses and more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tree pollen, grass pollen and mold also often aggravate symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are specific &lt;a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/chicago-area-allergies-pollen-counts-and-how-to-find-relief/3221674/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/chicago-area-allergies-pollen-counts-and-how-to-find-relief/3221674/"&gt;weather &lt;/a&gt;conditions where pollen counts can rise, and those counts can even fluctuate depending on the time of day. &lt;a href="https://www.zyrtec.com/allergy-guide/outdoors/best-times-low-pollen-count"&gt;According to Zyrtec&lt;/a&gt;, pollen counts can fluctuate throughout the day, and are generally highest in the midday hours. Pollen counts then typically decrease throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windy and warm conditions typically produce the highest pollen counts, and those who are sensitive to allergens are encouraged to limit outdoor activities during those times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what can you do to help? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help address allergies, experts recommend that people remove their clothes that they’ve worn outside, and to shower in the afternoon or evening to rinse pollen from skin and hair.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Taking allergy medications can also help, especially before periods where pollen counts are likely to be high, according &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hay-fever/in-depth/seasonal-allergies/art-20048343"&gt;to the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oral antihistamines, corticosteroid nasal sprays and cromolyn sodium nasal spray are all available over-the-counter, and can help reduce symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, if there’s a meal you don’t like, feel free to repeat a different recipe in this plan or browse more of our healthy &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/18314/cuisines-regions/mediterranean/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet recipes&lt;/a&gt; for additional inspiration. Because we created this meal plan with weight loss in mind, we set the calories at 1,500 calories per day and prioritized recipes high in protein and fiber that avoid added sugar. If you’re making a swap, you may want to select a recipe with a similar nutrition profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can eat the same breakfast or lunch every day if it’s easier for your routine. Breakfast options span about 300 to 350 calories. Most lunches are about 350 calories, with the exception of the sandwich on Day 1 that’s quite a bit higher at 534 calories. If you’re opting to eat that sandwich daily while also monitoring calories or other nutrients, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;What’s the difference between added and natural sugars?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Added sugar can go by several different names, including maple syrup, agave, high-fructose corn syrup, corn sugar and more. Added sugars have little nutritional value compared to other types of foods. Naturally occurring sugars are those found naturally in foods, such as fruits, vegetables and unsweetened dairy. Natural sugars don’t pose the same health risks as added sugars because these foods are also rich in nutrients like vitamins, minerals, protein and fiber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_173-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2058981/ultimate-mediterranean-diet-shopping-list/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; emphasizes a high intake of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, plant-based proteins, whole grains, fish, nuts and other healthy fats. It limits excess added sugars and ultra-processed foods, such as refined grains, sugar-sweetened beverages and packaged sweets. This healthy eating style is consistently praised for its health benefits and flexibility. While it emphasizes nutrient-rich foods, it doesn’t eliminate single food groups, which makes it easy to follow and more sustainable long-term. Following the Mediterranean diet is linked with a reduced risk of developing certain cancers, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The Mediterranean diet helps support healthy aging by reducing inflammation and prevent the onset of age-related healthy conditions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In this seven-day meal plan, we incorporate the principles of the Mediterranean diet while mapping out a reduced-calorie plan that emphasizes protein and fiber. These two nutrients can help you feel full, which may facilitate weight loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Each day provides at least 82 grams of protein and 30 grams of fiber.&lt;br&gt;
