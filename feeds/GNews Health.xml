I told my husband we have to put off trying for a baby again until we can move, and he said I was overreacting.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="V3O4FG6NARBLJK6MMPKWWXNPWI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;He was out of town when this happened, and I had only my younger sister with me. First, the ER of the small hospital nearest to us seemed to be in an absolute panic when I was first diagnosed. I thought it was because they were worried about my condition, but now I think they were scared to treat me. They transferred me to a much larger hospital via ambulance. Once I got to the second ER, they gave me some pain meds and then sent me to labor and delivery, where the obstetrician stopped the pain meds “in case the pregnancy was actually viable.” They let me sit for hours while I complained and worried about the pain getting worse and worse.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RWNEJPC5BBD25CECXBGNDYHTVA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;After I’d been there six hours, I convinced a nurse that the pain was so bad I couldn’t take it anymore; she arranged for an ultrasound that showed how bad things were, and I was rushed into surgery. When I was in recovery, I asked what took so long and the OB told me they were deciding what to do. What was there to decide?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2RUNDNUVO5CVZOVY6PAMDVG6IY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;We would still like to try for a baby, but I refuse to do it when I live in a state that treats women this way. Am I being unreasonable? I could have some PTSD from that experience, it’s true.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X7WCLDV5DNHZ5FCNUF34OW4PUQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scared: &lt;/b&gt;You are not overreacting, you are not being unreasonable. Your husband is speaking as someone who has never been told he can’t control his own body and can’t make his own medical decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3WIKWSJEG5EXPHTG4A3JW4CMAU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Restoring your bodily autonomy — better known by its street name, freedom — is one of the best reasons there is to relocate, so hold firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SG47IC6FDRE7FFPGYZ5GKIK7HQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Staying put to help grab the reins back from misogynist legislators is one of the best reasons to stay put, but you do not have the luxury of time to play the long game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4J5KXPXN7ZFDFCOSZNQRMB2JAU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Re: Post-Roe: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Carolyn, all due respect, but you were dancing around a pretty important point: HE.

I went too easy on the husband. I won’t even claim in my defense that I was lulled into it by the astonishing number of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/12/17/abortion-rights-state-ban/" target="_blank"&gt;legislators who are apparently okay with the deterioration in women’s health care&lt;/a&gt; since &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/series/post-roe-america" target="_blank"&gt;the overturning of &lt;i&gt;Roe&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LCV24F7CCBFTTLJRGT2U5NVWPY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Re: Post-Roe: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Given that being in a blue state is no guarantee medical professionals won’t also leave you hanging unless you forcefully advocate for yourself, I’d be questioning whether you really want to risk pregnancy under any circumstances with someone who’s so quick to dismiss your pain as “overreacting.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JJNL2K6WXZAANJTZU6NVCIX7NU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Questioning: &lt;/b&gt;Fair, thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CNVT7CJTS5AJZLWF7HLOYUS4H4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Re: Post-Roe: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Is it just possible the husband is downplaying the experience to cover up his fear of his wife having nearly died? I’m not saying that’s a good reason, but it might be his excuse.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZGY54TJJKJGYLAJMFYCQT6RQQ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anonymous: &lt;/b&gt;That’s the kindest possibility, thanks.

Here’s what to know.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DALLAS — Measles cases are spreading across Texas, with new warnings issued in San Antonio, New Braunfels and San Marcos. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of Health and Human Services reports 90 cases in the outbreak so far, with 16 patients hospitalized due to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some public health experts believe the number of actual cases is likely greater.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What you're seeing is the tip of the iceberg," said Dr. Diana Cervantes, Associate Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the University of North Texas Health Science Center.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is "probably the most infectious contagious disease on the planet," said Dr. Suzanne Whitworth,  Division Chief of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at Cook Children's in Fort Worth. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We know that about 40% of kids under the age of five who get measles are gonna wind up in the hospital, and nobody wants that," Whitworth said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started in &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measels-outbreak-cases-texas-gaines-county-terry-county-latest-update/269-99d838f0-1c2a-4589-8d18-cc288ea696e7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Gaines County on February 5 &lt;/a&gt;with someone who tested positive for measles and traveled to Texas State University, the &lt;a href="/article/news/local/university-texas-san-antonio-utsa-roadrunners-email-community-gaines-county-visitor-infected-contagious-measles-exposure-main-campus-tour/273-658835f6-2323-434c-88c3-743e2e4b3f68" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;University of Texas San Antonio&lt;/a&gt;, the Riverwalk and a Buc-ees over Valentine’s Day and the following weekend. Since then, Dawson, Ector, Lubbock, Lynn, Terry and Yoakum Counties have also reported measles cases. The virus has also crossed over to New Mexico which is reporting 9 cases.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is measles?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control, measles is a highly contagious virus that can be serious. In its definition, the CDC notes, “Anyone who is not protected against measles is at risk,” adding that two doses of the MMR vaccine provide the best protection against measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rash with red, flat spots that begins on the face and spreads down to the rest of the body&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever, can spike to greater than 104&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How does it spread?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles spreads through infectious droplets and the air when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/vaccine-preventable-diseases/vaccine-preventable-disease-conditions/measles-rubeola" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/a&gt;. It’s important to note that the measles virus can remain infectious in the air up to two hours after an infected person leaves.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles don’t show up until a week, sometimes two weeks, after exposure. The challenge is that those infected are contagious about four days before any outward signs of the virus appear.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Carla Garcia Carreno, Director for Infection Prevention and Control at Children’s Medical Center Plano, shared, “The incubation period is about 8 to 14 days, but it can range from 7 to 21 days."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She adds, “You can have been exposed and infected with the measles and not have symptoms for up to 21 days and usually the person that contracts measles is contagious from 4 days before the onset of the rash until 4 days after the onset of the rash. So for those 8 days. However, the tricky thing here is that before you develop a rash, you can have symptoms that are very non-specific, like influenza-like. with cough, fever, congestion, and conjunctivitis. So you may think you have the flu and, it's measles and you may be spreading to all the vulnerable people without knowing that you have the measles.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What if I suspect I’ve been exposed to measles?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services provides guidance for those who believe they have been exposed to measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay home from work, school and other group settings until after the fourth day of the rash onset&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Isolate, especially if you are unvaccinated against measles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Call your doctor before you show up to get tested, so they can prepare&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unvaccinated kids shall be excluded from schools and childcare settings for at least 21 days from exposure to a measles case, according to the Texas Administrative Code&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get more information on how long kids will be out of school and when they can return to Texas &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/idps-home/school-communicable-disease-chart" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;online here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitworth said a vaccinated person "should be fine" if they were on the college campuses or inside the restaurants or Buc-ees while the measles patients was there.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she suggests an unvaccinated or immunocompromised person contact their doctor for guidance..&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If fever, a runny nose, pink eye, or a rash develops within that 21-period but the illness isn't too severe, Whitworth suggests calling a provider before going to a clinic or emergency room in order to keep from exposing a waiting room to the virus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are the risks of measles?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles can cause serious health complications, especially in children younger than 5 years of age. Common complications are ear infections and diarrhea. Serious complications include pneumonia and encephalitis, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s the age group where most hospitalizations and complications have been described. Again, this will be mostly on those less than 5 years of age that have not been vaccinated. So historically, because measles was a disease that we rarely see, most of the adult people are already immune for prior vaccination because of the fact that there was no circulation," Dr. Carreno said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospitalization and complications during pregnancy are also documented risks of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to young children, those most at risk also include pregnant women and those with weakened immune systems, such as from leukemia or HIV infection.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is the recommended vaccine schedule?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, measles was eradicated in 2000 and has been rarely reported since then. The agency stresses that the best protection is the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC recommends all children get two doses of the MMR, or measles-mumps-rubella, vaccine with the first dose at 12 to 15 months of age and the second dose at 4 to 6 years of age. Children can also get the second dose earlier, at least 28 days following the first dose.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For students at post-high school educational institutions without the vaccine, a two-dose MMR vaccine is recommended, separated by at least 28 days.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adults who do not have the vaccine, at least one dose of MMR vaccine is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitworth suggests families with babies who are too young to receive the vaccine take extra precautions.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Make sure the parents; vaccines are up to date, make sure the siblings' vaccines are up to date. If grandparents are keeping those kids, make sure the grandparents' vaccines are up to date," she said. "Avoid any contact with people who have cough, runny nose, red eyes, or a rash. Avoid all ill contacts."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitworth reminds families the vaccine has saved countless lives.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is one of the routine immunizations and remember that this is one of the most contagious diseases. If you were exposed, make sure that you isolate yourself and monitor because you may even be incubating and you can pass it on even if you don't have symptoms or if you have not developed the rash. So I think awareness and keeping ourselves informed with good sources is the key at this time," Dr. Carreno said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Dementia is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-isnt-the-only-form-of-dementia-an-expert-explains-the-differences"&gt;typically associated&lt;/a&gt; with severe loss of memory and cognitive function. It's often accompanied by a variety of other psychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety, sleep loss, and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="153035" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new population-based study led by researchers from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden has found a common first-line class of medications prescribed to dementia patients for depression could be hastening their cognitive decline, while also putting individuals at greater risk of fractures and an earlier death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though other factors can't be conclusively ruled out, the possibility that some antidepressants might worsen an underlying condition may be important for medical specialists treating dementia patients to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/ssris/art-20044825"&gt;Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; (SSRIs) and &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/antidepressants/art-20044970"&gt;serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; (SNRIs) are considered the first choice in antidepressants thanks to having relatively few side effects. Yet &lt;a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3266805/v1"&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; has identified an association between the inhibitors and an increased risk of dementia in older adults, compared with psychotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unsurprising that &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.13807"&gt;some classes&lt;/a&gt; of antidepressants risk interfering with processes responsible for our ability to think and recall our past. However, SSRIs have been considered &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-antidepressants-may-have-another-surprising-effect-on-your-brain"&gt;to be largely helpful&lt;/a&gt; in protecting brains from neurodegeneration, even linked to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1107411108"&gt;reducing plaques&lt;/a&gt; thought to play a role in damaging brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reconciling these seemingly contradictory findings in the population has itself failed to reveal a definitive answer, potentially because of the type of data collected and limitations in the way results were gathered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their comprehensive analysis, Karolinska Institute neurobiologist Minjia Mo and colleagues used a nationwide Swedish register of medical data collected from newly diagnosed dementia patients between 2007 and 2018. A total of 18,740 patients were included, with just over 20 percent being recently prescribed at least one antidepressant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of those individual drug prescriptions, just under two-thirds were some form of SSRI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found a clear relationship between that medication and severe dementia, with anything more than a standard daily dose predicting an increase of nearly half a point in dementia assessment scores per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153044" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153044" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/graph_mmse_dementia_score.jpg" alt="graph of cognitive decline and ssris" class="wp-image-153044 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/graph_mmse_dementia_score.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/graph_mmse_dementia_score-612x415.jpg 612w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/graph_mmse_dementia_score-600x407.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153044" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mini–mental state examination scores taken over three years, comparing antidepressant use with non-use in dementia patients. (Mo et al., &lt;em&gt;BMC Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the observational nature of the study and its inherent limitations, it's plausible that other factors could be influencing the relationship, making it difficult to draw a clear line between the antidepressant dose and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact patients are already experiencing cognitive decline makes the outcome especially challenging to analyze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However the researchers also found a concerning rise in the risk of fractures that could be associated with higher SSRI doses, which may indicate unwanted neurological interference too, as do their results hinting at an increase in all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study failed to find any such link with SNRIs, suggesting differences in their mechanisms or possibly a limitation in the study itself. Future research could provide clarity on the risks and benefits of each class of antidepressant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note changes to medication must only be undertaken in consultation with a doctor. Physicians and specialists in dementia care take a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antidepressants-could-trigger-some-cases-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome"&gt;variety of risks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antidepressants-are-linked-with-less-risk-of-dying-from-covid-19-study-finds"&gt;potential benefits&lt;/a&gt; into account when prescribing individual patients with a treatment plan and when modifying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tailoring combinations of medication and dosages means considering their overall prognosis, making studies like these essential in striking the right balance in easing the anguish that comes with cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-025-03851-3"&gt;BMC Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dozens of NIH study sections — meetings in which panels of expert scientists consider which research projects the agency should support — have been canceled in recent weeks, after the Trump administration barred the NIH from posting any new notices to the Federal Register as part of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/22/trump-administration-orders-health-communications-pause-cdc-hhs-fda/"&gt;a freeze on communications &lt;/a&gt;across health agencies. By law, notices of study section meetings must appear in the Federal Register at least 15 days in advance of assembly. No notice, no meeting. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Monday, NIH employees within the Office of the Director were told that Federal Register notices for study sections run by the agency’s Center for Scientific Review — which reviews most major academic research grants, fellowships, and small business grants — will start being permitted again, according to an email reviewed by STAT. However, it appears that notices of meetings of advisory councils, which provide additional review and make final funding recommendations, will not. &lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON — The findings of a new Texas health report say a 250-square mile area of east Harris County is a cancer cluster. Some residents believe it may be linked to decades-old hazardous waste pits in the San Jacinto River.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The residents hope the report will motivate the EPA to force the landowners to clean the site up.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene Hennigan, who has have lived in the Highlands along the San Jacinto River for decades, has experienced great loss. He says it’s due to the waste pits’ impact on the nearby environment.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My son Jeff, who played and swam in these waters...he fished as a kid and has died from two types of lung cancer,” Hennigan said. His wife also got breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worry from parents like Hennigan and other residents in the area prompted a request to the Texas Department of State Health Services to study cancer cases around the area.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/CHI-ESTB/DSHS%2520East%2520Harris%2520County%2520Cancer%2520Assessment%2520-%2520Summary%2520Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;In a summary—the report says leukemia, lung and bronchus, and lymphoma cancers&lt;/a&gt; were statistically significantly greater than expected. Although, the study says it was not intending to look for causes of the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While the findings are not surprising to those living in the shadow of contamination they are a sad vindication for what far too many of us have experienced," Jackie Medcalf with the Texas Health and Environment Alliance said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now the community knows this information does it help with early detection, what is it that can be possibly done to help the communities here?” &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medcalf, whose group requested the study—is hoping to meet with the EPA to hurry the cleanup process at the waste pit sites.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The pressure point right now is to tell the EPA to tell the irresponsible parties to get out here and clean it up,” Harris County Precinct 3 commissioner Tom Ramsey is hoping the state and the EPA will step in. Residents like Hennigan are hoping for progress to be made.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Develop a schedule for completion with milestones, have penalties for not meeting those milestones, and watch them get this done before we lose another hundred lives,” Hennigan said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group who requested the study plans to seek further refined data about cancer cases in this area.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KHOU 11 has reached out to the EPA for comment about the findings and we are waiting for a response.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tgnaNewNode"&gt;What is the San Jacinto River Waste Pits Superfund Site?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The San Jacinto River Waste Pits Superfund site, located in Harris County, Texas (Figure 1), consists of two sets of impoundments, or pits, built in the mid-1960s for disposing solid and liquid pulp and paper mill wastes that are contaminated with dioxins and furans. The northern set of impoundments, about 14 acres in size, are located on the western bank of the San Jacinto River, north of the Interstate 10 (I-10) bridge over the San Jacinto River.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report released Monday does not link the cause of the cancer cluster to the superfund site.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Benefits and a non-existent risk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using an adjusted odds ratio, the researchers found that vaccination reduced the likelihood of developing long COVID with one or more symptoms by 57 percent, and reduced the likelihood of developing long COVID with two or more symptoms by 73 percent. Vaccination prior to infection was also linked to a 75 percent reduction in risk of developing long COVID that impacted day-to-day functioning. The authors note that the estimates of protection are likely underestimates because the calculations do not account for the fact that vaccination prevented some children from getting infected in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that children should stay up to date with current COVID-19 vaccination recommendations as vaccination not only protects against severe COVID-19 illness but also protects against [long Covid]," the authors conclude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a second short report in JAMA Network Open, researchers helped dispel concern that the vaccines could cause sudden cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death in young athletes. This is an unproven claim that was fueled by anti-vaccine advocates amid the pandemic, including the new US Health Secretary and long-time &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-kennedy-election-vaccines-2ccde2df146f57b5e8c26e8494f0a16a"&gt;anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7314a5.htm"&gt;previous analyses&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.063753"&gt;failed to find a link&lt;/a&gt; between COVID-19 vaccines and sudden cardiac deaths, the new study took a broader approach. The study, led by researchers at the University of Washington, looked at whether the number of sudden cardiac arrests (SCA) and sudden cardiac deaths (SCD) among young athletes changed at all during the pandemic (2020–2022) compared with prior years (2017–2019). The researchers drew records from the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research. They also collected medical records and autopsy reports on cases among competitive athletes from the youth, middle school, high school, club, college, or professional levels who experienced sudden cardiac arrest or death at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, there were 387 cases, with no statistically significant difference in the number of cases in the years prior to the pandemic (203) compared with those during the pandemic (184).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This cohort study found no increase in SCA/SCD in young competitive athletes in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that reports asserting otherwise were overestimating the cardiovascular risk of COVID-19 infection, vaccination, and myocarditis," the authors conclude.&lt;/p&gt;

Gaw adds that she loves to sprinkle mixed nuts on top of yogurt, salad or oatmeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Lentils&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you may just think of these tasty pulses as a variety of soup (delicious and filling, by the way!), lentils can also be used as a meat substitute in meatballs or Bolognese sauce, and are a nutritional powerhouse, says Gaw. &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/172421/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Half a cup of cooked lentils;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Half a cup of cooked lentils&lt;/a&gt; have 9 g protein and 8 g fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Beans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you prefer garbanzo beans, black beans or kidney beans, these are the perfect little package of fiber-plus-protein. “I love adding &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/food-recipes/cooking/g60215479/types-of-beans/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:different types of beans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;different types of beans&lt;/a&gt; to soups, salads, stews, pasta sauce, casseroles, dips or rice dishes to boost the protein and fiber content,” says Gaw. &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/175238/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Half a cup of cooked black beans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Half a cup of cooked black beans&lt;/a&gt; contains around 7 g protein and 8 g fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Brown rice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you're craving a base for stir fries, burritos or protein bowls, skip the white stuff and choose &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a41951427/brown-vs-white-rice/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brown rice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;brown rice&lt;/a&gt; instead, suggests Gaw: It's a whole grain that is higher in both protein and fiber than its refined cousin. &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/169704/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Half a cup of brown rice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Half a cup of brown rice&lt;/a&gt; has 2.75 g protein and just under 2 g fiber.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Chia seeds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;kajakiki - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decade ago, if you asked the average person about chia, they would probably only know them as &lt;a href="https://www.chia.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the source of hair on a gag gift;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the source of hair on a gag gift&lt;/a&gt;.

And for good reason: Not only are they tasty, but just &lt;a href="https://tools.myfooddata.com/nutrition-facts/100052928/wt1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:1 tablespoon of chia seeds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; 1 tablespoon of chia seeds&lt;/a&gt; has around and &lt;br&gt;1.7 g of protein and 3.4 g fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Quinoa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a nutty, chewy flavor that works equally well in soups, stews, salads and bowls, quinoa is an easy way for vegetarians and vegans to get a good dose of protein. “Quinoa is one of the few complete plant proteins, meaning it contains all of the essential protein building blocks that your body needs,” says Militano. “I love using quinoa as a foundation to a breakfast bowl with cinnamon, berries, peanut butter and a drizzle of maple syrup. &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/168917/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Just half a cup of quinoa;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Just half a cup of quinoa&lt;/a&gt; will give you 4 g of protein and 2.6 g fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Broccoli&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just beans and grains that double up on protein and fiber. With 2.6 g protein and 2.4 g fiber per &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170379/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cup of chopped broccoli;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cup of chopped broccoli&lt;/a&gt;, the ubiquitous green veggie is a great source of the two important nutrients. Militano suggests adding it to an omelette, which gives you an &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/food-recipes/healthy/g61490064/high-fiber-breakfast-recipes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:extra fiber boost with your breakfast;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;extra fiber boost with your breakfast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Edamame&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;thesomegirl - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who doesn't love popping a chewy soybean out of the pod and into your mouth — the protein-packed beans are as addictive as popcorn, and &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/168411/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a half cup of edamame;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a half cup of edamame&lt;/a&gt; has around 9.2 g protein and 4 g fiber. Roasted edamame is a perfect on-the-go snack that comes in a variety of flavors, says Militano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Oats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most comforting breakfast on a cold winter day is also a great choice for protein and fiber. “Oats are so versatile and are a wonderful source of fiber and plant-based protein. One of my favorite breakfasts is a savory oat bowl with eggs, cheese and veggies,” says Militano. &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/172989/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Half a cup of oats contains;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Half a cup of oats contains&lt;/a&gt; 5.5 g protein and 3.8 g fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Sweet potatoes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether baked, roasted or sliced into fries, sweet potatoes are known as one of the best ways to get vitamin A — but they can also help bump up your protein and fiber intake for the day. A &lt;a href="https://www.ces.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/NC-HOTM-Sweet-Potatoes-English.pdf?fwd=no" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:half cup of baked sweet potato;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;half cup of baked sweet potato&lt;/a&gt; has 2 g protein and 3 g fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is everywhere these days—the keto and paleo diet trends are still going strong, and you can fill your shopping cart with all kinds of unusual products, including chips made from chicken and protein-infused beer. And while we know protein is a crucial part of your diet, focusing solely on this macronutrient can put you at risk being low in another important nutrient/ If you are focusing on steak, chicken, and other animal-based proteins, you may be missing out on fiber. “Since animal foods don’t contain fiber, both fiber and protein can only be found in plant foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and legumes,” says Sheri Gaw, RDN, owner of &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/sheridietitian.com/__;!!Ivohdkk!h7Rt5E0BhGEg8hpG6qgAOUN0NSLFKsxPilNWX_ikalbzomkto063PUR_qU2w6dnm-dsEgbu8p9_McXtT93in$" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sheri the Plant Strong Dietitian;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sheri the Plant Strong Dietitian &lt;/a&gt;in the Bay Area.

You're forgetful.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-02/subtle-ways-body-warns-mental-health-slipping-forgetful.png" alt="Forgetful woman whose mental health is slipping" title="Subtle Ways Your Body Warns You Your Mental Health Is Slipping" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;MAYA LAB | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Punjab said that if "you can't remember what you said [or] did a few moments or days ago," that's a bad sign. Don't worry too much if you misplace your keys once or twice, but if you find yourself constantly forgetting things, it might be cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://livehealthy.muhealth.org/stories/becoming-forgetful-6-underlying-issues-may-be-causing-your-memory-loss" rel="nofollow"&gt;According to the University of Missouri Health Care&lt;/a&gt;, "mental health issues place extra strain on your brain." This can affect your focus, cognition, and memory over time. Stress and depression, specifically, &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/memory/memory-and-mental-health"&gt;increase forgetfulness&lt;/a&gt;, as does lack of sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/health-wellness/want-better-mental-health-time-accept-essential-truths"&gt;If You Want Better Mental Health, It's Time To Accept These 10 Essential Truths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. You stay in bed all day.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/entertainment/sleep-scientist-defends-bed-rotting-self-care"&gt;"bed rotting" has become somewhat of a trend&lt;/a&gt;, spending all day in bed with no motivation to get up is an indicator that you are heading down a not-so-great path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are struggling to get out of bed, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325712" rel="nofollow"&gt;Medical News Today recommends&lt;/a&gt; setting manageable goals such as taking a walk to the park or even just getting up to eat breakfast or use the bathroom. Being accountable to another person, or even a pet, may also help. They further suggest playing music, brightening up your room, and spending time outside. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="player-wrapper-outer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. You're more emotional than usual.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-02/subtle-ways-body-warns-mental-health-slipping-mood-swings.png" alt="Emotional woman whose mental health is slipping" title="Subtle Ways Your Body Warns You Your Mental Health Is Slipping" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Gladskikh Tatiana | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many mental health conditions, including anxiety, depression, and ADHD, can &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/mood-swings" rel="nofollow"&gt;cause mood swings&lt;/a&gt;. If you are over-emotional and struggling to control your thoughts and feelings, that is a sign that your mental health is slipping. Of course, there are many other causes of mood swings as well, such as hormone fluctuations, medications, and sleep deprivation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. You withdrawing from family and friends.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://psychcentral.com/lib/the-importance-of-connection"&gt;Spending time with loved ones&lt;/a&gt; is an important part of our lives — it provides a sense of belonging, reduces stress, boosts our mood, and potentially even leads to a longer lifespan. If you're declining invitations to family gatherings and not replying to text messages from friends, it might be wise to consider why you're isolating yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your family and friends care about you and pulling away will only do you, and your mental health, harm. When you're in a bad spot it may be tempting to stay away from everyone, but connecting with those you love is far more beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/signs-someone-not-taking-care-themself"&gt;10 Small Signs Someone's Not Taking Good Care Of Themselves, Backed By Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. You're losing interest in your hobbies.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobbies reduce stress and help to improve mental health and overall well-being. Some say they are &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/therapist-explains-two-reasons-hobbies-key-happier-life"&gt;the key to a happy life&lt;/a&gt;. If you start losing interest in hobbies you once felt passionate about, your mental health may be declining. Not caring about stuff that you used to is a clear indicator of something being wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. You spend hours scrolling on your phone.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-02/subtle-ways-body-warns-mental-health-slipping-doomscroll.png" alt="Woman whose mental health is slipping scrolling on her phone" title="Subtle Ways Your Body Warns You Your Mental Health Is Slipping" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Olezzo | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost everyone falls into the trap of doomscrolling now and again. &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/signs-self-inflicting-psychological-damage-news-consumption"&gt;In today's political climate&lt;/a&gt;, it's nearly impossible not to. Yet if you're consistently spending hours mindlessly consuming content, this may be an indicator of a larger problem. As tempting as it may be, distracting yourself from your problems doesn't make them go away — it usually makes them worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. You're snapping at loved ones.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're getting mad at your loved ones over minor inconveniences and things that aren't really their fault, chances are you are taking your mental health struggles out on them. Misdirected anger is a sign of poor emotional regulation, which often stems from stress, anxiety, depression, and other mental health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. You feel knots in your stomach.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If "you've lost your appetite or feel 'knots' in your stomach," Punjab said you may be experiencing mental health-related issues. &lt;a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/gastrointestinal-articles/stress-stomach-pain-when-to-see-a-doctor" rel="nofollow"&gt;According to the University of Chicago Medicine,&lt;/a&gt; "stress, worrying and anxiety are common causes of stomach discomfort and other gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms," including so-called "knots."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Research has shown there is a strong connection between our brain and our digestive tract through the central nervous system," they explained. "The part of the central nervous system that serves the GI tract, called the enteric nervous system, makes a direct connection between the brain and GI system. In stressful or anxiety-provoking situations, it can cause normal physiologic processes to be interpreted as painful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/health-wellness/want-better-mental-health-time-accept-essential-truths"&gt;If You Want Better Mental Health, It's Time To Accept These 10 Essential Truths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sahlah Syeda is a writer for YourTango who covers entertainment, news, and human interest topics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="field field--name-field-content-contains-affiliate field--type-boolean field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="rc-widget-c743d1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>YourTango</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 23:21:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPQ0ttbWRMN3RYVjd4MUFqWDRRWkJGaGs0R2c4a0tLREpkR2F2Zk9mbkY2bXIydVE3NjgyWjA4MTNFZU9Ga0YxSUlZRzFGeHlqbC1pLUZuWm9GbDZTaWVnVjZJcnQtV1dLcjlMWWxpcWFRYTgzNWRZclE4Wm5uQjJmZ3RR</guid></item><item><title>Poor Sleep Alters Immune Cells, Increasing Risk for Inflammatory Diseases - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE13TVNYUm1ZdS1VUEdCaGhkWU15RWp6YVh4TFowamlHTHFkN2NkLWRKbWdiREEyYXVRNmNvWEhHd0dVblZuVnRKRy1UMGRpdXNkOGI4SElCQjRzZGM4TkFSR3AwNUw0LWpDWnpZdGhybTY1cmpE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study reveals that even a single night of sleep deprivation can alter immune cell profiles to resemble those seen in obesity, a condition linked to chronic inflammation. Researchers found that sleep-deprived individuals had increased levels of non-classical monocytes, immune cells associated with inflammatory responses, similar to patterns observed in obese participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that poor sleep quality may rapidly trigger immune system changes, potentially contributing to long-term inflammatory diseases like obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Future research will explore whether interventions like structured sleep therapies can reverse these immune alterations and improve overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep and Immune Health:&lt;/strong&gt; A single night of sleep deprivation alters immune cells, mimicking inflammatory patterns seen in obesity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Inflammation:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep-deprived individuals showed higher levels of non-classical monocytes, which regulate inflammatory responses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chronic Disease Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Persistent sleep disruption may contribute to inflammation-driven conditions like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AAI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New research reveals insight into the impact sleep quality has on a person’s immune system, and how it could be linked to the development of diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Immunology,&lt;/em&gt; found that even a single night of 24-hour sleep deprivation in young, lean, and healthy individuals altered the profile of immune cells that help regulate the immune system to resemble that of individuals with obesity – a condition known to drive chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107936"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/sleep-deprivation-immune-health-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/sleep-deprivation-immune-health-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/sleep-deprivation-immune-health-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/sleep-deprivation-immune-health-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/sleep-deprivation-immune-health-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/sleep-deprivation-immune-health-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/sleep-deprivation-immune-health-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/sleep-deprivation-immune-health-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a man, immune cells and a bed." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/sleep-deprivation-immune-health-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/sleep-deprivation-immune-health-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/sleep-deprivation-immune-health-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/sleep-deprivation-immune-health-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/sleep-deprivation-immune-health-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/sleep-deprivation-immune-health-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/sleep-deprivation-immune-health-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Non-classical monocytes were also increased significantly in obese participants, correlating with reduced sleep quality and elevated pro-inflammatory markers. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that the immune system is highly sensitive to sleep and may adapt rapidly to changes in sleep pattern. According to the researchers, if these shifts persist, they could contribute to long-term inflammatory states and increase the risk of disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Substantial evidence exists linking sleep disorders and disturbances to an array of chronic conditions and morbidity, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. It’s also known that poor health outcomes can be driven by chronic inflammation but the direct influence of sleep on circulating immune cells, such as monocytes, is not as well understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monocytes are a vital component of the innate immune system – the body’s first line of defense that rapidly detects pathogens and kickstarts the immune response. There are three subsets of monocytes – classical, intermediate and non-classical monocytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-classical monocytes patrol the body, sense and respond to inflammatory cues, and help to maintain and regulate the immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers from the Dasman Diabetes Institute, Kuwait City, Kuwait, analyzed the sleep patterns of 237 healthy adult participants of varying BMI, and took blood samples to profile the levels of different monocytes as well as markers of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that obese individuals had significantly lower sleep quality and higher chronic low-grade inflammation compared to the lean group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-classical monocytes were also increased significantly in obese participants, correlating with reduced sleep quality and elevated pro-inflammatory markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five, healthy lean individuals also took part in a 24-hour sleep deprivation part of the study and had blood samples collected throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that sleep deprivation altered the profile of monocytes like what was seen in obese participants, supporting the role of sleep health in modulating inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Fatema Al-Rashed, who led the study, said: “Our findings underscore a growing public health challenge. Advancements in technology, prolonged screen time, and shifting societal norms are increasingly disruptive to regular sleeping hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This disruption in sleep has profound implications for immune health and overall well-being.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers next want to explore in greater detail the mechanisms linking sleep deprivation to immune changes. They also want to find out if interventions such as structured sleep therapies or technology-use guidelines can reverse these immune alterations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the long term, we aim for this research to drive policies and strategies that recognize the critical role of sleep in public health. We envision workplace reforms and educational campaigns promoting better sleep practices, particularly for populations at risk of sleep disruption due to technological and occupational demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ultimately, this could help mitigate the burden of inflammatory diseases like obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases,” said Dr Al-Rashed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and inflammation research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#79141518143918181057160b1e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Matt Lam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aai.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AAI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Matt Lam – AAI&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jimmun/vkae016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Impact of sleep deprivation on monocyte subclasses and function&lt;/a&gt;” by Fatema Al-Rashed et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Immunology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact of sleep deprivation on monocyte subclasses and function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relationship between sleep deprivation, obesity, and systemic inflammation is a critical area of investigation due to its significant impact on health. While it is established that poor sleep adversely affects obesity and metabolic syndromes, the specific mechanisms, particularly subclinical inflammation independent of obesity, remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study investigates how sleep quality influences monocyte subclass distribution and its association with systemic inflammation across a spectrum of body mass index categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our cohort study, 237 healthy participants were categorized by body mass index. Participants’ dietary intake, physical activity, and sleep patterns were objectively tracked through wearable ActiGraph GT3X accelerometer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data showed that obese individuals had significantly lower sleep quality and higher chronic low-grade inflammation. Nonclassical monocytes increased significantly in obesity, correlating with reduced sleep quality and elevated proinflammatory cytokines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although body mass index emerged as a significant factor in driving inflammation, mediation analyses further defined that sleep disruption independently contributes to inflammation, regardless of obesity status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Controlled sleep deprivation experiments confirmed these findings, demonstrating reversible increases in nonclassical monocytes expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study highlights the importance of sleep quality in regulating immune responses and inflammation in obesity, suggesting that improving sleep quality could reduce inflammation and improve health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 23:18:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE13TVNYUm1ZdS1VUEdCaGhkWU15RWp6YVh4TFowamlHTHFkN2NkLWRKbWdiREEyYXVRNmNvWEhHd0dVblZuVnRKRy1UMGRpdXNkOGI4SElCQjRzZGM4TkFSR3AwNUw0LWpDWnpZdGhybTY1cmpE</guid></item><item><title>AI Model Predicts Brain Aging Speed to Detect Cognitive Decline Early - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTFBfMVd2VURUUUVtSFh5d1pZbld4Wms0SV84bGJlR1EzbGFaS2NhLVRqM2pGaWFJVlBNLVFDY3o3Z2x6WUF3aXlRRS1tSkItMGo1NEFpQ0ZZc0VycWdHNm9aMXpNWEdOX1duSTQwVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new AI model can measure how fast a person’s brain is aging using MRI scans, providing a powerful tool for detecting cognitive decline. Unlike previous methods, this model tracks brain aging over time, identifying regions most affected and correlating changes with cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that faster brain aging strongly links to cognitive impairment, suggesting early intervention could help prevent neurodegenerative diseases. This breakthrough could lead to better diagnostics, personalized treatments, and earlier identification of Alzheimer’s risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracking Brain Aging:&lt;/strong&gt; The AI model analyzes MRI scans over time to measure how fast the brain ages, offering a more precise method than previous approaches.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Decline Predictor:&lt;/strong&gt; Faster brain aging correlates with reduced cognitive function, including slower processing speed and memory decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential for Early Diagnosis:&lt;/strong&gt; The model may help identify individuals at high risk for Alzheimer’s before symptoms appear, enabling earlier interventions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;USC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new artificial intelligence model measures how fast a patient’s brain is aging and could be a powerful new tool for understanding, preventing and treating cognitive decline and dementia, according to USC researchers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first-of-its-kind tool can non-invasively track the pace of brain changes by analyzing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107929"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ai-brain-aging-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ai-brain-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ai-brain-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ai-brain-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ai-brain-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ai-brain-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ai-brain-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ai-brain-aging-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ai-brain-aging-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ai-brain-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ai-brain-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ai-brain-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ai-brain-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ai-brain-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ai-brain-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Biological age is distinct from an individual’s chronological age, Irimia said. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faster brain aging closely correlates with a higher risk of cognitive impairment, said Andrei Irimia, associate professor of gerontology, biomedical engineering, quantitative &amp;amp; computational biology and neuroscience at the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology and visiting associate professor of psychological medicine at King’s College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a novel measurement that could change the way we track brain health both in the research lab and in the clinic,” he said. “Knowing how fast one’s brain is aging can be powerful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Irimia is the senior author of the study that describes the new model and its predictive power; the study was published February 24, 2025 in &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological brain age versus chronological age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biological age is distinct from an individual’s chronological age, Irimia said. Two people who are the same age based on their birthdate can have very different biological ages due to how well their body is functioning and how “old” the body’s tissues appear to be at a cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some common measures of biological age use blood samples to measure epigenetic aging and DNA methylation, which influences the roles of genes in the cell. However, measuring biological age from blood samples is a poor strategy for measuring the brain’s age, Irimia explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The barrier between the brain and the bloodstream prevents blood cells from crossing into the brain, such that a blood sample from one’s arm does not directly reflect methylation and other aging-related processes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, taking a sample directly from a patient’s brain is a much more invasive procedure, making it unfeasible to measure DNA methylation and other aspects of brain aging directly from living human brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research by Irimia and colleagues highlighted the potential of MRI scans to non-invasively measure the biological age of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earlier model used AI analysis to compare a patient’s brain anatomy to data compiled from the MRI scans of thousands of people of various ages and cognitive health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the cross-sectional nature of analyzing one MRI scan to estimate brain age had major limitations, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the previous model could, for instance, tell if a patient’s brain was ten years “older” than their calendar age, it couldn’t provide info on whether that additional aging occurred earlier or later in their life, nor could it indicate whether brain aging was speeding up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A more accurate picture of brain aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A newly developed three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) offers a more precise way to measure how the brain ages over time. Created in collaboration with Paul Bogdan, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering and holder of the Jack Munushian Early Career Chair at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, the model was trained and validated on more than 3,000 MRI scans of cognitively normal adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional cross-sectional approaches, which estimate brain age from one scan at a single time point, this longitudinal method compares baseline and follow-up MRI scans from the same individual. As a result, it more accurately pinpoints neuroanatomic changes tied to accelerated or decelerated aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3D-CNN also generates interpretable “saliency maps,” which indicate the specific brain regions that are most important for determining the pace of aging, Bogdan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When applied to a group of 104 cognitively healthy adults and 140 Alzheimer’s disease patients, the new model’s calculations of brain aging speed closely correlated with changes in cognitive function tests given at both time points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The alignment of these measures with cognitive test results indicates that the framework may serve as an early biomarker of neurocognitive decline,” Bogdan said. “Moreover, it demonstrates its applicability in both cognitively normal individuals and those with cognitive impairment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that the model has the potential to better characterize both healthy aging and disease trajectories, and its predictive power could one day be applied to assessing which treatments would be more effective based on individual characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rates of brain aging are correlated significantly with changes in cognitive function,” Irimia said. “So, if you have a high rate of brain aging, you’re more likely to have a high rate of degradation in cognitive function, including memory, executive speed, executive function, and processing speed. It’s not only an anatomic measure; the changes we see in the anatomy are associated with changes we see in the cognition of these individuals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, Irimia and coauthors also note how the new model was able to distinguish different rates of aging across various regions of the brain. Delving into these differences –including how they vary based on genetics, environment, and lifestyle factors – could provide insight into how different pathologies develop in the brain, Irimia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also demonstrated that the pace of brain aging in certain regions differed between the sexes, which might shed light onto why men and women face different risks for neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Irimia said he is also excited about the potential for the new model to identify people with faster-than-normal brain aging before they show any symptoms of cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While new drugs targeting Alzheimer’s have been introduced, their efficacy has been less than researchers and doctors have hoped for, potentially because patients might not be starting the drug until there is already a great deal of Alzheimer’s pathology present in the brain, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One thing that my lab is very interested in is estimating risk for Alzheimer’s; we’d like to one day be able to say, ‘Right now, it looks like this person has a 30% risk for Alzheimer’s.’ We’re not there yet, but we’re working on it,” Irimia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think this kind of measure will be very helpful to produce variables that are prognostic and can help to forecast Alzheimer’s risk. That would be really powerful, especially as we start developing potential drugs for prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with Irimia and Bogdan, the study’s authors included first author Chenzhong Yin and Heng Ping of the USC Viterbi School of Engineering and Phoebe E.

BA, however, is a cross-sectional measure that summarizes cumulative neuroanatomic aging since birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, it conveys poorly recent or contemporaneous aging trends, which can be better quantified by the (temporal) pace &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; of brain aging. Many approaches to map &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;, however, rely on quantifying DNA methylation in whole-blood cells, which the blood–brain barrier separates from neural brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We introduce a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) to estimate &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; noninvasively from longitudinal MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our longitudinal model (LM) is trained on MRIs from 2,055 CN adults, validated in 1,304 CN adults, and further applied to an independent cohort of 104 CN adults and 140 patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In its test set, the LM computes &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.16 y (7% mean error).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This significantly outperforms the most accurate cross-sectional model, whose MAE of 1.85 y has 83% error. By synergizing the LM with an interpretable CNN saliency approach, we map anatomic variations in regional brain aging rates that differ according to sex, decade of life, and neurocognitive status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LM estimates of &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; are significantly associated with changes in cognitive functioning across domains. This underscores the LM’s ability to estimate &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; in a way that captures the relationship between neuroanatomic and neurocognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research complements existing strategies for AD risk assessment that estimate individuals’ rates of adverse cognitive change with age.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTFBfMVd2VURUUUVtSFh5d1pZbld4Wms0SV84bGJlR1EzbGFaS2NhLVRqM2pGaWFJVlBNLVFDY3o3Z2x6WUF3aXlRRS1tSkItMGo1NEFpQ0ZZc0VycWdHNm9aMXpNWEdOX1duSTQwVQ</guid></item><item><title>Doctor reveals disgusting risks of eating sushi as Hawaii tourist catches BRAIN WORMS - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors are warning about the potential health risks tied to eating sushi, coming on the heels of a parasitic brain infection diagnosed in a tourist in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hawaii/index.html" id="mol-db8101c0-f2fc-11ef-9ac4-4583c7517b33"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If not flash-frozen properly, raw fish can be a source of bacteria and parasites that cause food poisoning-like effects – severe nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, the chance of getting sick from eating sushi in US restaurants is low, thanks to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/fda/index.html" id="mol-db79d5d0-f2fc-11ef-9ac4-4583c7517b33"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; regulations that require fish intended to be consumed raw or undercooked to be frozen first to kill parasites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, parasitic infections from consuming raw fish are more common outside the US due to differences in food safety and cultural practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The tourist diagnosed with a parasitic infection caused by the rat lungworm traveled from New England to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/thailand/index.html" id="mol-db82d680-f2fc-11ef-9ac4-4583c7517b33"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/japan/index.html" id="mol-db814fe0-f2fc-11ef-9ac4-4583c7517b33"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, and Hawaii. It’s not clear whether she was sickened after eating raw fish, snails, or produce, all of which can harbor the parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Parasites are not the only concern when it comes to ordering sushi, particularly when outside of the US. Raw or undercooked fish can also harbor listeria, vibrio, or &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-6930609/U-S-health-officials-probe-multi-state-Salmonella-outbreak.html"&gt;salmonella&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Fish naturally carry parasites, but freezing kills them. If sushi-grade fish isn't frozen properly, handled unsafely, or thawed incorrectly, parasites may still be present&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s not clear how many Americans get sick from eating sushi every year. Many don’t seek medical care because the issue generally resolves on its own. But overall, 48 million Americans get food poisoning every year, and of those, 128,000 are hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Brian Labus, an epidemiologist at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nevada/index.html" id="mol-eade58f0-f2fe-11ef-9ac4-4583c7517b33"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/las-vegas/index.html" id="mol-eadde3c0-f2fe-11ef-9ac4-4583c7517b33"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;, told DailyMail.com: ‘We're really talking about just rare occurrences. But no food preparation is perfectly foolproof. Things can always go wrong.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many fish &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14097627/seattle-restaurant-closed-food-critic-keith-lee-worm-fob-sushi.html"&gt;naturally harbor parasites&lt;/a&gt; that are killed when frozen. However, if sushi-grade fish is not frozen at -4 degrees for 7 days or -31 degrees for 15 hours, if it is prepared in unsanitary conditions, or if it is thawed improperly, parasites can find their way in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rat lungworms are more commonly found in slugs and snails and on the produce they come in contact with than on raw fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anisakis worms are commonly found on fish and can cause anisakiasis. The worms can invade the stomach wall or intestines and cause severe gastrointestinal pain, nausea, and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some people suffer digestive bleeding, bowel obstruction, and inflammation in the inner wall of the abdomen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Japan, where sushi is king, sees about 3,000 cases of anisakiasis annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Labus said: ‘You’re going to find it in places where some of the fish is easier to get. Different kinds of fish have different types; it really depends on which kind of fish you eat and where it comes from. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, if you're far from the ocean, you probably don't have the same fish options as if you're on an island that has access to fresh seafood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wild salmon from the Pacific Ocean is more likely to carry anisakis or tapeworms compared to farmed salmon, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in landlocked areas such as the Midwest U.S. or Central Europe, fish options are often limited to frozen or shipped seafood. While this might seem less ‘fresh,’ the extra layer of freezing actually reduces the risk of parasites, making it safer for raw consumption in dishes like sushi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sushi fish isn’t just served as-is—it’s deep frozen after being caught, which kills parasites. This process makes sushi safe to eat, and if it weren’t, it wouldn’t be legally sold&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Labus added: ‘The thing to keep in mind with with the raw fish that we use in sushi, is it's not like we do nothing to it. When we catch fish, we super deep freeze it, and that kills parasites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘So even though you're eating uncooked fish, that deep freezing kills the parasites in it, and that's why sushi is safe. If it were an unsafe food item, no place would be allowed to prepare it and sell it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The woman hospitalized in Hawaii developed a rare type of meningitis - inflammation of the protective layers around the brain and spinal cord - after returning from a three-week trip to Thailand, Japan, and Hawaii. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At first, doctors thought she had a nerve disorder, but her exam ruled it out. Other possible causes, like a reaction to medication, were also dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As her symptoms worsened, tests showed she had a parasitic infection likely caused by eating food contaminated with snail or slug slime. After six days in the hospital, she recovered and was sent home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's not clear how exactly she contracted the worms, but she predominantly dined on street foods and sushi while abroad.  &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Listeriosis caused by listeria can also occur, especially if the fish is processed or stored in unsanitary conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Vibrio bacteria can naturally contaminate seafood, particularly shellfish. While the Vibrio parahaemolyticus bacteria causes gastrointestinal illness, Vibrio vulnificus can cause bloodstream infections, skin infections, swelling, and septic shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While most Vibrio infections are mild, some species (like Vibrio vulnificus) can cause severe, life-threatening infections, especially in people with weakened immune systems, liver disease, or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research suggests that parasitic worms are becoming more common. A 2020 study found that the number of Anisakis worms in raw or undercooked seafood has increased over 280 times in the past 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rise in Anisakis parasites may signal a healthier marine ecosystem, but it also threatens vulnerable species, as marine mammals spread the parasite through their feces. Experts stressed the importance of public health awareness, as freezing or cooking seafood prevents human infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 22:44:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>New Test Detects Early Pancreatic Cancer with 85% Accuracy — and Researchers Say It Costs ‘Less Than a Penny’ - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE16dWpHSko1alJaSlJrRFZWd29MY3dBRlVLYWJVQW0zNHQ4dVJLT2gwWTA0WWhlb1VudHl1VE1RczA1OWhib05uQVA1cV9QTVE5M3NxaG1BaG9wRmxsYWQ4R1A1UHZiQlBKeGNpQndPN2JKalM3VzhtVVhyWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image of blood samples in a lab setting.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have developed an inexpensive blood test that they say can detect &lt;a href="https://people.com/fda-approves-new-treatment-metastatic-pancreatic-cancer-8580431" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pancreatic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pancreatic&lt;/a&gt; cancer — even in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a small blood sample, researchers from Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University say they can detect changes in the enzyme that breaks down protein, protease. “Production of proteases is a hallmark of cancer progression and circulating protease activity may inform diagnosis of certain cancers,” researchers wrote in the journal, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adq3110" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Science Translational Medicine.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test is called PAC-MANN — an abbreviation for  “protease activity-based assay using a magnetic nanosensor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Maps&lt;/p&gt; Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University Knight Cancer Institute’s Cancer Early Detection Advanced Research Center (CEDAR)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people.com/star-trek-actress-kitty-swink-pancreatic-cancer-survival-exclusive-8630002" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Star Trek Actress Kitty Swink Had a 4% Survival Rate After Pancreatic Cancer — It's Been 20 Years (Exclusive);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek &lt;/em&gt;Actress Kitty Swink Had a 4% Survival Rate After Pancreatic Cancer — It's Been 20 Years (Exclusive)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The problem with &lt;a href="https://people.com/pacreatic-cancer-thought-it-was-anxiety-attack-before-finals-exclusive-11678522" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pancreatic cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt; is that we often catch it too late. Our goal with PAC-MANN is to give clinicians a tool that can detect the disease much earlier, when more treatment options are available and there is a better chance of survival,” Dr. Jared Fischer, a scientist with the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute’s Cancer Early Detection Advanced Research Center (CEDAR) said in a &lt;a href="https://news.ohsu.edu/2025/02/12/new-blood-test-identifies-hard-to-detect-pancreatic-cancer-with-85-accuracy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;release&lt;/a&gt; on the breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pancreatic cancer is one of the most &lt;a href="https://people.com/golden-bachelorette-joan-vassos-pancreatic-cancer-pancan-purple-stride-exclusive-11679304" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:devastating cancers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;devastating cancers&lt;/a&gt; because it usually doesn’t exhibit symptoms until it’s too far advanced for effective treatment. As &lt;a href="https://pancan.org/facing-pancreatic-cancer/about-pancreatic-cancer/survival-rate/#bystage%" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pancreatic Cancer Action Network;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Pancreatic Cancer Action Network&lt;/a&gt; explains, even when it’s discovered only in the pancreas, the five-year survival rate is 44%. For all types of pancreatic cancer, including if it has spread, the five-year survival rate is 13%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PAC-MANN test was able to differentiate — 98% of the time — between the blood of someone with pancreatic cancer and the blood of someone who doesn’t have the disease. When used alongside the existing CA 19-9 test, it was able to diagnose early-stage pancreatic cancer with 85% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image of a person getting blood drawn.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people.com/maria-menounos-felt-like-explode-inside-due-to-pancreatic-cancer-8385611" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Maria Menounos Felt Like She Was Going to 'Explode Inside' Due to 'Severe' Pain from Pancreatic Cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Maria Menounos Felt Like She Was Going to 'Explode Inside' Due to 'Severe' Pain from Pancreatic Cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers pointed out that the test only uses a small amount of blood and takes under an hour, which keeps costs down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The big difference with this test is the cost: It takes only 8 microliters of blood and 45 minutes to run the test at a cost of less than a penny per sample,” lead author Dr. Jose L. Montoya Mira, a research engineer at OHSU’s CEDAR. said. “This could easily be used in rural and underserved settings, where traditional tests are not or cannot be used.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that the test ”could be used for people at high risk of pancreatic cancer, which is not targeted by current tests” — helping detect it, and treat it, sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Fischer said, “Hopefully this is one step toward ending cancer as we know it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/pancreatic-cancer-new-blood-test-early-detection-11685406" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 22:38:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE16dWpHSko1alJaSlJrRFZWd29MY3dBRlVLYWJVQW0zNHQ4dVJLT2gwWTA0WWhlb1VudHl1VE1RczA1OWhib05uQVA1cV9QTVE5M3NxaG1BaG9wRmxsYWQ4R1A1UHZiQlBKeGNpQndPN2JKalM3VzhtVVhyWQ</guid></item><item><title>Mendy Pellin: Having an Illness Isn’t an Embarrassment - COLlive</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE9DMk1tMnlWREJSYndVXzNuOXRkcGJKaDJpMVNwbThQOW11QTU1QllabVN6a1BMS3NxNkdicUQwVmZGNzJqQzRlVkRiTGZQdHFBbHRnd1owTGRzaHFIOFlieHBNWjBZdTRTZ25RcVZjV2dLZkdCTGpzVnI1aWxQUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post_text"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hi, I’m &lt;strong&gt;Mendy Pellin &lt;/strong&gt;and I have Ulcerative Colitis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made that declaration on social media a few years ago, right after moving from Los Angeles to New York. I had forgotten about the culture of secrecy and stigma and I wanted to help others not feel alone in the bathroom. OK, that sounds a bit funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I’ve “come out of the bathroom” I’ve been able to support scores of people in our community, that felt safe to reach out, after being diagnosed with IBD or not having luck with various treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say that humor is often a response to trauma. So where does bathroom humor come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A question that can probably be answered by anyone afflicted with Crohn’s or Ulcerative Colitis. Humor can definitely dial down the shame associated with the many awkward situations we find ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that can dial down the shame is meeting with others in the same boat as you – or at least in the next stall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shame only feeds anxiety that attributes to that disruptive flare-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, equipping yourself with the latest information can dial down anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are the ingredients that make up our event this Tuesday evening:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Meet your neighbors that are also struggling in silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Hear about the latest medical treatments from Dr. Hudesman, a global authority on IBD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Hear from Dr. Keefer, a global leader on research and education focusing on the mind-gut connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Hear from our beloved doctor, Dr. Eli Rosen, who understands our community’s health issues more than anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s some seriously valuable information – all sprinkled with a dash of humor, as your evening’s host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is not just for those with IBD. It’s also for friends, parents and family of those with IBD to get a better understanding how to support your loved one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made sure all restrooms are nearby, fully stocked and in working order, so you can avoid another “humorous” story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday, February 25, at 8:30 PM at Lubavitcher Yeshiva, 570 Crown Street.&lt;br&gt;

The borough spent about $6,000 on removing the dead waterfowl, the lowest cost from all of the entities borough officials contacted, Mayor Thomas Fritts previously said. About 50 animal control-type businesses were contacted, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XYIFDEVJBFE4XD7U6MOLNNGJZQ"&gt;Since the removal, at least three more dead birds were found and collected, Roth said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UCHLXUHQPZGEDBPR3FNJNNPH2I"&gt;Meanwhile, the borough asked the local Lions Foundation to relocate its popular Easter egg hunt, an annual event scheduled this year for April 12.

                    &lt;p&gt;Many patients with incurable cancer aren’t getting care that could ease their suffering at the end of life, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Close to half of patients with advanced cancer received aggressive cancer treatment within six months of their death, researchers found — treatment that came at the expense of palliative and hospice care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a quarter of patients received any &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/cancer/a-beginners-guide-to-understanding-cancer-pain-treatments"&gt;palliative&lt;/a&gt; care. When such care did come, it usually was provided in the month they died, results show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Even though clinicians and professional healthcare organizations have recommended early integration of supportive and palliative care for all patients with advanced cancers, it remains underused,” senior researcher &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/research/acs-researchers/robin-yabroff.html"&gt;Robin Yabroff&lt;/a&gt;, scientific vice president of health services research at the American Cancer Society, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“High-quality patient-centered end-of-life care is especially important for maximizing remaining quality of life for this population, yet uptake of advanced care planning and palliative care was low and late hospice enrollment was common,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers compared cancer surveillance data with data from Medicare to build a picture of end-of-life care in the U.S. for cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study included nearly 34,000 Medicare patients 66 or older diagnosed with advanced breast, prostate, pancreatic or lung cancers who died between 2014 and 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, about a quarter of patients received palliative care during that period. The annual percentage steadily rose from 21% in 2014 to 35% in 2019, results show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, 45% of advanced cancer patients received aggressive cancer care, typically driven by visits to intensive care units, researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lung cancer patients were most likely to receive aggressive care (47%), followed by breast and pancreatic cancer patients (41%) and prostate cancer patients (38%), results show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the results also showed more people turning to palliative care and advanced care planning during the final six months of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This research highlights the need for interventions to improve quality of care for patients with advanced cancers, especially those helping to remove barriers to better access palliative care,” Yabroff said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It also suggests the importance of clear, proactive communication between providers and patients and their families regarding advanced care planning to better guide end-of-life care efforts,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cutting-edge targeted therapies and immunotherapies for cancer could be tempting patients and families to opt for aggressive treatment, researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These therapies may inculcate a belief that a metastatic cancer may be curable, leading to potentially aggressive care despite patient preferences for initiating end-of-life care,” researchers wrote in the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed the highest rate of potentially aggressive care among patients with metastatic lung cancer, the disease area experiencing a disproportionate increase in the number of newly available innovative treatments during the study period,” the research team concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new study was published Feb. 21 in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2830176"&gt;JAMA Health Forum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good news for tea lovers: That daily brew might be purifying the water, too.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;In a new study, Northwestern University researchers demonstrated that brewing tea naturally adsorbs heavy metals like lead and cadmium, effectively filtering dangerous contaminants out of drinks. Heavy metal ions stick to, or adsorb to, the surface of the tea leaves, where they stay trapped until the used tea bag is disposed of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the journal &lt;i&gt;ACS Food Science &amp;amp; Technology.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're not suggesting that everyone starts using tea leaves as a water filter," said Northwestern's Vinayak Dravid, the study's senior author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For this study, our goal was to measure tea's ability to adsorb heavy metals. By quantifying this effect, our work highlights the unrecognized potential for tea consumption to passively contribute to reduced heavy metal exposure in populations worldwide."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm not sure that there's anything uniquely remarkable about tea leaves as a material," said Benjamin Shindel, the study's first author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They have a high active surface area, which is a useful property for an adsorbent material and what makes tea leaves good at releasing flavor chemicals rapidly into your water. But what is special is that tea happens to be the most consumed beverage in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You could crush up all kinds of materials to get a similar metal-remediating effect, but that wouldn't necessarily be practical. With tea, people don't need to do anything extra. Just put the leaves in your water and steep them, and they naturally remove metals."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An expert on sorbent materials and sponge entrepreneur, Dravid is Abraham Harris Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering. At the time of the research, Shindel was a Ph.D. student in Dravid's laboratory; now he works with the U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;Exploring different variables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conduct the study, the Northwestern team explored how different types of tea, &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/tea+bags/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tea bags&lt;/a&gt; and brewing methods affect heavy metal adsorption. The various varieties tested included "true" teas such as black, green, oolong and white, as well as chamomile and rooibos teas. They also examined the differences between loose-leaf and commercially bagged tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers created water solutions with known amounts of lead and other metals (chromium, copper, zinc and cadmium), and then heated the solutions to just below boiling temperature. Next, they added the tea leaves, which steeped for various time intervals—from mere seconds to 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After steeping, the team measured how much of the metal content remained in the water. By comparing metal levels before and after adding the tea leaves, they were able to calculate how much was effectively removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cellulose bags work best—and don't release microplastics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After multiple experiments, Dravid, Shindel and their team identified several trends. Perhaps somewhat unsurprising: The bag matters. After testing different types of bags without tea inside, the researchers found cotton and nylon bags only adsorbed trivial amounts of the contaminants. The cellulose bags, however, worked incredibly well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to a successful sorbent material is &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/high+surface+area/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;high surface area&lt;/a&gt;. Similar to how a magnet attaches to a refrigerator door, metal ions cling to the surface of a material. So, the more area for the particles to stick to, the better. Shindel posits that cellulose, which is a biodegradable natural material made from wood pulp, has higher surface area—and therefore more binding sites—than sleeker synthetic materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The cotton and nylon bags remove practically no heavy metals from water," Shindel said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Nylon tea bags are already problematic because they release microplastics, but the majority of tea bags used today are made from natural materials, such as cellulose. These may release micro-particles of cellulose, but that's just fiber which our body can handle."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;Longer steeping time, fewer metals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When comparing different varieties of tea, the researchers discovered tea type and grind played minor roles in adsorbing contaminants. Finely ground tea leaves, particularly black tea leaves, adsorbed slightly more metal ions than whole leaves. Again, the researchers attributed this to surface area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When tea leaves are processed into black tea, they wrinkle and their pores open," Shindel explained. "Those wrinkles and pores add more surface area. Grinding up the leaves also increases surface area, providing even more capacity for binding."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of all the experiments, one factor stood out most. Steeping time played the most significant role in tea leaves' ability to adsorb metal ions. The longer the steeping time, the more contaminants were adsorbed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Any tea that steeps for longer or has higher surface area will effectively remediate more heavy metals," Shindel said. "Some people brew their tea for a matter of seconds, and they are not going to get a lot of remediation. But brewing tea for longer periods or even overnight—like iced tea—will recover most of the metal or maybe even close to all of the metal in the water."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Future opportunities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although results depend on several factors—steeping time and water-to-tea ratio, for example—tea preparation removes an amount of lead from water that should be significant from a public health perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From their experiments, the researchers estimate that tea preparation can remediate about 15% of lead from drinking water, even up to lead concentrations as high as 10 parts per million. That estimate applies only to a "typical" cup of tea, which includes one mug of water and one bag of tea, brewed for three to five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Changing the parameters remediates different levels of lead. Steeping for longer than five minutes, for example, adsorbs more lead compared to the average steeping time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ten parts lead per million is obviously incredibly toxic," Shindel said. "But with lower concentrations of lead, tea leaves should remove a similar fraction of the metal content in the water. The primary limiting factor is how long you brew your tea for."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high-resource areas of the world, it's unlikely that concentrations will reach such high levels. And if there is a water crisis, brewing tea will not solve the problem. But Shindel said the study's results provide useful new information that could be applied to public health research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Across a population, if people drink an extra cup of tea per day, maybe over time we'd see declines in illnesses that are closely correlated with exposure to &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/heavy+metals/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;heavy metals&lt;/a&gt;," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Or it could help explain why populations that drink more tea may have lower incidence rates of heart disease and stroke than populations that have lower &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/tea+consumption/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tea consumption&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest study administered the vaccine to all nine participants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each patient received a total of seven doses of the vaccine during the study (5 doses during the priming phase and 2 during the booster phase).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Four patients received just the vaccine, and five others received small doses of the immunotherapy drug ipilimumab to evaluate how well the vaccine worked on its own, without the added influence of immunotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adding small doses of ipilimumab helped researchers evaluate whether a low dose of this immunotherapy drug could enhance the vaccine's effectiveness &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seven patients had stage three disease, and two had stage four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All nine patients had an immune response to the vaccine, meaning it activated the body’s defenses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The immune system was able to recognize and respond to up to 65 percent of cancer-causing mutations in patients’ tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vaccine uses small protein fragments that are designed to resemble cancer-specific proteins, known as neoantigens, which help the immune system recognize and target the cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The study's lead investigator, Dr. David Braun from Yale Cancer Center, explained that the trial aimed to guide the immune system to focus on a target specific to the tumor. For patients with stage III or IV clear cell renal cell carcinoma, the goal was to reduce the likelihood of cancer recurrence &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kidney and renal pelvis cancer affects 17.2 new cases and 3.4 deaths per 100,000 people annually. About 1.8 percent of people will be diagnosed with this cancer in their lifetime. As of 2021, an estimated 646,960 individuals were living with the disease in the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The shots, developed by a team at the Yale Cancer Center and Dana-Farber Cancer, were designed to train the immune system to recognize only the specific mutations in a patient’s tumor that are not present in normal, healthy cells&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers sequenced the genetics of each patient’s tumors to identify their specific proteins, and peptides were synthesized in the lab to recognize them. Then, those peptides were pooled together to make the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients who received the immune treatment and those who did not saw the same positive results, and no one experienced severe side effects other than flu-like symptoms after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Braun said: ‘This strong and durable activation in T cells was encouraging and indicates that we're able to generate a long-lasting, anti-cancer immune response with the vaccine.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their findings were published in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08507-5#Fig6"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Trials with more patients will be needed to properly gauge its efficacy. Phase two trials are underway, in which a similar PCV will be administered in combination with the targeted therapy, Keytruda, also known as pembrolizumab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the early findings are far from decisive, they are invigorating for the world of oncology research, which has so far struggled to develop a cancer vaccine that can target a broader range of cancers and do so in the way that keeps cancer cells from sidestepping the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Renal cell carcinoma is among the 10 most common cancers worldwide, with more than 400,000 new cases diagnosed annually worldwide and about 80,000 new cases in the US. The highest rates of occurrence appear in the Western world and more often in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Older people, people who smoke, people with obesity, high blood pressure, and genetic conditions, and people with a family history of kidney cancer are more likely to get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kidney cancer diagnoses have been rising steadily, from 6.82 new cases per 100,000 in 1975 to 15.75 in 2022, likely due to better detection, greater awareness, and lifestyle changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

She’s produced a new clutch of eggs for eight years straight, a rarity for a female peregrine, and raised 22 offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But around the start of 2025, she and Archie disappeared from the skies over campus and also from the bell tower’s three 24/7 webcams, one of them focused on the nest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can’t avoid their absence any longer, it’s just too glaring,” said Mary Malec, a Cal Falcons raptor expert. “We have to say what the possibilities are, and what’s most likely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Archie2024-1500.jpg?w=780&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Archie became Annie’s mate in early January 2024, after Annie’s previous mate, Lou, disappeared. Avian flu is now suspected in the disappearances of all three falcons. Credit: Bridget Ahern for UC Berkeley&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cal Falcons, a group of scientists and volunteers, has posted those likelihoods on its &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/Cal_Falcons"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/CalFalconCam"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/calfalcons.bsky.social"&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt; channels, which have followers in 44 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“First of all, we have the elephant in the room: highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI),” the post states. “This virulent and deadly disease is incredibly dangerous to many groups of birds, including shorebirds and raptors. In some species, and for some strains of the disease, mortality is over 90% for infected individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“… It is hitting peregrines very hard right now, probably due, in part, to their habit of taking shorebirds and waterfowl, the latter of which tend to be carriers of HPAI.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post adds that in some parts of the peregrine’s range, nearly 50% of historic territories are unoccupied due to avian flu, and that case positivity rates are pushing 80%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last fall, an &lt;a href="https://www.audubon.org/magazine/why-are-peregrine-falcon-numbers-falling-united-states-again"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audubon Magazine&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; reported a decline in peregrine falcon numbers “not seen since the DDT era” in the 1960s and ‘70s, when the raptors were near extinction due to widespread use of the pesticide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Berkeley, Cal Falcons members have looked in vain for evidence of a sick or dying falcon on the bell tower and at Annie and Archie’s other favorite local roosts. They’ve also been searching eBird reports and Instagram photos. Neither Annie nor Archie wears an ID band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/moon_rabbit_rising/?hl=en"&gt;Bridget Ahern&lt;/a&gt;, a wildlife photographer who for years has chronicled the campus’s falcon family, said she last photographed Annie on Jan. 4, and that her most recent photo of Archie is from late December. She saw the pair mating around that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On campus recently, Ahern left her camera behind to focus on searching for the birds. “I was walking with my binoculars,” she said, “and saying, ‘Come on, Annie!’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-floaters-are-absent-too"&gt;Floaters are absent, too&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Bay Area, Cal Falcons reports that 40% of peregrine territories currently are unoccupied, and that aside from a few very brief sightings of a couple other falcons on campus, “it has been exceptionally quiet this winter.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s bad news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aside from the fact that it looks like we’ve lost Annie and Archie, the most alarming thing is that we don’t have replacement falcons,” said Malec. “We’ve always had floaters around, and floaters are absolutely necessary when birds age out or get sick or injured. Without them, there is no one to breed with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Floaters have no fixed territory and fly within a region in search of a nesting area or mate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Floaters are a sign of a healthy population and ecosystem,” the Cal Falcons post says. “The decrease in the number of floaters is also an indication that HPAI is affecting not just breeding pairs, but birds looking for their own territories, as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 10 Bay Area peregrine falcon sites that Malec recently monitored, there were falcons at only three. Two sites had a pair of falcons, she said, the third had a single bird. The other seven sites were empty, but “it is still early in the season,” she added, “and there is time for pairs to form and nesting to occur.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for whether Annie and Archie might have moved to another territory, Malec said that raptors “show such strong fealty for their territories” that it’s rare for them to leave a home they’ve established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, there were regular sightings of floaters looking to take over the territory of the Berkeley falcons, who often had to aggressively protect it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 2022, for example, when &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2022/02/28/wheres-annie-berkeleys-beloved-peregrine-falcon-is-missing/"&gt;Annie vanished&lt;/a&gt; for more than a week during nesting season, several unattached female falcons circled the tower, eyeing her home and longtime mate, Grinnell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The floaters left after &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2022/03/01/annie-the-falcon-presumed-long-gone-returns-to-berkeleys-campanile/#:~:text=community%2C%20Campus%20news-,Annie%20the%20falcon%2C%20presumed%20long%20gone%2C%20returns%20to%20Berkeley's%20Campanile,'"&gt;Annie’s unexpected return&lt;/a&gt; to the Campanile on March 1, but a female intruder threatened the nest several times after that, and Grinnell defended his home from a female early on March 31. Later that day, he was &lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyside.org/2022/03/31/beloved-falcon-grinnell-found-dead"&gt;found dead&lt;/a&gt; in downtown Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, Malec added, “Grinnell was replaced by &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2022/04/18/its-alden-record-number-of-voters-chose-new-berkeley-falcons-name/"&gt;Alden&lt;/a&gt; in just seven hours — seven.” She was referring to the falcon who speedily took Grinnell’s spot at the bell tower and helped Annie incubate the eggs in the nest. He disappeared in late 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="were-all-clinging-to-hope"&gt;‘We’re all clinging to hope’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peterson said there is a slim possibility that Annie and Archie are on an extended hunting trip, as there are “huge swaths of unoccupied hunting grounds out there due to HPAI.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or it could be that predators, like great horned owls or eagles, harmed the pair, he added, or that some other dynamic is occurring “that we don’t understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If avian flu is the culprit, it’s not the first time the disease may have struck Berkeley’s falcon family. In winter 2024, Annie’s then-mate, &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/01/30/nesting-season-is-here-with-a-new-mate-for-uc-berkeley-s-peregrine-falcon-annie/"&gt;Lou, disappeared&lt;/a&gt;, and Cal Falcons suspected HPAI. &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/02/19/it-s-archie-contest-ends-to-name-uc-berkeley-s-new-male-peregrine-falcon/"&gt;Archie&lt;/a&gt; took Lou’s place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it’s strongly assumed that one of Annie and Grinnell’s offspring, Sequoia, died of HPAI, since &lt;a href="https://baynature.org/2023/04/13/avian-flu-claims-at-least-6-california-condors-and-a-beloved-bay-area-peregrine-falcon/"&gt;it was confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that his mate, Shasta, contracted it in late March 2023. The two lived on San Jose City Hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Annie and Archie don’t return, said Malec, there’s always hope that the nest box atop the tower will be inhabited by falcons again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a really good place for peregrines,” she said, “They will know it’s been a successful nest site by the whitewash (excrement) on the tower.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Peterson said it could take some time for younger falcons to fill open territories after the HPAI outbreak wanes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless new raptors claim the tower, Cal Falcons is not giving up hope that the pair will return there, where they could successfully nest as late as May and raise chicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studying biology, you learn over and over again that totally unexpected things can happen,” said Peterson. “There’s so much random change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annie, the fierce matriarch and a campus mainstay since late 2016, “could still show up, she still could,” he continued. “I don’t think it’s likely, but &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2022/02/28/wheres-annie-berkeleys-beloved-peregrine-falcon-is-missing/"&gt;we’ve written her obit before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re all clinging to hope, even if it’s a meager amount.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, photographer Ahern has decided how to answer people who approach her on campus, wondering where the falcons are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If people ask me,” she said, “I say I haven’t seen them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group is-style-border"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-newspack-blocks-homepage-articles  wpnbha is-grid columns-3 colgap-3 show-image image-aligntop ts-1 is-3 is-landscape  has-text-align-left"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to age like a fine wine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/19/health/5-easy-exercises-to-do-at-home-to-test-how-well-youre-aging/"&gt;Everyone loses muscle mass&lt;/a&gt; as they get older. &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/20/health/sign-in-your-jaw-could-mean-60-higher-chance-of-dementia/"&gt;Sarcopenia is a significant loss&lt;/a&gt; of muscle mass and strength, which increases the risk of falls, hospitalization, less independence and premature death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Rutgers and other universities &lt;a href="https://wne.edu/news/2025/02/new-research-shows-grapes-improve-muscle-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;may have found a simple and tasty approach&lt;/a&gt; to maintaining muscle along with exercise and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/28/health/dietitian-reveals-best-time-to-eat-protein-to-reach-health-goals/"&gt;high-protein diets&lt;/a&gt; — grapes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This study provides compelling evidence that grapes have the potential to enhance muscle health at the genetic level,” said John Pezzuto, senior investigator of the new study and dean of pharmacy and health sciences at Western New England University.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Given their safety profile and widespread availability, it will be exciting to explore how quickly these changes can be observed in human trials,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors of the new study found that consuming the equivalent of two servings of grapes a day altered over 20,000 genes in elderly mice, significantly influencing how their muscles generate energy to function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genes tied to lean muscle mass were elevated, while genes linked to muscle deterioration were suppressed. Female mice saw greater benefits than male mice, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mice consumed 5% grape powder, which is around 1.5 cups of fresh grapes for humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pezzuto’s team plans to study how and why these genetic changes happen and if they can be replicated in humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, other foods that can help build and maintain muscle include lean meats, fish, eggs, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/23/health/greek-yogurt-benefits-revealed-how-to-choose-healthiest-one/"&gt;Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt;, quinoa, beans and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/23/health/dietitian-reveals-cows-milk-soy-milk-to-be-healthiest-milks"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Vitamin K2 is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays many different roles in the body. Vitamin K2 is found in animal foods and fermented food and can also be made by bacteria in the gut,” says &lt;a href="https://amydavisrd.com/recipes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amy Davis, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist. She adds that vitamin K2 is involved in various reactions in the body, supporting everything from bone and cardiovascular health to blood clotting.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Vitamin K2 helps regulate calcium in the body, directing it to bones and teeth while preventing buildup in arteries and soft tissues. This is essential for bone strength and cardiovascular health,” adds &lt;a href="https://www.thesportsnutritionplaybook.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amy Goodson, M.S., RD, CSSD, LD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A vitamin K deficiency is very rare among most healthy adults. However, it can occur in individuals with malabsorption disorders or those taking medications that interfere with vitamin K absorption, such as antibiotics. People with gastrointestinal conditions like celiac disease or ulcerative colitis may have difficulty absorbing vitamin K. Individuals who have undergone bariatric surgery may also be at risk for being low in vitamin K.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since there isn’t enough data to establish a precise daily requirement for vitamin K, an Adequate Intake level has been set to ensure nutritional adequacy. For adults 19 and older, the AI is 120 micrograms per day for males and 90 mcg per day for females, including during pregnancy.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Supports Bone Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although you can’t see them, you can’t forget about &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-bone-health-8737183" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;your bones and their health&lt;/a&gt;. Vitamin K2 is important for strengthening them by activating a protein that helps bind calcium to the bone.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Studies suggest that adequate K2 intake can help improve bone mineral density, particularly in older adults and postmenopausal women, who are at higher risk of osteoporosis,” explains Goodson. She adds that the body utilizes calcium to strengthen bones, reducing the risk of fractures and lowering the likelihood of breaks.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Promotes Heart Health  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin K2 also plays a role in keeping your heart healthy. “Vitamin K2 helps prevent calcium buildup in the arteries, reducing arterial stiffness and lowering the risk of heart disease,” says Davis. When arteries become less flexible, it makes it harder for blood to flow easily, thus increasing the risk of heart-related issues, such as high blood pressure, heart disease and even heart failure. “Studies suggest that adequate K2 intake is linked to better cardiovascular outcomes over time,” says Davis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Enhance Brain Function  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As we age, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8044818/what-happens-to-your-brain-as-you-age/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;our brain function naturally declines&lt;/a&gt;, making tasks like recalling information or solving problems more challenging. “Emerging research suggests a potential role in cognitive health and reducing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases,” says Goodson. She says vitamin K2 does this by reducing oxidative stress and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and producing sphingolipids, a type of fat essential for brain function and communication. Therefore, a higher intake of vitamin K2 may keep your brain firing quickly from all cylinders and potentially lower the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, such as dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Supports Dental Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin K2 supports your smile. “Vitamin K2 contributes to oral health by supporting dentin production and activating osteocalcin, which helps maintain strong teeth,” says Davis. Dentin is the tissue inside your teeth. And osteocalcin activates a protein that helps strengthen teeth.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;She adds that some research suggests that vitamin K2 may also work hand-in-hand with other fat-soluble vitamins, like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8034163/benefits-vitamin-d/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D3&lt;/a&gt;, to improve tooth remineralization. This means it can help reduce tooth loss and decay.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you are a fan of Popeye, you’re likely loading up on leafy greens like spinach and collards, which are an &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-rich-in-vitamin-k-8635254" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;excellent source of vitamin K&lt;/a&gt;. But if you are looking for vitamin K2, you’ll want to focus on different foods.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Here are some of the best food sources of vitamin K2:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animal proteins like ground beef, chicken breast, chicken liver, ham&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dairy foods including Cheddar cheese, mozzarella and dairy milk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/281916/must-eat-fermented-foods-for-a-healthy-gut/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Fermented foods&lt;/a&gt; like natto (fermented soybeans) and sauerkraut&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eggs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Keep in mind that vitamin K2 is a fat-soluble vitamin, meaning it’s best absorbed when paired with fat. So, don’t skip out on including a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7993588/ways-to-add-healthy-fat-to-your-meals/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy source of fat&lt;/a&gt; at these mealtimes for better absorption.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There is no established upper limit for vitamin K due to its low potential for toxicity. Vitamin K2 is generally safe, but high doses may interfere with blood-thinning medications like warfarin. Goodson says mild side effects may include stomach discomfort but are also rare.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-who-should-take-a-vitamin-k2-supplement-and-who-should-avoid-it"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Who Should Take a Vitamin K2 Supplement and Who Should Avoid It? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Individuals who are vegetarians or vegans may benefit from taking a vitamin K2 supplement, as vitamin K2 is mostly found in animal products like chicken, beef, eggs and dairy products. Goodson explains that vitamin K1, commonly found in plant-based foods (like spinach), is poorly absorbed compared to vitamin K2, which is more bioavailable. People looking to support their bone health and keep their hearts strong may also benefit from vitamin K2 supplementation. It’s important to always consult your primary health care provider before starting any supplement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;However, certain groups should avoid supplementation:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Anyone on blood thinners, such as warfarin (Coumadin) and similar anticoagulants, can have serious and potentially dangerous interactions. People on these medications are advised to keep a steady intake of vitamin K from food and/or supplements and avoid drastic changes in intake. Consider working with a dietitian for guidance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone taking antibiotics, as antibiotics can disrupt bacteria in the gut and decrease vitamin K status.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People taking weight-loss medications like Orlistat may experience reduced vitamin K absorption, as this medication reduces the body’s ability to absorb dietary fat.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-look-for-in-a-vitamin-k2-supplement"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Look For in a Vitamin K2 Supplement &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Vitamin K is often found in multivitamins or multimineral supplements. However, if you are looking for a single vitamin, Davis recommends choosing one in the MK-7 form of vitamin K2 for better absorption and longer-lasting effects. She also recommends a soft-gel, oil-based formula, as pairing the supplement with fat ensures maximal absorption. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Secondly, look for a supplement that has undergone independent verification to ensure its high quality and safety. Look for seals from trusted organizations like ConsumerLab, NSF international or USP on the label. Next, look for one that is free from unnecessary ingredients and doesn’t list proprietary blends, formulas or complexes under ingredients. These steps ensure you do not ingest heavy metals or other contaminants.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Vitamin K2 plays a role in maintaining bone and heart health and supporting blood clotting. It also plays a role in cognitive functioning and dental health. Vitamin K2 is found in animal products and fermented foods. For enhanced absorption, pair a vitamin K2 supplement with a source of fat or look for a supplement that is in an oil-based formula and soft-gel form. Remember, eating a well-balanced diet is one way to ensure you consume enough vitamins and minerals, including vitamin K2. Before beginning any new supplementation, check with your doctor to ensure it’s safe for you.&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Aidan Giles, his 33-year-old grandson, said: “We were shocked and devastated when we found out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was in his urethra and it was stuck in there and went to the edge of his bladder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My grandfather was bed-bound and his world was slowly going because of this stuck catheter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The family has grave concerns about patient care at Northampton General Hospital (NGH). There are numerous issues, but the most glaring is that doctors failed to remove the catheter fragment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were told they didn’t believe the scan. Instead, my grandfather was repeatedly given antibiotics to fight off a UTI when, in reality, the retained catheter was causing scarring, persistent infections, and at least one episode of sepsis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Giles, who had a grandson and two great-grandchildren, was admitted to NGH in November 2021 after having problems urinating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His family said he became virtually immune to the effects of antibiotics and pushed for a full-body scan after being left puzzled by the repeated infections and weakened state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But hospital staff allegedly refused the scan and instead opted to place him on end of life care, his family claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a two-year battle, a CT scan was finally carried out and the broken piece of catheter was found and removed in April last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;‘It brought him closer to death’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aidan added: “He was such a trooper but he must have been in a lot of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe this could have been mitigated if they had taken this catheter out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He was struggling, he was struggling with pain and breathing. It wasn’t nice for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have no doubts that having it inside him brought him closer to death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cause of death listed on Mr Giles’ death certificate is old age and frailty, along with dementia, cardiac failure and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An inquest into his death will take place in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie Hogg, chief nurse at University Hospitals of Northamptonshire NHS Trust, said: “I met with Mr Giles recently to offer my apologies for the care that his grandfather received and our poor communication with his family subsequently, we should have done better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We provide care for hundreds of thousands of patients each year and, while many experience good care, we know that unfortunately we don’t always get it right for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are absolutely committed to listening to our patients and making things better.”&lt;/p&gt;

He joined the U.S. Marine Corps when he was 17 and served in World War II and the Korean War. The veteran is a survivor of the &lt;a href="https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/topics/battle-iwo-jima" target="_blank"&gt;Battle of Iwo Jima&lt;/a&gt;, fought 80 years ago, and watched the &lt;a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/article/joe-rosenthal-and-flag-raising-iwo-jima" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. flag-raisin&lt;/a&gt;g on the island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Caminiti later worked for decades making bearings for a division of General Motors in Connecticut.

He had a paper route as a kid and used to go to a Boys Club when he was 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Today, he goes to the gym every morning from Monday to Friday. He walks on a treadmill for 30-40 minutes, then uses weight machines to strengthen the muscles in his legs, arms and other areas of his body. He finishes by lying on a hydro massage bed to relax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Some people get a trainer to show them what they want to do, but at my age, I don’t need a trainer. I’ve been going to the gym since I was a kid,” Caminiti says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Nothing needs to motivate me.

Whenever they put (it) in front of me, I ate it,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“He ate healthy, but he also ate pretty much whatever he wanted,” his son adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The centenarian has recently lost weight because of an esophagus problem, which makes it hard for food to go down — a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7102894/" target="_blank"&gt;common issue as people age&lt;/a&gt; — so he now has to take his time to eat and choose foods carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But he still loves dessert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Oh, yes. I have ice cream almost every night.

She still cooks their meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“It’s a regular apartment house,” Caminiti emphasizes. “Assisted living — I don’t need that yet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 17:56:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNTk1seVJWYmcyWi1xaTc1UFktZGN0V0FRanJ5eV9DNWtHYUV6cG5rc3pHbTVMUlE5eS01NWNZTzctMnZYZi01eEhnYTdNU016dlBfamhCOVAtYzAxS2tndE9ULWhDWG04OTltNHN6WDRTSFBXQU4xRnJMSGktdkFXQ0s3SU13c1FwcmNV0gFUQVVfeXFMUFB5TnJJMlBDREoyWlpmSVhfZzlzWW9IQkwxZ1dIZ2k5RjNmYWs5elZJWG1ydkxITElyekhtLTJnV0t5VHFzZExZY1l3ZmV0clNMWUxK</guid></item><item><title>Pancreatic cancer RNA vaccine shows durable T cell immunity - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNa0JEZTNqTm9GLTE4RHAxRFpYUU5XM0xzYV9aUTB4dW1zekRVZWNLMW1zT0dBZXhLX3gzbFp6dnJ3cmNXNkg1Um5vU0h1a2puUDNsbXgxNGNGNi1sbi1pVk96UEk5UUQ4Q3FHZHhqOXpxdjBWbFJTeG5yUFhpSU9pSjNQZHpUbndZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-byline text-low"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center researchers have found RNA neoantigen vaccines that generate long-lived, functional CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), potentially delaying disease recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;PDAC is a lethal cancer with limited treatment options and a low mutational burden. T cells defend the body by destroying harmful outside pathogens and mutated body cells, such as cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutations in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/tumor+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tumor cells&lt;/a&gt; can create neoantigens, novel proteins not present in normal cells. Finding these (via MHC molecules) alerts T cells that the tumor cell is no longer part of the body's normal self. The low mutational burden of PDAC produces few neoantigens, making tumors difficult for T cells to distinguish from self cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional cancer vaccines have struggled to produce durable tumor-specific T cell responses. This study aimed to determine if an RNA neoantigen vaccine could induce long-term functional T cells that correlate with delayed PDAC recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Phase I trial, "RNA neoantigen vaccines prime long-lived CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/pancreatic+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt;," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08508-4" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;, the team evaluated the effects of autogene cevumeran, an individualized mRNA–lipoplex vaccine encoding up to 20 neoantigens, combined with surgery, atezolizumab, and chemotherapy (mFOLFIRINOX).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixteen patients with resectable PDAC received autogene cevumeran following surgery and a single dose of atezolizumab, succeeded by 12 cycles of modified FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy and a vaccine boost. Investigators assessed vaccine-induced T cell responses using ex vivo IFNγ ELISpot assays, T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, and longitudinal blood and tissue analyses over a median follow-up of 3.2 years.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Eight of the sixteen vaccinated patients developed strong neoantigen-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell responses following vaccination. These patients, referred to as responders, experienced fewer cancer recurrences during the study period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A median time to recurrence for the responders could not be determined since the majority had not relapsed by the study's end. Highly favorable survival outcomes of the responders were compared to a median of 13.4 months in non-responders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CloneTrack, a sequencing-based tool, identified 79 vaccine-induced CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell clones in responders. Clones induced during priming doses reached peak expansion after six or fewer doses, with an average 100-fold expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccine-induced CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell clones demonstrated long-term persistence, with a projected average lifespan of 7.7 years post-boost. 86% of clones persisted at substantial frequencies for ~3 years post-vaccination. Approximately 20% of these clones could persist for decades, potentially outliving the host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccine-induced T cells transitioned from proliferative to effector states and stabilized as tissue-resident memory-like (TRM-like) cells, retaining cytotoxic functions for years. Persistent CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells maintained neoantigen-specific effector function upon in vitro rechallenge, even up to 3.6 years post-vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumors from &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/patients/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;patients&lt;/a&gt; who recurred showed a selective loss of vaccine-targeted cancer clones, indicating the need to address tumor heterogeneity and clonal escape mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential of adjuvant mRNA–lipoplex neoantigen vaccines to induce durable, functional immunity (after surgery) in one of the most treatment-resistant cancers is clearly established (for a Phase I trial) with potential applications to cancers beyond PDAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larger trials are needed to confirm efficacy and further research on increasing responder rates and reducing clonal escape.&lt;/p&gt;

At least 16 people have been admitted to the hospital. Nine cases of measles have also been reported in the neighboring state of New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;According to officials at the Texas Department of State Health Services, the outbreak has been concentrated in the northwest of the state. At least 77 of these cases are in children, with 26 being 4 years old or younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that can be deadly.

The first measles vaccine arrived in 1963, and following its rollout in the US, cases across the country &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.idsociety.org/public-health/measles/know-the-facts/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.idsociety.org/public-health/measles/know-the-facts/"}' href="https://www.idsociety.org/public-health/measles/know-the-facts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fell by 97 percent&lt;/a&gt; between 1965 and 1968. Massive &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/vaccines/"&gt;worldwide vaccination campaigns&lt;/a&gt; then spread these gains across the globe. Between 1980 and 2015, worldwide cases fell by 95 percent thanks to the combined vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), which is given in two doses starting at 1 year of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;However, skepticism about the effects of vaccines, including MMR, has spread throughout the world. For example, the current outbreak in Texas has centered around Gaines County, which has one of the highest vaccine exemption rates in the state (&lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/conscientious-exemptions" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/conscientious-exemptions"}' href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/conscientious-exemptions" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;18 percent&lt;/a&gt;). Many of the patients are children whose parents chose not to immunize them against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;While most states in the US require students to have the MMR vaccine to attend school, some states allow families to request an exemption from vaccination for their children, even for nonmedical reasons. Texas is one such state. In the current outbreak, 85 of the 90 measles cases are in unvaccinated people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“We respect everyone’s right to get vaccinated or not,” Albert Pilkington, CEO of the Seminole Hospital District in Gaines Country, told the Texas Standard. “That’s what being an American is all about, isn’t it?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In 2024, 285 measles cases were reported in the United States, the highest number since 2019. Forty-two percent were children under the age of 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The outlook for preventing this disease is not bright. The measles outbreak in Texas comes just a week after &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/robert-f-kennedy-jr/"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; was confirmed as head of the US Department of Health and Human Services.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;]Eating an orange a day may lower a person's depression risk by 20%, according to a &lt;a href="https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-024-01961-3" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;i&gt;Microbiome&lt;/i&gt;. That might be because citrus stimulates the growth of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii), a type of bacteria found in the human gut, to influence production of the neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine—two biological molecules known to elevate mood.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The study was led by Raaj Mehta, an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School and a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital. In this edited conversation with the Gazette, Mehta discusses key takeaways from the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What inspired this study?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was working with a fantastic postdoc named Chatpol Samuthpongtorn, who was reading through the literature on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/depression/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, looking for an interesting project to take on. And he came across this &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522045932" target="_blank"&gt;one paper&lt;/a&gt; from 2016 that pointed to the possibility that citrus lowers the risk of depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That piqued our interest because we had access to a rich data set that we could use to follow up on this finding. It's called the &lt;a href="https://nurseshealthstudy.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Nurses' Health Study II (NHS2)&lt;/a&gt;, and it began in 1989 with the goal of finding risk factors for major chronic diseases in women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It involves more than 100,000 women, and roughly every two years they provide researchers with detailed information about their lifestyle, diet, medication use, and health. So we decided to leverage these data to look for evidence that nurses who ate a lot of citrus had lower rates of future depression than those who did not. And that's what we found!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;How big an effect is this? Does it compare to traditional antidepressants?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that eating one medium orange a day may lower the risk of developing depression by about 20%. And the effect seems to be specific to citrus. When we look at people's total fruit or vegetable consumption, or at other individual fruits such as apples or bananas, we don't see any relationship between intake and risk of depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to compare the effectiveness of citrus to traditional antidepressants, such as &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/ssris/art-20044825" target="_blank"&gt;selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors&lt;/a&gt;, because we're talking about preventing depression, and those drugs are usually used to treat depression once a person is already experiencing it. In the future, eating citrus could perhaps be part of a strategy for managing depression that also involves these more traditional pharmaceuticals. But more research is needed before we can conclude that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So walk me through the logic. How exactly do you think eating oranges lowers the risk of depression?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One unique part of the study is that a subset of participants in the NHS2 gave researchers several samples of their stool over the course of a year. Using DNA sequencing results from these stool samples, we looked for links between citrus intake and particular species of bacteria in the gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One species of bacteria stood out—F. prausnitzii was more abundant in people who were not depressed than people who were, and consuming a lot of citrus was also associated with high levels of F. prausnitzii. So we think this bacterium may link citrus consumption with good mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the NHS2 only includes women, we wanted to confirm the findings in a study involving men. So we turned to a similar study, called the Men's Lifestyle Validation Study, where we also saw increasing levels of F. prausnitzii were inversely correlated with depression risk scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then the question became, how is F. prausnitzii making people feel better? One answer, we think, might be that these bacteria use a metabolic pathway known as the S-adenosyl-L-methionine cycle I pathway to influence levels of two neurotransmitters—serotonin and &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22581-dopamine" target="_blank"&gt;dopamine&lt;/a&gt;—produced by human cells in the gut. These neurotransmitters regulate how food passes through the digestive tract, but they can also travel to the brain, where they elevate mood.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Were you surprised by the findings?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes and no. There's so much evidence now suggesting a strong link between the gut and the brain that I was not surprised to find more. At the same time, I had not associated citrus with the brain before we got these results. You often hear that fish is "brain food," but nobody says that oranges are brain food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, F. prausnitzii has been linked to good health in lots of ways, like by lowering the risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease. But I wasn't aware of a link between F. prausnitzii and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next for this research?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to see a clinical trial done to definitively show that eating citrus can lower the risk of depression, or maybe even alleviate the condition in some cases. There's such a huge unmet need for depression treatments, and eating citrus doesn't really have any major side effects, so it would be great to see how much this simple treatment can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly, I hope our results inspire other researchers to look into the link between diet and mental health. I think people know intuitively that the foods we eat impact our mood. We even have a term for this: comfort foods, which make us feel better in the short term.

					&lt;p&gt;The National Health Service (NHS) paid a six-figure compensation to an unnamed woman after she developed a crippling &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; addiction after the side effects of a prescription drug impaired her impulse control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medicine (intended to treat restless leg syndrome and Parkinson’s) is in a class of drugs known as dopamine agonists. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter responsible for feelings of reward, and the artificial increase caused by these drugs can make someone seek out more of it — and that’s something mobile games excel at providing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small rewards, like opening a &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/hoyoverse-facing-20m-fine-over-loot-box-mechanics/"&gt;loot box&lt;/a&gt;, receiving a new item, or just finishing a level, all generate a boost of dopamine in the brain. Within weeks of her prescription, the woman began to “obsessively” play &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; before progressing to virtual slot machine games.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14425115/payout-NHS-addiction-Candy-Crush.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;NHS has since admitted&lt;/a&gt; that her general practitioner failed to warn her of the side effects and prescribed her a dose double the recommended amount. She has since been granted £170,000 (roughly $215,000) in compensation from the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_3166962" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3166962" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-dt-lazy-src="https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Candy-Crush-Saga.webp?fit=720%2C432&amp;amp;p=1" decoding="async" class=" size-large wp-image-3166962 h-lightbox is-zoomable dt-lazy-load dt-lazy-pending" alt="Candy Crush Saga being played on a web browser or tablet."&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-3166962" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;King&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time a situation like this has arisen. Another man was prescribed the same medication, and then went on to lose more than £100,000 in online gambling. The NHS covered those costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No update has been given on how either of the two patients are doing. Suggested treatment to correct the loss of impulse control is a gradual reduction of the dosage before switching to a different type of medication, as well as other medications and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; isn’t to blame for the situation, but it does reveal the risks of games designed to hook the player in with rapid rewards — especially on individuals who are more susceptible to gaming addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/who-gaming-disorder/"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; has considered video game addiction a mental health disorder since 2013. Though numerous studies have been conducted, the results remain unclear as conclusions vary across different groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Indiana county is reporting its first case of chronic wasting disease (CWD), less than a year after the state's first detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2.5-year-old white-tailed buck in &lt;a href="https://events.in.gov/event/second-positive-case-of-chronic-wasting-disease-confirmed-in-indiana?utm_campaign=widget&amp;amp;utm_medium=widget&amp;amp;utm_source=State+of+Indiana"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Posey County&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tested positive after being harvested by a hunter, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR) said in a news release late last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The county is in the southwestern part of Indiana, on the border with CWD-positive Illinois and CWD-positive Kentucky, the far opposite of &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/chronic-wasting-disease/indiana-confirms-its-first-chronic-wasting-disease-detection"&gt;&lt;span&gt;LaGrange County&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where the state's first case was discovered in April 2024. LaGrange County abuts CWD-positive Michigan. The other state that borders Indiana, Ohio, has also reported cases of the fatal neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 2025-2026 deer hunting season, DNR will enhance its surveillance efforts in Posey County and the surrounding counties to determine the extent of disease in this area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"During the 2025-2026 deer hunting season, DNR will enhance its surveillance efforts in Posey County and the surrounding counties to determine the extent of disease in this area," the DNR said. "This will allow biologists to develop a targeted response based on the prevalence of CWD in this part of Indiana. CWD testing will be voluntary for hunters in this area."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cooking doesn't neutralize prions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CWD, a disease of cervids such as deer, moose, and elk, is caused by infectious misfolded proteins called prions, which spread through direct contact and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease isn't known to infect people, but some experts fear it could cause illness similar to another prion disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("mad cow" disease). The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns against eating meat from infected animals, as cooking temperatures cannot deactivate prions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not announce its plans to participate in advance but confirmed its role Monday in an email response to STAT.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“CDC will be actively participating virtually at the WHO vaccine consultation meeting for the recommendation of viruses for 2025-26 Northern Hemisphere vaccine this week,” CDC spokesperson Benjamin Haynes said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The weeklong meeting began Monday, with experts from both the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration in virtual attendance. With the exception of Haynes, all sources who spoke with STAT for this article requested they not be identified by name because they hadn’t been authorized to speak. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To attend the meeting, even virtually, the two agencies would have had to receive an exemption from the Trump administration due to its &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/27/cdc-ordered-stop-working-with-world-health-organization/"&gt;ban on all interactions with the WHO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;President Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/20/trump-order-us-withdrawal-world-health-organization-historic-policy-shift/"&gt;announcing that the United States will withdraw from the WHO&lt;/a&gt;. And since the earliest days of the new administration, government agencies have been ordered to cease all dealings with the Geneva-based global health agency, and to halt the dispersal of all funding to it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The flu strain selection meeting, though, would have created a quandary for the administration. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Twice a year, experts from around the world gather to determine which strains of flu should be in the next version of flu vaccines. The vaccines take months to make, bottle, and distribute, so these meetings typically take place toward the end of one flu season to prepare for the next.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This week’s meeting, for the 2025-2026 Northern Hemisphere flu vaccines, is being held at the Francis Crick Institute in London. The meeting for the Southern Hemisphere 2026 flu vaccine will be held in September.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to making recommendations on the viruses seasonal flu vaccines should target, the group also reviews what is happening with flu viruses like H5N1 bird flu and other flu viruses that pose a pandemic risk. The goal of these discussions is to determine if existing candidate vaccine viruses — effectively seed strains with which to make vaccines to target these novel viruses — are still effective or should be updated. Some countries, notably the United States, make and stockpile supplies of vaccines to use in the event that some of these flu viruses circulating in birds or animals begin to transmit among humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The decisions are made by experts from seven WHO collaborating centers on influenza and four essential regulatory laboratories, located in Australia, China, Japan, Russian, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The CDC is one of the collaborating centers and the FDA one of the essential regulatory labs, giving U.S. government scientists two of the 11 votes — though decisions are made by consensus rather than straight votes. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The CDC stopped contributing influenza data to two WHO-managed databases, FluNet and FluID, on Jan. 24, Maria Van Kerkhove, acting director of the WHO’s department of epidemic and pandemic threat management, said recently. Data from earlier in the flu season had already been shared, but in a process designed to predict what’s going to happen months from now, the viruses that are circulating now are more relevant than reports on what circulated months ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ban on interacting with the WHO left in doubt whether the CDC and FDA scientists would be allowed to attend the strain selection meeting, which in turn raised questions about how the FDA would instruct suppliers of flu vaccines for the U.S. market what it believes next winter’s shots should target. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The FDA typically holds a meeting of its expert panel, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, in March to go over the discussions that arose at the WHO strain selection meeting and finalize choices for the vaccines to be used in this country. It is currently unclear whether VRBPAC will meet next month. Many meetings of advisory committees have been canceled or postponed without rescheduling, since the new administration took office, including one of the CDC’s advisory committee, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/acip-cdc-vaccine-meeting-postponed/"&gt;which was meant to meet this week&lt;/a&gt;. There are &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;no upcoming VRBPAC meetings&lt;/a&gt; listed on the FDA’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

and in more detail - which could mean more timely treatment and fewer  costly tests and procedures, lead researcher Dr Konrad Wagstyl said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The AI would require human oversight, however, and many of the abnormalities were still missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"It's like finding one character on five pages of solid black text,"  Dr Wagstyl said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"AI can find about two-thirds that doctors miss - but a third are still really difficult to find."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;At one hospital in Italy, the tool identified a subtle lesion missed by radiologists, in a 12-year-old boy who had tried nine different medications but still had seizures every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f4e1/live/9fe5b8a0-f2a6-11ef-b1bc-c7140a41b5a8.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f4e1/live/9fe5b8a0-f2a6-11ef-b1bc-c7140a41b5a8.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f4e1/live/9fe5b8a0-f2a6-11ef-b1bc-c7140a41b5a8.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f4e1/live/9fe5b8a0-f2a6-11ef-b1bc-c7140a41b5a8.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f4e1/live/9fe5b8a0-f2a6-11ef-b1bc-c7140a41b5a8.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f4e1/live/9fe5b8a0-f2a6-11ef-b1bc-c7140a41b5a8.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f4e1/live/9fe5b8a0-f2a6-11ef-b1bc-c7140a41b5a8.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f4e1/live/9fe5b8a0-f2a6-11ef-b1bc-c7140a41b5a8.png.webp" alt="King's College London One male researcher stands, pointing at a computer screen, while two female researchers sit in front of the screen, with one holding a computer mouse." class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 fxQYxK"&gt;King's College London&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw"&gt;Dr Konrad Wagstyl and fellow researchers work on the AI algorithm&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Study co-author and childhood epilepsy consultant Prof Helen Cross said it had the potential "to rapidly identify abnormalities that can be removed and potentially cure the epilepsy".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Uncontrolled epilepsy was "incapacitating", she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Many of the children she sees as a consultant at Great Ormond Street Hospital have had years of seizures and investigations before a lesion is found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Charity Epilepsy Action said the new AI tool's potential was "really exciting" and could give people faster diagnosis, but did not solve the issue of lack of specialist epilepsy nurses in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"It remains early days and, as always, we must proceed with caution," said Ley Sander from the Epilepsy Society, adding that if the tool could identify more people as candidates for brain surgery, that could be "life-changing for many more people with epilepsy".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The researchers are hoping for official approval to use MELD Graph as a diagnostic tool -

An individual from Gaines County who tested positive for the virus visited the university’s main campus, Ripley’s Believe It or Not, Mr. Crabby’s Seafood and Bar and other tourist locations, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The department said that anyone at those locations in the hours between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. CST and at the restaurant between 6 and 8 p.m. should monitor for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Measles is a highly contagious virus that can lead to serious complications, especially in young children and individuals with weakened immune systems. If you think you may have been exposed or are showing symptoms, please contact your healthcare provider immediately,” Metro Health Deputy Director Dr. Anita Kurian said in a &lt;a href="https://www.sa.gov/Directory/News/News-Releases/Possible-Measles-Exposures-in-San-Antonio" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:statement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So far, 99 people have been sickened in the outbreak across Texas and New Mexico, leading to a coordinated response from health authorities who are concerned about how many cases have yet to be detected across the region. Many of the cases have come among unvaccinated people as health officials stress the importance of the vaccine to prevent against the disease that has been eradicated in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major measles outbreak has infected nearly 100 people across Texas and New Mexico this year. Health officials believe that more cases will be confirmed (AP)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In San Marcos, less than an hour away from San Antonio, a Gaines County resident visited Texas State University and the Twin Peaks Restaurant on February 14. People near the university from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. and at the restaurant from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. may be at risk of developing measles, health officials warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People in those areas during those times or up to two hours later should monitor for symptoms. The Hays County Health Department said that those who may have been exposed will be notified by their local health authority. State agencies are working together to investigate potential contacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Measles is a highly contagious airborne disease spread by contact with an infected person through coughing and sneezing. Texas is currently experiencing the largest outbreak of measles in decades,” &lt;a href="https://www.hayscountytx.gov/possible-measles-exposure-in-san-marcos" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:noted;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; Hays County Local Health Authority Dr. John Turner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As of last Friday - the state’s latest &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-21-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:update;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; - there were 90 cases reported since January. Sixteen people have been hospitalized and five of the cases were among the vaccinated. Additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area, the Department of State Health Services warned. Of those 90, 57 were in Gaines County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can survive in the air for up to two hours. People in San Antonio and San Marco who were exposed to a positive case are being asked to monitor themselves for symptoms, such as a fever and a rash (AP)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But, the outbreak is no longer just impacting Texas residents. There are now &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nine cases;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;nine cases&lt;/a&gt; reported in neighboring New Mexico’s Lea County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The majority of cases in both states are in younger people, between the ages of five and 17 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles, which can survive in the air for up to two hours, can cause serious illness and death. Infections can lead to brain swelling and blindness. And, up to nine out of 10 of those susceptible will get the virus if they have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The best way to prevent infection is two doses of a vaccine against measles. Clinics have been set up in response to the threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Individuals who have not been vaccinated are at greater risk of infection. To minimize the risk of infection and serious illness, individuals should make sure they are vaccinated,” Turner

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;There will be 3.2m new cases and 1.1m deaths a year worldwide by 2050 if current trends continue, the study found. In the UK, cases are expected to rise from 58,756 cases a year in 2022 to 71,006 cases a year in 2050. Deaths will jump from 12,122 a year in 2022 to 17,261 in 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The findings were &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03502-3" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in the journal Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Every minute, four women are diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide and one woman dies from the disease, and these statistics are worsening,” said the IARC scientist Dr Joanne Kim, one of the authors of the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Countries can mitigate or reverse these trends by adopting primary prevention policies … and by investing in early detection and treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The projected increase in cases worldwide is probably due to a mix of factors, including a growing and ageing global population, improvements in detection and diagnosis, and a higher prevalence of known risk factors for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Factors that increase the risk of breast cancer include getting older, inherited faulty genes and a family history of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Globally, most breast cancer cases and deaths occur in women aged 50 and above, who account for 71% of new cases and 79% of deaths, the IARC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;About a quarter of breast cancer cases can be prevented, the study’s authors said, for example by reducing alcohol intake, maintaining a healthy weight and becoming more active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women worldwide but its burden is not evenly distributed. The IARC said diagnosis rates were highest in Australia and New Zealand, followed by North America and northern Europe, and lowest in Asia and Africa. However, death rates were highest in Melanesia and Polynesia, and in west Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Over the last decade, incidence rates grew by 1% to 5% a year in 27 of 50 countries studied, the IARC said. Importantly, breast cancer mortality rates decreased in 29 of 46 countries analysed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Dr Isabelle Soerjomataram, the deputy head of the IARC’s cancer surveillance branch, said: “Continued progress in early diagnosis and improved access to treatment are essential to address the global gap in breast cancer and ensure that the goal of reducing suffering and death from breast cancer is achieved by all countries worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 16:08:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPLVRuWElWVG9zU1k2aG9kVnAtNE9JcVNxXzFCd2NlZlY1eHMwSXRKOGdDMWxwalRTcUhKcXd5YWxYZng1ZDhOTlVRZVFXbDVpZVZSTGhpOTdXR01xMzZuZGhlY0Q4ajZJZVZseG5zeHNEQzhHallQLXNYcWlveFZBYkgwdldsUGJydW00bE9iN3lHZlhiRHRQM3cyMmt3Yjg</guid></item><item><title>Bone erosion seen in over half of women with Sjögren’s: Study - Sjogren's Syndrome News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxPNU9McVVEYUlpTXp5WDhvZnpWVlJlcTVRR1JqS2NRNmVIdW4tUkViMmd5cU5Ka3hUanllaDhHZ0RHQVpsRlBiZ0RpUkRWNmpNWUE4Si01UVpUVFhNT1gyWkc5aWs4MkJ3eHQ4R2JycmJwVWZmU01qU1dDMlRacjdjMVkxb1BUT0IyeHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than half of women with &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/what-is-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;Sjögren’s disease&lt;/a&gt; show loss of bone tissue, or bone erosion, according to a study carried out in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Findings also showed the volume of bone erosion increased by 7% per year, and was 3.5 times higher for women who had gone through menopause. However, the presence of bone erosions or the volume of lost bone was not associated with disease activity, damage scores, or functional disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The findings of this study demonstrate a high prevalence of joint erosions in patients with [Sjögren’s disease], challenging the traditional view of [Sjögren’s] as a non-erosive disease,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0049017225000150"&gt;Associations of local bone involvement with disease activity, damage and functional disability in Sjögren’s disease: A cross-sectional study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Seminars in Arthritis and Rheumatism&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/causes-of-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;Sjögren’s disease is caused &lt;/a&gt;when the immune system mistakenly launches an inflammatory attack against the glands that produce tears and saliva, although other tissues and organs may also be affected. This leads to the hallmark &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/symptoms-of-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;Sjögren’s symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, which include of eye and mouth dryness and joint inflammation that may cause bone erosion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Observational study is 1st of its kind&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Brazil conducted an observational study to assess the relationship between bone erosions and clinical parameters of Sjögren’s using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). “This is the first study to assess joint and bone involvement in a large cohort of patients with [Sjögren’s disease] using a highly sensitive bone assessment technology,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Although joint erosions are common, they do not appear to be clinically relevant,” the researchers wrote. “Nevertheless, patients with [Sjögren’s disease] do develop these erosions, and there is likely to be an inflammatory joint component that may be associated with other factors such as age, comorbidities, or poorer disease control.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A total of 106 women with a mean age of 49.6 who had been living with Sjögren’s for a median of seven years were involved in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 100 patients who underwent high-resolution musculoskeletal ultrasound in the hands and wrists, 58% showed signs of inflammation in the joint membrane, while 20% had inflammation in the tissues that protect tendons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than half (56.7%) of the patients assessed for joint involvement had bone erosions in the joints of the fingers, with a mean volume of lost bone of 5.71 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. For reference, in a group of 60 healthy women, who had been matched for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI; a measure of body fat based on height and weight), the mean volume of lost bone was of 0.38 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some 7.2% of the patients had osteophytes, or bone spurs, in finger joints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, patients with bone erosions were significantly older and had higher levels of vitamin D than those without bone loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no differences between the two groups regarding BMI, disease duration and activity, menopause, other clinical parameters, medications used, and systemic bone involvement, including bone mineral density, structure, and strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among patients with erosions, the volume of lost bone was correlated with age, BMI, time since diagnosis, disease disability and damage scores, blood sugar levels, and the levels of a marker of bone loss called CTX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The median volume of lost bone was higher in women who had gone through menopause (8.8 mm&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;vs. 1.5 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), in those with higher damage (6.1mm&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;vs. 2.1 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), and in those with osteophytes (28mm&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;vs. 2.9 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This study shows a higher prevalence of bone erosions in [Sjögren’s disease] than previously described, particularly in older, postmenopausal women,” the researchers wrote, adding that the findings “highlight the potential of HR-pQCT as a sensitive tool to detect joint damage in [Sjögren’s disease].”&lt;/p&gt;

In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr. Tanu Gupta, physician and diabetologist, founder PeachX Health said, “In today’s fast-paced world, refined sugar is omnipresent; from breakfast cereals and bakery goods to beverages, flooding our diets in amounts far beyond our bodies’ capacity to metabolise it. This excessive sugar intake disrupts the gut microbiome, overwhelms metabolic pathways, and sets off a cascade of hormonal imbalances.” &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="manualbacklink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/anxiety-to-infertility-nutritionist-shares-8-hidden-ways-sugar-may-be-ruining-womens-health-101740050243924.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anxiety to infertility: Nutritionist shares 8 hidden ways sugar may be ruining women's health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=""&gt; &lt;span class=""&gt; &lt;picture&gt; &lt;source media="(max-width:767px)" srcset="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/02/24/550x309/sugar_1740408636321_1740408636841.jpg" alt='"Excessive sugar intake disrupts the gut microbiome, overwhelms metabolic pathways, and sets off a cascade of hormonal imbalances," said Dr Tanu Gupta.(Pexels)' title='"Excessive sugar intake disrupts the gut microbiome, overwhelms metabolic pathways, and sets off a cascade of hormonal imbalances," said Dr Tanu Gupta.(Pexels)'&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/02/24/550x309/sugar_1740408636321_1740408636841.jpg" alt='"Excessive sugar intake disrupts the gut microbiome, overwhelms metabolic pathways, and sets off a cascade of hormonal imbalances," said Dr Tanu Gupta.(Pexels)' title='"Excessive sugar intake disrupts the gut microbiome, overwhelms metabolic pathways, and sets off a cascade of hormonal imbalances," said Dr Tanu Gupta.(Pexels)'&gt; &lt;/picture&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;"Excessive sugar intake disrupts the gut microbiome, overwhelms metabolic pathways, and sets off a cascade of hormonal imbalances," said Dr Tanu Gupta.(Pexels)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p id="readMoreFTUser"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How sugar intake can affect gut health:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explaining sugar impact on our gut, Dr. Tanu Gupta said, “When we consume too much sugar, our digestive system experiences dysbiosis—a reduction in beneficial bacteria like Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus while harmful bacteria flourish. This imbalance not only impairs digestion but also weakens the gut barrier, allowing toxins and bacteria to leak into the bloodstream and trigger systemic inflammation. Chronic inflammation is a known precursor to metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.” Also read | &lt;a class="manualbacklink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/attack-on-sugar-unfair-fitness-experts-reveal-why-sugar-is-absolutely-safe-for-human-health-101717253756056.html"&gt;Attack on sugar unfair?

Elevated blood sugar forces the pancreas to produce excess insulin, which in turn disrupts the balance of sex hormones. In young women and even children, this can lead to conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), marked by irregular menstrual cycles, increased androgen levels, and early reproductive issues.” &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="manualbacklink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/diabetes-too-much-sugar-is-damaging-our-heart-liver-and-brain-a-nutritionist-explains-how-101674282493828.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diabetes: Too much sugar is damaging our heart, liver and brain; a nutritionist explains how&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Can we consume fruits in empty stomach?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although fruits are nutrient-rich, they contain natural sugars—primarily fructose—that are rapidly absorbed when eaten alone. In individuals with an already overloaded liver due to high dietary sugar, this sudden fructose influx can contribute to liver congestion. This condition, characterized by an overburdened liver struggling to detoxify and metabolize excess sugars, further compounds metabolic stress and inflammation,” the diabetologist explained.

Slow-wave sleep (SWS), the deepest stage of non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, is particularly important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;During SWS, the brain clears metabolic waste through the glymphatic system, flushing out toxins like Aβ. When SWS is disrupted, this clearance process weakens, leading to an accumulation of harmful proteins. Studies indicate that reductions in SWS are linked to increased &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/bacteria-in-your-mouth-linked-to-memory-and-dementia-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt; over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;REM sleep, known as the dream stage, is equally important but less understood in relation to Alzheimer’s. REM sleep is involved in processing emotions and storing long-term memories. Emerging evidence suggests that people who experience less REM sleep, or take longer to reach it, may be at a higher risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="delayed_rem_sleep_and_alzheimer_s_risk"&gt;Delayed REM Sleep and Alzheimer’s Risk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study conducted at the China-Japan Friendship Hospital in Beijing followed 128 participants with an average age of 70, including individuals with Alzheimer’s, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal cognition. The researchers monitored the participants’ sleep overnight, tracking brain activity, heart rate, breathing, and eye movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that those who took longer to reach REM sleep were more likely to have Alzheimer’s and had higher levels of amyloid and tau proteins. On average, individuals in the delayed REM group took over 193 minutes to reach REM sleep, while those with earlier REM sleep transitions took less than 98 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The delayed REM group showed 16% more amyloid, 29% more tau, and 39% less brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein essential for brain health.

Some medications, such as melatonin, can enhance REM sleep and have been shown in animal studies to reduce tau and amyloid buildup. Other drugs that treat insomnia by blocking chemicals that suppress REM sleep have demonstrated similar effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Future research should study the effects of certain medications that influence sleep patterns, as these may modify disease progression,” Leng said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People concerned about Alzheimer’s risk should consider improving sleep habits to enhance the transition from light sleep to REM sleep.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from McMaster University and collaborating institutions found that commonly performed interventional procedures for chronic non-cancer spine pain may provide little to no pain relief when compared with sham procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Chronic spine pain, defined as persistent pain along or referred from the spine lasting three months or longer, presents a global health challenge with significant socioeconomic implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While interventional procedures such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/epidural+steroid+injections/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;epidural steroid injections&lt;/a&gt;, nerve blocks, and radiofrequency nerve ablation are frequently used, clinical guidelines have offered conflicting recommendations regarding their effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Common interventional procedures for chronic non-cancer spine pain: a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/systematic+review/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;systematic review&lt;/a&gt; and network meta-analysis of randomized trials," &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bmj-2024-079971" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;The BMJ&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted a comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and Web of Science, for spine pain procedural outcome efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighty-one &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/trials/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt; with 7,977 patients were included in meta-analyses out of 132 eligible studies. Patients with chronic axial or radicular spine pain were randomized to receive common interventional procedures or comparators, including sham procedures and usual care. Frequentist network &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/meta-analyses/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;meta-analyses&lt;/a&gt; were performed, and the GRADE approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;For chronic axial spine pain, moderate certainty evidence showed that epidural injection of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/local+anesthetic/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;local anesthetic&lt;/a&gt;, epidural injection of local anesthetic and steroids, and joint-targeted steroid injection, result in little to no difference in pain relief compared with sham procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low certainty evidence suggests minimal pain relief differences for intramuscular and joint-targeted injections of local anesthetic, with or without steroids. Intramuscular injection of local anesthetic with steroids signaled that it may actually increase pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For chronic radicular &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/spine/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;spine&lt;/a&gt; pain, moderate certainty evidence indicates that epidural injection of local anesthetic and steroids and radiofrequency of the dorsal root ganglion are unlikely to result in pain relief. Low certainty evidence suggests epidural injections of local anesthetic or steroids may also yield minimal pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In physical functioning, moderate certainty evidence shows joint-targeted injections and epidural injections with local anesthetic or steroids probably provide little to no improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low certainty evidence suggests certain procedures may slightly increase the risk of non-serious adverse events, including joint radiofrequency ablation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking at the substantial cost, inconvenience, and false hope of these common procedures compared to data that suggests they are ineffective, it is unclear why they have persisted. If the study results are valid, another issue suggested is a major communication disconnect regarding procedures and patient outcomes in health care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined immune responses against more than 23,000 human proteins, and the MLC1 protein emerged as one of the top hit proteins targeted by immune B-cells derived from MS patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/NXI.0000000000200374"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Modulator of VRAC Current 1 Is a Potential Target Antigen in Multiple Sclerosis,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” was published in &lt;em&gt;Neurology Neuroimmunology and Neuroinflammation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/risk-factors-for-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;MS is caused&lt;/a&gt; by inflammation that damages nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. While the mechanisms that drive that inflammation in MS aren’t fully understood, B-cells appear to play a major role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B-cells are a type of immune cell that produce antibodies, that is, proteins that attack specific molecular targets, known as antigens. While antibodies are essential for fighting infections and other threats, in MS, it’s believed that certain antibodies mistakenly attack antigens from healthy brain cells, triggering an erroneous immune response against those cells and causing nerve damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some proteins have been &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2023/10/18/ectrims-2023-new-research-may-explain-link-ebv-ms-development/"&gt;identified as possible antigens&lt;/a&gt; in MS, including the brain protein GlialCAM, there doesn’t seem to be one single target antigen for all cases of MS. Pinning down other antigens that may be targeted in MS might lead to more effective therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The target antigen of MS has long been a mystery and there seems to be no defined single target antigen,” Stefanie Kürten, PhD, co-author of the study at University Hospital Bonn in Germany, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.uni-bonn.de/en/news/031-2025"&gt;university news story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;A role for MLC1 in MS?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, researchers collected B-cells from 20 MS patients and nine people without the disease, then exposed the cells to more than 23,000 different human proteins. B-cells from MS patients had heightened antibody responses to a variety of proteins, results showed, but the protein MLC1 caught the researchers’ eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MLC1 (short for modulator of VRAC current 1) is found in nerve cells and astrocytes, or star-shaped cells that support nerve function. It’s known to physically interact with GlialCAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[MLC1] is a very interesting candidate because the protein is expressed on astrocytes and neurons. MLC1 is also a binding partner of GlialCAM,” said Alicia Weier, a doctoral student at the University of Bonn and co-first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyses of samples from separate subsets of people with or without MS confirmed the original findings, suggesting B-cells from MS patients are more reactive to MLC1 than B-cells from people without the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MS patients had higher levels of anti-MLC1 antibodies in their blood and in the fluid around their brains. Antibodies against MLC1 also were elevated in samples from people with other inflammatory neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a final set of tests, the researchers injected anti-MLC1 antibodies into mice with MS-like disease. The antibodies were found to bind strongly to cerebral cortical neurons, nerve cells in the brain’s outermost part. Also, four of the seven mice given anti-MLC1 antibodies died less than a day after being injected, whereas all the mice that weren’t given the antibodies survived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data suggest “anti-MLC1 antibodies played a role in aggravating disease severity,” wrote the researchers, who emphasized that more studies are needed to further explore the potential role of anti-MLC1 antibodies in MS. “Further experiments with a larger sample size will have to be performed to verify the findings regarding the [disease-causing ability] of MLC1-specific antibodies.”&lt;/p&gt;

                                    &lt;ul class="summary-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stacy Anderson, a scientist, has studied how centenarians live for over 20 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She believes lifestyle factors such as diet play a big role in how long a person might live.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She eats plenty of fruits and vegetables and gets eight hours of sleep each night.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A scientist who has studied centenarians for over 20 years shared four things she does to live a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/eating-more-protein-help-women-healthy-aging-positive-impact-2024-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;long, healthy life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stacy Andersen, a behavioral neuroscientist at Boston University Chobanian and Avedisian School of Medicine, is the co-director of the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/doctor-made-longevity-calculator-estimates-how-long-you-will-live-2023-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;New England Centenarian Study&lt;/a&gt;, which examines the lives of people over 100 who are in good health. She has traveled the country visiting centenarians in their homes, meeting their families, and often sitting down with them for breakfast to try to pinpoint why they have lived so long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not trying to get everyone to live to 100. We're trying to get everyone to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-eat-live-100-worlds-oldest-people-diet-tips-centenarians-2024-12" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;live like a centenarian&lt;/a&gt;. So really, to have that extended healthspan," Andersen told Business Insider, using the term for how long a person is healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living to an extreme age, like 105 and over, is likely about 70% down to a person's genetics, Andersen said, but &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-lifestyle-changes-live-longer-healthy-habits-genes-study-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;healthy habits&lt;/a&gt; appear to be the most important factor for living to our late 80s and early 90s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no one recipe for longevity, Andersen said, but following "the good, healthy behaviors that we know about and that are well tested" is the best approach to healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She shared the habits she's implemented into her life based on her research and meeting hundreds of centenarians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="c4356f32-1655-493a-ab94-8068b1b41377" data-toc-id="c4356f32-1655-493a-ab94-8068b1b41377"&gt;1) Eat five different colors a day&lt;/h2&gt;

                          &lt;p&gt;Andersen tries to eat five different colors of fruits and vegetables every day to ensure she gets a range of nutrients. "You're getting a wider variety, and it just feels good to check that box each day," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
                          
                          
                          
                                 
                          &lt;p&gt;Prioritizing fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and lean meats is crucial for healthy aging, she said and pointed to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/mediterranean-diet" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;Mediterranean-style diet&lt;/a&gt; as an example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the eating patterns of people in countries like Italy, Greece, and Turkey, the Mediterranean Diet has been ranked&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mediterranean-diet-best-healthy-eating-longevity-rankings-2025-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt; the healthiest way to eat&lt;/a&gt; for eight years running by US News &amp;amp; World Report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large 2023 study found that people who ate a whole-food-rich diet, similar to the Mediterranean Diet, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/foods-live-10-years-longer-longevity-diet-study-2023-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;lived up to a decade longer&lt;/a&gt; than those who ate a typical Western diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="af27d73a-0543-4c9e-ad67-2e19822f7390" data-toc-id="af27d73a-0543-4c9e-ad67-2e19822f7390"&gt;2) Exercise daily and mix it up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anderson aims to get some movement in every day. She mixes up her workouts, sometimes going on long hikes with her dog, and other times running on a treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typical centenarian is active, Andersen said. Many live on their own into their 90s, they often drive for an average of 10 years longer than their peers, and work for five years longer, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common workout the centenarians she has studied do is walking or stretching, but they also do a lot of informal exercise, such as housekeeping, gardening, and yard work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between longevity and an active lifestyle is well-established. A 2023 study by researchers at the University of Cambridge found a link between exercising for &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/short-walk-a-day-could-reduce-risk-early-death-study-2023-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;11 minutes a day&lt;/a&gt; and a lower risk of dying from chronic illnesses such as heart disease and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="6d928ae2-2729-44d2-85ae-e4ef4bf8c5bc" data-toc-id="6d928ae2-2729-44d2-85ae-e4ef4bf8c5bc"&gt;3) Get good-quality sleep&lt;/h2&gt;

                            &lt;/figure&gt;
                          &lt;p&gt;Andersen prioritizes consistently getting eight hours of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-improve-longevity-supplements-vs-exercise-and-diet-2024-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;high-quality sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current guidance on sleep tends to emphasize getting seven to nine hours, but some &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/47/1/zsad253/7280269?login=false" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"&gt;emerging science &lt;/a&gt;suggests sticking to a consistent sleep schedule could matter more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone is different and feeling refreshed when you wake up is more important than the number of hours you sleep, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's kind of when you feel like you're waking up ready to start the day," Andersen added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we sleep, it's like a "power cleanse for our brain," she said. It helps remove the proteins that are thought to to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="af7ed46a-a796-43f5-aed1-23285a62abb7" data-toc-id="af7ed46a-a796-43f5-aed1-23285a62abb7"&gt;4) Challenge yourself to learn a new skill&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andersen has taken up sailing, which she said challenges her both cognitively and physically. "I tell everyone, 'Whatever you've always wanted to do that's new, go and do that!'" she said. Several centenarians she has met took up painting in their later years, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing something that engages your brain and attention strengthens neural pathways and builds new ones, and is the number one thing we can do for brain health, she said. "Just doing crossword puzzles where you're retrieving information is probably not going to be that beneficial," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0153485" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal PLOS One by researchers at the University of Edinburgh, found that after just one week of intensive language learning, a group of 33 participants, aged between 18 and 78, had improved their ability to focus and switch between tasks. A control group of 34 participants who did an intensive course that didn't involve language learning also experienced cognitive benefits, but they weren't quite as significant, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;

Think of it like a stopwatch that measures how your body is aging internally, not just counting the years.” &lt;br&gt;— Austin Argentieri, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Nature" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03164-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;previous publication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, we built a proteomic aging clock by taking proteins in the blood and using machine learning to estimate (a) participant’s biological age. We showed that this proteomic aging clock is a powerful predictor of mortality and disease multimorbidity — it is a single measure associated with future risk of 18 major chronic diseases,” Argentieri explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We used the proteomic aging clock in this current paper because we wanted to identify exposures that are important for aging, and so we decided that we would only select exposures that were associated with both mortality and the proteomic age clock in consistent directions,” he continued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If an exposure was associated with mortality and the proteomic clock in different directions … then we would have excluded that exposure because it is implausible that an exposure could both increase risk of mortality but slow down aging (or vice versa). So in essence we used the proteomic aging clock to get a better sense of biological plausibility for each of the mortality-associated exposures,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the study’s conclusion, Argentieri and his team identified 25 lifestyle and environmental factors — 23 that they reported are modifiable — that were associated with mortality and proteomic aging, as well as aging biomarkers and major disease risk factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/299147" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Cheese consumption&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ease of &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-to-tan-safely" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;skin tanning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Education years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Employment status&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ethnicity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frequency of feeling tired&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gym use&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;History of financial difficulties&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Household income&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Physical activity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/sleep-calculator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Sleeping hours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smoking status&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Type of housing (i.e. house, apartment, mobile home, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using an open fire for heating&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weight and height at 10 years old&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers found that smoking, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and living conditions were the factors that had the most influence on mortality and biological aging. Smoking alone was associated with 21 diseases, and socioeconomic factors and tiredness frequency with 19 diseases.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This means that a few fundamental aspects of our environments and lives could possibly have a profound influence on whether we live a long healthy life. In a time when there is lots of attention paid to fancy new trends in wellness, it reminds us that getting back to basics will still possibly have the largest and most strategic impact on improving population health,” Argentieri explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, researchers attributed 17% of the variation in risk of death to environmental factors, compared to less than 2% explained by genetic predisposition for 22 major diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists also found that environmental exposures had a greater effect on lung, heart, and liver diseases, while genetic risk still dominated for &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/142214" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;dementias&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/37136" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This [d]emonstrates that our environments and lifestyle are almost 10 times more important in explaining mortality risk than our genetic predisposition for major diseases causes of death. It means that we have the power to have a major impact on preventing early mortality if we focus on improving our environmental and economic conditions.”&lt;br&gt;— Austin Argentieri, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research should give us all hope that aging is not fully predetermined in our genes, but it is something that is shaped in our environments. This means that we have the power to take our own health in our hands preventatively through not just changes to lifestyle but also through policy and intervention efforts aimed at reducing our exposures to harmful environments,” Argentieri said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; had the chance to speak with &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a board certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA, about this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This population-based study found that environmental factors — such as physical inactivity and socioeconomic factors — play a much bigger role than genetic factors in the development of disease and early death. These findings reinforce what we understand about the significant health implications of many harmful environmental exposures such as smoking.” &lt;br&gt;— Cheng-Han Chen, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As most of the identified lifestyle and environmental factors are considered to (be) modifiable, there is a tremendous opportunity to reduce the global burden of disease by addressing and ameliorating these risk factors,” Chen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The environmental factors in this study explained only about 17% of the variation in the risk of death. There are clearly many more as-yet-unidentified risks to be addressed. Future research could utilize these study’s techniques to investigate other possible environmental risk factors (such as chemical exposures) for their contribution to disease,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also talked to &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/wael-harb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Wael Harb, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a board certified hematologist and medical oncologist at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this research. He said quantifying the extent to which modifiable factors impact biological aging and premature mortality underscores the importance of preventive strategies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study provides compelling evidence supporting the long-held understanding that lifestyle and environmental factors play a crucial role in determining health outcomes, often outweighing genetic predispositions. The finding that environmental exposures account for 17% of mortality risk compared to less than 2% from genetics is particularly striking and highlights the significant potential for public health interventions.” &lt;br&gt;— Wael Harb, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The next logical step would be to dive deeper into the specific mechanisms by which key environmental factors accelerate aging and contribute to disease. Longitudinal studies focusing on intervention strategies — such as &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/smoking-cessation-aids" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;smoking cessation&lt;/a&gt; programs, physical activity promotion, and improvements in socioeconomic conditions — would help validate whether modifying these exposures can indeed slow biological aging and reduce premature mortality,” Harb said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, integrating multi-omics data — genomics, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8473418/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;proteomics&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/metabolomics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;metabolomics&lt;/a&gt; — could offer a more comprehensive view of how environmental and genetic factors interplay, leading to more personalized approaches to preventive care,” he added. “It would also be valuable to replicate these findings in diverse populations to ensure the conclusions are broadly applicable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 14:38:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixAFBVV95cUxNalJfUnlYVDYtQTFja0UxNF9rX2s5S0dhWGdlOU9GSmJ6aXhvcEdGRG1DMHFMX0VzYnhpMFk5b01DQmxkNTJDVXpGUm5KVWVtZnBaX3RIWXBZNkdSbkJVZG1nV2RnY0l1eFlJOUd6dFRsNVV6Ujhnd25RYzNBNTJmNi13NGZBT284bTA3V3gxRFd6SjAtdDZvS0p4SllMVGNrenpOUEhQN0NLeGYwb2dmeHd5dUJMZFJYY1dUREl5M1NCaTNu</guid></item><item><title>Heart disease remains the top cause of death in the U.S. - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxNWDdCWHhsZkdrLWlscE5KLVRvVDlydC1rVTh5Q3VnRmxzRjdLY0ZVN3RRc0hNam00Tmhmd1pMUnA1VTVKSGNrVWZOMGlEeVdkRGNSRUxzaXRHNHRwT3Y1RVV1OXJtRXZLeVRYaVRfM1B5SDFabkhZdXlQYXFmY3N4VXotNVJwQlFxRGtyTW9GN1AwdTlaYVVB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3CLG25UBSJGZ3AZPWBLK3NMNKE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Cardiovascular disease remains&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the leading cause of death in the United States and accounted for 941,652 deaths in 2022, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/-/media/PHD-Files-2/Science-News/2/2025-Heart-and-Stroke-Stat-Update/2025-Statistics-At-A-Glance.pdf?sc_lang=en" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published by the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NQNDS55LIZFYZI5YR4DG27QHZA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the United States in 2022, heart disease and stroke killed more people than all forms of cancer and accidental deaths.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you were at Osaka’s major international airport earlier this month, you’ll want to keep an eye on your physical condition for the next few weeks&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-692068"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On February 14, a resident of Aichi Prefecture began to feel hot. Unfortunately, this was not the result of romantic feelings swelling inside the woman because it was Valentine’s Day, but the onset of measles symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to a fever, the woman eventually developed a rash, cough, and intestinal inflammation, leading to a medical examination in which her &lt;strong&gt;measles infection was confirmed and announced by the Osaka Prefectural government on February 21&lt;/strong&gt;. The woman, who is in her 20s and had received measles vaccinations twice at some point in her life, is now hospitalized and undergoing recovery treatment, but what makes the situation still concerning is that &lt;strong&gt;prior to her diagnosis she appears to have traveled overseas via Kansai Airport, one of Japan’s largest international air hubs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&lt;strong&gt;n February 14, the woman took an airline-operated highway bus from Nagoya Staton in Aichi to Kansai Airport&lt;/strong&gt;, departing at around noon and arriving at approximately 3:30 p.m. She then spent the next two and a half hours inside the airport’s&lt;strong&gt; Terminal 1&lt;/strong&gt;, which is used for both domestic and international flights. The infection announcement states that the woman “had traveled to Vietnam” prior to her diagnosis, which would account for why &lt;strong&gt;she was back in Kansai Airport’s Terminal 1 a week later on February 21&lt;/strong&gt;, from about 4 to 6 in the evening. She then traveled to the &lt;strong&gt;Hatago Inn Kansai Airport&lt;/strong&gt;, a hotel in Izumisano City just across the water from the island which makes up the airport, where she stayed at the hotel from about 10:30 p.m. until noon the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;Osaka Prefecture’s second confirmed case of measles infection this year&lt;/strong&gt;, with the other, seemingly by coincidence, also announced on February 21. In an apparently unrelated case, a girl (whose age has been given as “under 10 years old”) was diagnosed with measles after developing a fever, cough, and rash. The child has no history of measles vaccination, and contact tracing efforts determined she was at the Lalaport Kadoma/Mitsui Outler Park Osaka Kadoma shopping center in Kadoma City on the evening of February 15 for roughly 40 minutes from about 5 p.m., and at the Hanaten branch of drugstore Matsumoto Kiyoshi in Osaka City on February 17 from approximately 6:10 to 6:50 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After infection, it can take as much as three weeks for measles symptoms to show&lt;/strong&gt;, so health officials are urging anyone who happened be travelling through Kansai Airport or staying or shopping at the other above-mentioned locations on the specified dates to pay close attention to their physical condition over the next few weeks and consult a doctor if they begin to feel feverish or develop a cough or rash.&lt;/p&gt;

Developed by Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.bps.org.uk/psychologist/rorschach-test-100" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;in 1921&lt;/a&gt;, the test involves showing a number of inkblots to subjects, then asking them to say what they see. The images are deliberately inscrutable and open to interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;For decades they were popular among psychologists as a way of understanding a person's psyche from the creatures, objects or scenes they perceive in the shapes. It relies upon a phenomenon known as pareidolia, which is a tendency to find meaningful interpretations in things where there is none. It is the same reason why people see faces or animals in cloud formations or on the surface of the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;You might see a butterfly in the image while someone else might see a skull. According to proponents of the test, both interpretations shed light on how you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"When a person interprets a Rorschach image, they unconsciously project elements of their psyche such as fears, desires, and cognitive biases," says Barbara Santini, a London-based psychologist, who uses the Rorschach test with her clients. "The test works because human vision isn't passive, but a meaning-making process shaped by personal experience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;But what happens if you have no personal experience, or you offer it to a "brain" that works in an entirely different way? What might an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm recognise in these inkblots? And what would their answers tell us about the human mind?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kt8qh1.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kt8qh1.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kt8qh1.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kt8qh1.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kt8qh1.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kt8qh1.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kt8qh1.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kt8qh1.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kt8qh1.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kt8qh1.jpg.webp" alt="Estudio Santa Rita Rorschach inkblots take advantage of a phenomenon known as pareidolia (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 fxQYxK"&gt;Estudio Santa Rita&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw"&gt;Rorschach inkblots take advantage of a phenomenon known as pareidolia (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;&lt;span id="bat-or-moth?" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="bat-or-moth?" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;Bat or moth?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Recent developments in the capabilities of AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT means it's now possible to put that to the test.

With some expert help, each article pits different AI tools against the human mind, asking probing questions designed to test the limits of intelligence. Can a machine write a better joke than a professional comedian, or unpick a moral conundrum more elegantly than a philosopher?

"It is designed to be ambiguous so that each person might see something different depending on their experiences, emotions, and imagination."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Pretence spoiled, it then went on to explain what it saw in the same answer, without me having to prompt it further. "For me, it resembles something symmetrical, possibly two animals or figures facing each other, or a single entity with wings outstretched," the chatbot responded. "The beauty of these inkblots is that they invite individual interpretations!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The chatbot then asked me back what I saw in the image – a question I chose to ignore, instead pressing it to see which of the two resemblances it had suggested it thought was most fitting. "Looking closely, I'd say it most resembles a single entity with wings outstretched – perhaps a bat or a moth, with its wings open symmetrically," the chatbot wrote. "The central area could be interpreted as the body, and the details on the sides evoke the texture or shape of wings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"I think that's just rehearsing what it knows of the specific test," says Coen Dekker, a Dutch software developer &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://coendekker.nl/media/pdf/Performing-the-Rorschach-test-with-a-neural-network-v3.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;who a decade ago asked&lt;/a&gt; a neural network, an early version of the technology underpinning AI chatbots today, to complete a Rorschach test. (Dekker's experiment was significantly more simplified because of the technical constraints of the neural networks of the time.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 bBAxiJ"&gt;If an AI's response resembles a human's, it's not because it sees the same thing but it's because its training data mirrors our collective visual culture – Barbara Santini&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"I believe it mainly identifies patterns, shapes, and textures within the blots, and then compares these features to a vast dataset of human responses to generate its interpretation of what it sees in the inkblots," says Ieva Kubiliute, a London-based psychologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;&lt;span id="the-essence-of-humanity" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="the-essence-of-humanity" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;The essence of humanity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"ChatGPT provides interesting, human-like responses, but it is likely not genuinely thinking – instead, it appears to be scanning an online dataset," says Chandril Ghosh, lecturer in psychology at the University of Kent, in the UK, specialising in mental health, AI and treatment. It's similar to the way a musician who has never experienced heartbreak can still write a song that pulls at your heartstrings, simply by analysing how other similar songs like it are structured. Or as Santini, the psychologist puts it, "If an AI's response resembles a human's, it's not because it sees the same thing but it's because its training data mirrors our collective visual culture."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;What we get is a facsimile of reality – and of thought. "ChatGPT can accurately describe emotions without actually experiencing them," Ghosh says. That doesn't make AI useless when it comes to matters of the mind, however. "ChatGPT can understand emotions, describe them, and help others make sense of their feelings," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Ghosh believes that ChatGPT is simply regurgitating random information from its dataset for the benefit of users – which gives the impression of "thinking", but never actually is. Part of the reason why we perceive it possibly as thinking is the way that the tech companies behind these AI chatbots present their products. ChatGPT and tools like it are always helpful, always conscientious, and always conversational. The anthropomorphising of these tools has helped their adoption – but it can muddy the waters around how they – and their outputs – are perceived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kt8ql6.jpg.webp" alt='Estudio Santa Rita The images that an AI "sees" in an inkblot is merely a reflection of the data it has been trained upon (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita)' class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 fxQYxK"&gt;Estudio Santa Rita&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw"&gt;The images that an AI "sees" in an inkblot is merely a reflection of the data it has been trained upon (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;One way of uncovering that unreality is by simply pressing the refresh button, says Ghosh.

They trained an AI algorithm called "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/norman/overview/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;Norman&lt;/a&gt;" – named after Alfred Hitchcock's character Norman Bates – on images from a Reddit group that shares images of people dying in gruesome circumstances. When they showed Norman a set of Rorschach inkblots, the images it described seeing reflected the darkness it had been trained upon. While an algorithm trained on a more normal set of image data would see a group of birds on a tree branch, Norman &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44040008" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;described seeing a man being electrocuted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;It is a stark illustration of just how important the data used to train an AI can be.

"It has a general understanding of colour theory and what emotional responses these could give when analysed," says Dekker. "I have a feeling it has a general understanding of the images and what people associate it with. This got me thinking: Wouldn't it be cool if we had – or created – a new set of Rorschach-like images which the model does not know about at all, and let it analyse those?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;While this isn't something Dekker is actively pursuing, we know that AI algorithms do have a tendency to "hallucinate" and invent information that isn't true. But it is also possible force them to hallucinate too. In one experiment by computer scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, US, they were able to 3D print a turtle with a particular colour and texture that fooled &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/athalye18b.html" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;a machine vision system into thinking it was a rifle&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, a &lt;a target="_self" href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170410-how-to-fool-artificial-intelligence" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;few stickers on a stop sign&lt;/a&gt; can render it invisible to the algorithm – a potential risk for a self-driving car.

There was no subjectivity in what the AI system was saying when presented with the inkblots, Kubiliute says. "It cannot understand the symbolic meaning or emotional resonance that a human might associate with a particular image."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;And that in itself tells us a lot about the human mind. "The human psyche is filled with internal conflicts, such as the tension between desires and morals or fears and ambitions," says Ghosh. "In contrast, AI functions on clear logic and does not struggle with inner dilemmas essential to human thought and decision-making."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;&lt;b id="facebook" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;&lt;b id="x" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b id="" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;&lt;b id="instagram" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b id="." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPSGRHcEtZV0VoZE5vSFZPZkVoMVFVWVNLanplWm1mdFRsYUtNbjFlNDNmS1FPejI5UHJrbnVsMjF3VzFlcGJySjFBTjJaSkl5djY0R0VjbFlYN253UEtmQ0xmQnhab0xORC1oR3BrcF83c3lKZ2RqNzFENUtmVENvc3ZQTlhZY2lGeDhVN0x0WGN4Y1hOWmNMaXI2Z2NmdlFXUHNr</guid></item><item><title>Answers to your questions on carbohydrates, cholesterol and fish - The Seattle Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOQkRjT2VtOU9pdzVubzR0SFd3N3pweXM1TUFOYlpYZHIzQXBhcjI0aGpkWkU2RThHTUU3eFRrMHgwMTgyZGpRUjV1WGM3ZU5FcHNHMEtySlYyaEVWdGdEZzJVazJWenpGZGl1OG1FUEhhWm1xOFQ2ZldfVFZzZmNaSk1PYWpLbmIwUGRxaDJCODAyY1N0a29RVm5WZnJvbWtoTG4zdXBOdUdpQVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOQkRjT2VtOU9pdzVubzR0SFd3N3pweXM1TUFOYlpYZHIzQXBhcjI0aGpkWkU2RThHTUU3eFRrMHgwMTgyZGpRUjV1WGM3ZU5FcHNHMEtySlYyaEVWdGdEZzJVazJWenpGZGl1OG1FUEhhWm1xOFQ2ZldfVFZzZmNaSk1PYWpLbmIwUGRxaDJCODAyY1N0a29RVm5WZnJvbWtoTG4zdXBOdUdpQVE?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Answers to your questions on carbohydrates, cholesterol and fish&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOQkRjT2VtOU9pdzVubzR0SFd3N3pweXM1TUFOYlpYZHIzQXBhcjI0aGpkWkU2RThHTUU3eFRrMHgwMTgyZGpRUjV1WGM3ZU5FcHNHMEtySlYyaEVWdGdEZzJVazJWenpGZGl1OG1FUEhhWm1xOFQ2ZldfVFZzZmNaSk1PYWpLbmIwUGRxaDJCODAyY1N0a29RVm5WZnJvbWtoTG4zdXBOdUdpQVE</guid></item><item><title>Half of Americans Still Believe This Dangerous Aspirin Myth - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxNN1lSYmZXbS1xdXE2VGFTS1l2elNOM3h4d1I4cWFHT25jNTdCSzkxaWl1QnV6eVR3MFVTSUE1MEdZX1BLa09SVzZyNWRxNFBlWVVRaHZaYUE0dU1sOWtkY09WeWgtV2V6UHpHTzM1eF81WHNIOW1qdURmNG9lTVY2ai1qelRlN0diNVhrMXVB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 13:46:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxNN1lSYmZXbS1xdXE2VGFTS1l2elNOM3h4d1I4cWFHT25jNTdCSzkxaWl1QnV6eVR3MFVTSUE1MEdZX1BLa09SVzZyNWRxNFBlWVVRaHZaYUE0dU1sOWtkY09WeWgtV2V6UHpHTzM1eF81WHNIOW1qdURmNG9lTVY2ai1qelRlN0diNVhrMXVB</guid></item><item><title>A Doctor Claimed He Knew Why I Got Cancer.

The show captures the exhaustion and desperation many cancer patients feel, and the seductive allure of ditching traditional medicine for the promise of a “natural” cure. It also exposes the dark underbelly of the alternative health industry — a world where quacks and influencers prey on the vulnerable. They speak with unwavering confidence, yet their claims are backed by zero peer-reviewed evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know this all too well ... because I almost fell for it myself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer in December 2022. I immediately began scheduling consultations with surgeons, but most appointments were pushed to mid- or late January because of the holidays. With weeks to wait, I decided to use the time proactively — or so I thought — and met with Dr. T, an integrative medical doctor, to explore if supplements could support my health while I waited for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Dr. T fully backed my decision to pursue surgery, she mentioned another holistic practitioner, Dr. D, who specialized in &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/breast-cancer/thermography" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="thermography" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b764e2e4b050f805a184b9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.healthline.com/health/breast-cancer/thermography" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;thermography&lt;/a&gt;. She explained that thermography — a thermal imaging technique that maps blood flow on the breast’s surface — potentially can identify areas of abnormal heat linked to inflammation or tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;What caught my attention, though, was her offhand remark that Dr. D had allegedly “healed” a breast cancer patient without surgery, radiation or chemotherapy. As a science writer curious about holistic medicine, I was intrigued. Could thermography detect my cancer? I decided to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author shortly before breast-conserving surgery at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I arrived at Dr. D’s office, I noticed that it felt more like a spa than a medical clinic — a welcome change from the windowless rooms with fluorescent lighting where I’d gotten my breast screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thermogram process involved nine thermal images taken with a special camera, followed by a “cold challenge” where I submerged my hands in icy water to test how my body responded. I was told that healthy tissue cools in sync with the brain’s signals, while cancerous or inflamed areas resist the change and show up as hot spots on the thermogram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was fascinated, but I couldn’t ignore the red flags: thermograms &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issues-warning-letter-clinic-illegally-marketing-unapproved-thermography-device-warns-consumers" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="aren’t FDA approved " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b764e2e4b050f805a184b9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issues-warning-letter-clinic-illegally-marketing-unapproved-thermography-device-warns-consumers" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;aren’t FDA approved &lt;/a&gt;as standalone tests for detecting breast cancer, and the technician operating the machine turned out to be the doctor’s wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;After waiting for 30 minutes for my results — an eternity that left me uneasy — Dr. D finally called me into his office. And then, things took a bizarre turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, he showed me the rainbow-colored thermogram report and acknowledged that it hadn’t detected my cancer — in fact, he seemed visibly flustered by the imaging fail. Instead, it had only revealed “extra heat” in the area, putting me in the “high-risk” category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, he revealed his theory: My cancer was caused by “too many COVID vaccines,” and I shouldn’t get another. I was too stunned to respond. Not only is there zero evidence linking COVID vaccines to breast cancer or other “&lt;a href="https://www.contagionlive.com/view/mrna-covid-19-vaccines-and-turbo-cancer-the-latest-myth-that-won-t-disappear" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="turbo cancers" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b764e2e4b050f805a184b9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.contagionlive.com/view/mrna-covid-19-vaccines-and-turbo-cancer-the-latest-myth-that-won-t-disappear" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;turbo cancers&lt;/a&gt;,” the claim flew in the face of my personal history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What about the fact that my mom had the same type of cancer, in the same breast, at the same age?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He dismissed this outright. “No, it’s definitely the vaccines,” he insisted, before pivoting to his next pitch: Super Mineral Water, a product he sold in his clinic, which he claimed could “detox” my body and possibly help cure me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;By then, I was equally horrified and embarrassed — not just by his quackery, but by my naiveté for walking into this mess. I grabbed my things and left as quickly as I could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author ringing a bell after finishing a month of radiation treatment at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;After my experience, I turned to the internet and stumbled on some comment boards about thermograms. One post led me to the story of &lt;a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/story/breast-cancer-survivor-shares-cautionary-tale-relying-solely-60728490" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Morganne Delian" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b764e2e4b050f805a184b9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/story/breast-cancer-survivor-shares-cautionary-tale-relying-solely-60728490" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Morganne Delian&lt;/a&gt;, a believer in homeopathic medicine who opted for a thermogram instead of a mammogram to detect cancer when she felt a lump in her breast. The thermogram practitioner reportedly told Delian that he couldn’t see a lump but warned she had “mild to moderate risk of developing aggressive breast tissue.” Months later, after finally undergoing a mammogram and a biopsy, she was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stories like Delian’s are chilling reminders of the potential dangers posed by unproven screening tools and alternative therapies.

Part of it, I think, is the allure of control in a moment when you feel paralyzed with terror. A cancer diagnosis strips you of your agency — your body feels like a traitor and your treatment plan is dictated by a team of experts that you’ve just met. Alternative medicine offers the illusion of empowerment and personalized care. Quacks don’t bog you down with statistics, side effects or limitations — they offer hope and simplicity. In a world where cancer treatments are scary or difficult to understand, that simplicity and hope can become irresistible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;After my diagnosis, one of the best things I did was learn to trust my cancer team and the science that guided them. I abandoned my wishful thinking — the fantasy of the “lovely healing experience,” like Milla’s tropical Hirsch retreat in “Apple Cider Vinegar.” Instead, I embraced the stark reality of white hospital walls and a windowless operating room, where my surgeon skillfully removed my tumor and left me cancer free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author and her husband at the D.C.

If that remained true, the virus would not change much to become more dangerous soon, and any vaccine could provide &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/30/science/coronavirus-mutations.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:years of durable protection;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;years of durable protection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What actually happened was that SARS-CoV-2 began mutating quickly, first to be &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/12/virus-mutation-catastrophe/617531/?utm_source=yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:more transmissible;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;more transmissible&lt;/a&gt; and then to evade our immunity, causing breakthrough infections and reinfections. Five years and &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/04/covid-variant-naming-omicron-ba2/629558/?utm_source=yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:an alphanumeric soup of variants;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;an alphanumeric soup of variants&lt;/a&gt; later, most of us have gotten COVID at least once. The vaccine is still being updated to match new circulating variants. And the virus itself is still changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In truth, scientists were both right and wrong about the speed at which SARS-CoV-2 mutates. The rate of mutations as this virus jumps from person to person is indeed unimpressive. But scientists were not aware of a second, accelerated evolutionary track: When SARS-CoV-2 infects a single immunocompromised patient, it can persist for months, accumulating countless mutations in that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And if we are unlucky, that highly mutated virus might spread to others. This is the likely origin of Omicron, which appeared in fall 2021 with more than &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/01/coronavirus-variant-after-omicro/621404/?utm_source=yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:50 mutations;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;50 mutations&lt;/a&gt;—an astounding evolutionary leap. Omicron looked like it had achieved four or five years’ worth of expected evolution in just months, Jesse Bloom, who studies viral evolution at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/12/omicron-spread-infection-severity/620948/?utm_source=yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:told me at the time;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;told me at the time&lt;/a&gt;. These mutations enabled Omicron to cause a massive wave of infections even among the vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Scientists now believe that chronic infections in immunocompromised patients are a key driver of variants in Omicron and beyond. Even as COVID surveillance has faded in urgency, researchers are watching chronic infections for signs of what’s to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="my-4"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In retrospect, clues were there from the beginning. At the start of the pandemic, researchers in New York, including Harm van Bakel, a geneticist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, began sequencing viruses from &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2031670" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cancer patients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;cancer patients&lt;/a&gt; who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in March and April 2020—and then kept testing positive for up to two months. The patients couldn’t clear the virus because their immune systems had been weakened by disease and by cancer treatments they received. The study, published in December 2020, concluded that immunocompromised patients with COVID might need long isolation periods, lest they unwittingly spread the virus. (These chronic infections in people who are immunocompromised are distinct from long COVID, which doesn’t necessarily involve continual shedding of virus.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That same month, a &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.05.20241927v3.full.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:preprint;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt; from a group led by Ravindra Gupta in the U.K. connected more of the dots. Gupta and his colleagues had found an immunocompromised patient with a lingering infection who was treated with &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/03/plasma-blood-covid-19-survivors/609007/?utm_source=yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:antibodies from COVID survivors;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;antibodies from COVID survivors&lt;/a&gt;, only for the virus to acquire curious new mutations. Two mutations in particular gave the virus a slight edge in infectivity and antibody evasion. An immunocompromised host, the authors suggested, could provide the ideal viral training ground: A weakened immune system cannot wipe out the virus but can put up just enough defense for the virus to learn its tricks. In this case, the infused antibodies from COVID survivors likely contributed to whatever defenses the patient himself had, but even together they were not enough to completely clear the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The virus from that particular patient probably didn’t spread far, if at all; most do not. But countless chronic infections all around the world subjecting the virus to similar immune defenses could ultimately lead to the same battle-tested mutations showing up over and over again. Indeed, mutations similar to the two in the U.K. patient soon showed up in variants such as Alpha and Omicron that did sweep around the world, Gupta told me recently. And in 2021, multiple alarming variants were found to have a different mutation that researchers in New York first observed in immunocompromised patients way back at the beginning of the pandemic. (Researchers at Mount Sinai, led by van Bakel and Viviana Simon, did match a minor variant from an immunocompromised patient &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10239218/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:to other infections in the New York City area;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;to other infections in the New York City area&lt;/a&gt;, though it didn’t seem to spread much beyond that.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;None of the more notorious COVID variants has been directly traced to a single immunocompromised patient. But indirect evidence has accumulated over time that many variants do develop this way. Chronic infections, scientists have now observed over and over, create a distinct pattern of mutations: an overabundance of changes in the spike protein (which helps penetrate human cells) but not in the rest of the virus. This pattern is clearly found in both &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/04/ba2-omicron-variant-covid-surge/629474/?utm_source=yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:BA.1 and BA.2 versions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;BA.1 and BA.2 versions&lt;/a&gt; of Omicron, as well as the variant that gave rise to JN.1, which drove last winter’s COVID surge. Bloom now says he has “very high confidence” that these variants came from chronic infections. The evidence is not as clear with other variants, he told me, but they could very well have evolved in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Long before COVID, Bloom had tracked the &lt;a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/26875.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:evolution of influenza;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;evolution of influenza&lt;/a&gt; during chronic infections in four immunocompromised patients; some mutations in these patients eventually showed up in the seasonal flu. I &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/06/evolution-of-the-flu/531693/?utm_source=yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:wrote about;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;wrote about&lt;/a&gt; the study when it was published in 2017, intrigued by the possibility that chronic infections could predict changes in flu from year to year. At the time, this was quite a novel idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Flu and COVID evolution do differ in important ways, but chronic COVID infections, too, are now being examined as harbingers of the future. “Those will actually teach us a lot about the future tricks SARS-CoV-2 will come up with,” says Simon, a microbiologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. To discover what those might be, she and van Bakel are now leading a &lt;a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/bwoQvHcXK0S4oZ3fGE8iWQ/project-details/10889260#description" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research project;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;research project&lt;/a&gt; to create better tools for sequencing chronic infections and to better understand which immunocompromised patients are most at risk for carrying them.

                    &lt;p&gt;Adding a personalized mRNA vaccine to standard treatment could offer new hope for pancreatic cancer patients, a small yet promising study from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study followed 16 patients, including Barbara Brigham, who joined the trial after a routine scan discovered her early-stage pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside surgery and chemotherapy, patients received a customized mRNA vaccine, designed using their own tumors. Unlike vaccines that aim to prevent disease in the first place, this one aims to help a patient's own immune system fight their cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brigham, a 74-year-old semi-retired librarian from Long Island, didn't hesitate to try it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The prognosis was not good when I was diagnosed," she said in a CBS News report. "You know you're going to have a limited amount of time. I just wanted to extend that time." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mRNA vaccine works by targeting genetic mutations found in pancreatic cancer, alerting the immune system to recognize and attack the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During surgery, doctors removed each patient’s tumor and sent it to the German biotechnology company BioNTech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patients then received their personalized vaccine along with immunotherapy and chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because "the immune system is hardwired not to recognize our own body," it's typically challenging to teach it to recognize cancer, said surgical oncologist Dr. Vinod Balachandran, who specializes in pancreatic cancer treatment."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 16 patients who participated in the study, eight had a strong immune response, and six of those eight remained cancer-free more than three years later, according to findings published Feb. 19 in the journal Nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, seven of the eight patients who didn’t respond saw their cancer return. The difference seemed to depend on whether the patient’s spleen was removed during surgery, as the spleen plays a critical role in immune function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s still hard to attribute causality to the vaccine alone,” Balachandran cautioned, emphasizing the trial’s small size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Suneel Kamath, a gastrointestinal oncologist at Cleveland Clinic who reviewed the findings, pointed out that the survival rate of the patients in the trial is similar to the survival rate of those with early-stage pancreatic cancer treated with surgery and chemo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This was a nice kind of proof-of-concept study to show that we can make a vaccine for this disease, and it really does actually create an immune response, and an immune response that lasts," Kamath told CBS News. "That's a very nice backbone to build off of." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A larger, randomized trial is now underway, focusing on early-stage pancreatic cancer patients whose spleens are intact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The beauty of mRNA vaccines, as we saw with COVID development, is they're very fast to make. It easy to generate. Once you found a new target, it's very quick to make a vaccine for that particular target," Kamath said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's really exciting, because when we talk about curing cancer, it's not really a single monolithic disease," he added. "There are probably hundreds of different targets for every cancer type. And so the ability to make vaccines against a lot of those different targets very quickly is really powerful." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers are also exploring mRNA vaccines for melanoma and cancers of the kidney and lung, which they theorize may respond better because of their ability to mutate more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Brigham, the trial gave her exactly what she hoped for -- more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past few months, she welcomed her eighth grandbaby and celebrated her brother's 60th wedding anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The trial was such a wondrous thing," she said. "It has just given me such a renewal in my life. Sometimes it's a little difficult, but it's worth it, absolutely worth it." &lt;/p&gt;

For the last 10 years she hasn't been able to eat a thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead Annie has been forced to survive on IV-administered nutrition to keep her alive. And she has been told her condition is terminal. "When I was a teen, I started struggling with dizziness, fainting spells and digestive issues," Annie said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Doctors couldn't figure out what was wrong with me until eventually a urine and blood test confirmed I had Autoimmune Autonomic Gangliopathy (AAG)." Annie explains that AAG is a lifelong disease that causes her immune system to attack healthy nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Annie's case, the condition has worsened over the years. She has had to have multiple surgeries to remove over 10 feet (3 metres) of her bowel. This has left her with Intestinal Failure, a condition where the intestines cannot absorb enough nutrients and fluids to sustain the body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="image-container" data-redesign-embed="true"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;"It's hard to explain to people what it feels like to never be able to eat," Annie says. "Food is such a normal part of everyday life for most, but for me, it's something I can't even consider. There's a lot of isolation that comes with it. I can't join in on social meals, and the smell of food cooking can make me feel incredibly sick. It's hard to be around something that's a normal part of life for everyone else but a danger to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"At just age 12 I started getting sick, not thinking much of it. By age 15 it was getting worse. I had been back and forth to doctors with numerous issues. By age 16 my life started to change forever. By age 18 I was given a diagnosis. By age 22 I became terminal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I isolated myself from society because I was stuck going through hell whilst everyone moved on with their life's. Spending months and months on end in hospital, going months with no visitors. I didn't want anyone to know I was sick. I just gathered I would get better and I could remove that 'era' from my life. How wrong was I.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I never thought this would be it. I never saw my life ending soon (heck no one does) but not being able to plan or even think about the future just breaks my soul.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Months of horrible torturous symptoms, procedures, surgeries and awful medications. One of those being high dose steroids. Anyone who has had steroids know the awful side effects that come along with it. One of the most obvious moon face and fluid retention. Leaving me sometimes gaining 20 plus kilos in one week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="image-container" data-redesign-embed="true"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The pain, the suffering , the loneliness no one can understand until they have been in that position. Life is so bloody short, and if there's one thing I want everyone to do for me is LIVE! Make the most of every day because the fact you woke up today, the fact you're not stuck in bed is one of the most amazing gifts you can have."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Annie's only lifeline is Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN), a medical treatment where fluid containing essential nutrients, fats, and proteins is delivered directly into the bloodstream. The TPN solution is administered via a Hickman line, a central catheter placed into a large vein near the heart. Every night for 12 hours, Annie is hooked up to an IV drip that runs all night, providing the nutrients her body needs. Without TPN, Annie's body would starve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But living on TPN isn't as simple as it may sound. It requires strict adherence to a sterile setup every time she connects to the drip, as any bacteria entering the Hickman line can lead to &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/what-sepsis-signs-symptoms-treatment-7246541"&gt;sepsis&lt;/a&gt; - a life-threatening infection. "I've become my own nurse at home," Annie explains. "I had to learn to set up my TPN in a completely sterile way. If even a tiny bit of bacteria gets into my line, it can travel straight to my heart."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the years, Annie has endured multiple bouts of sepsis, each one more dangerous than the last. The infections have left her with limited vein access, making placing a new Hickman line harder. She continues: "If I lose this last line, I will enter end-of-life care and will starve to death. It's a terrifying thought. I am now undergoing the removal of all my teeth at once to hopefully prevent further sepsis."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite its life-saving nature, TPN comes at a significant financial cost. The treatment costs Annie between £1,650 and £2,470 every week, and that doesn't include the extra supplies needed to maintain a sterile environment. The costs aside, the psychological strain is a major part of Annie's daily life, as she navigates the reality of a terminal diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="image-container" data-redesign-embed="true"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;"In 2022, my illness became terminal, and I was told that if my heart were to stop, I would not be resuscitated, and I started palliative care. Hearing that news was heartbreaking, but I've tried to focus on making the most of the time I have left," she adds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite her own struggles, Annie is determined to make a difference for others living with TPN. She has launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise awareness and support.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I want to help keep the unit running and provide better facilities," Annie noted. "Right now, the unit is in a small, crowded office in ICU with limited space to care for patients."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The funds raised through her GoFundMe will go towards hiring additional nurses, providing training for medical staff, supporting families of TPN patients, and purchasing essential equipment like a Fibroscanner, which can cost £16,400 to monitor liver health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"My illness may be terminal, but I want my legacy to be about helping others. I'm not giving up. There's so much more I want to do to help others, even if my time is limited," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;scroll-depth-observer data-event-markers="1%,25%,50%,75%,90%,100%"&gt;&lt;/scroll-depth-observer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Mirror</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 12:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE9YbVQzbm5ucGhTQzMtdExNckRHSmc0SjctT1dhZndIT1B5T0ZxZWFlS1IxSC1DaDlOTVRlSEZaQWFsX0F3S1FLRTBwYU5uSUU3eXlXVE9lYjk4c1BNZGlXa1F3d0t6bTBlMThyRzRXdkd3MHMteWFmTNIBfkFVX3lxTE0ydXJud19xQ0ozeG1UZktCOUVwNlNfMlc0ajFvU21QdDNXQmNfMENZUzFTajNocmdUNDFkblVuWVU1UmNlakxtUFpPTTVzWlBUaEFjXy1yd3JJOUFmNXZCVkFBTTliS1dkdl83SFNsVXJtam5GOWJYUW9MZEJsQQ</guid></item><item><title>Want To Know How Fit You Really Are?

You may have overheard the term "VO2 max" at the gym or on a trainer’s social media page recently—but what is this fitness number, exactly?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the ultimate test for your lungs—a measure of how much oxygen your body can take in and use when you're exercising at max effort, says Stacy Sims, PhD, exercise physiologist and author. It’s often considered the gold standard for &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a22995307/cardio-exercises/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cardiorespiratory;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cardiorespiratory&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; fitness—think of it as your personal record for oxygen consumption. The higher your VO2 max, the more efficiently your body churns out energy, which can mean better endurance, stronger performances, and a whole lot more stamina, says Sims. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re trying to crush a 5K, keep up in a HIIT class, or just feel less winded on the stairs, your VO2 max plays a major role. So, how do you figure out yours? And more importantly, how can you improve it? Keep reading for the full breakdown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/drstacysims/?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stacy Sims;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Stacy Sims&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, is an exercise physiologist and the author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ROAR-Fitness-Physiology-Optimum-Performance-ebook/dp/B01AC5JFR6?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.30796655%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Roar: How to Match Your Food and Fitness to Your Female Physiology for Optimum Performance, Great Health, and a Strong, Lean Body for Life.;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Roar: How to Match Your Food and Fitness to Your Female Physiology for Optimum Performance, Great Health, and a Strong, Lean Body for Life.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You Stand To Gain By Improving Your VO2 Max&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athletes obsess over VO2 max because a higher measure means intense efforts can be sustained for longer, but you don’t need to be a pro to benefit from a higher VO2 max. Boosting this number can improve your fitness in ways that directly impact your daily life and workout performance. Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easier cardio workouts:&lt;/strong&gt; Ever feel winded walking up stairs or during the first few minutes of a run? A higher VO2 max helps your body use oxygen more efficiently, meaning you can sustain effort longer without feeling exhausted, says Sims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better strength training endurance:&lt;/strong&gt; If your heart rate spikes and you gas out quickly during circuit training, supersets, or HIIT, improving VO2 max can help you recover faster between sets and push through tough workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased energy in daily life:&lt;/strong&gt; Your cardiovascular system plays a huge role in how energized you feel. A stronger VO2 max means your body delivers oxygen to muscles more effectively, which can translate to more stamina for everyday activities like chasing after kids, carrying groceries, or just staying alert throughout the day, says Sims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved recovery:&lt;/strong&gt; A higher VO2 max supports faster recovery after workouts, so you’re less likely to feel wiped out after an intense session and can train more consistently, Sims says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better overall health: &lt;/strong&gt;Studies link higher VO2 max levels to lower risks of cardiovascular disease, metabolic issues, and even cognitive decline as you age. It’s one of the strongest indicators of long-term health and longevity, says Sims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Figure Out Your Own VO2 Max&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing VO2 max is where things get a little tricky. The most accurate way to measure it is in a lab setting, says Sims. This involves a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), where you wear a mask and heart rate monitor while running on a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a27408852/hiit-treadmill-workout/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:treadmill;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;treadmill&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or cycling on a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a30345135/stationary-bike-workout/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stationary bike;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;stationary bike&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The mask is hooked up to a machine that measures how much oxygen you inhale and how much carbon dioxide you exhale. As the intensity ramps up, your oxygen consumption eventually plateaus—that’s your VO2 max. The final number is recorded in mL/kg/min (milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re serious about getting an exact measurement, check if any gyms or performance labs near you offer VO2 max testing. But let’s be real—that’s not something most people are going to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more practical way to estimate your VO2 max? A fitness tracker or smartwatch. Many devices, like the Apple Watch and Fitbit Ionic, calculate an approximation based on your heart rate and exercise intensity over time. Some brands even rebrand it—Fitbit calls it your “cardio fitness score,” while Apple keeps it simple as VO2 max (you can find yours in the Apple Health app under “All Health Data”). For the average active person, this is the easiest way to track improvements without stepping into a lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Garmin Vívosport&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074KD6XDY?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.30796655%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:246.94 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;246.94 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XR5TRSZ?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.30796655%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:272.45 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;272.45 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fitbit Ionic&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074VDF16R?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.30796655%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$299.00 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$299.00 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's considered a good VO2 max for women?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no perfect score for VO2 max—a desirable number really depends on your sport or main fitness activity, says Sims. Elite female cross-country athletes measure around 65 to 70 ml/kg/min, runners are about 60 to 65ml/kg/min, and cyclists are around 55 to 60 ml/kg/min, says Sims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, though, this VO2 max chart notes where optimal scores should fall depending on your age:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;(From McArdle Katch, Katch, 2003)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Jewelyn Butron&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Factors That Impact VO2 Max&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a22995307/cardio-exercises/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cardio fitness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cardio fitness&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; level isn't the only thing that plays a role. There are actually a number of internal and external factors that can have a major impact on your VO2 max, Sims says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="caas-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetics:&lt;/strong&gt; Yep, just like with anything, genes are key to your VO2 max. "Genetics is said to play a 20 to 30 percent role," says Sims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age:&lt;/strong&gt; "After the age of 25 VO2 max decreases by 1 percent a year," Sims says. "The good news is regular physical activity throughout life can offset much of the decline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training volume:&lt;/strong&gt; "Athletic training can alter a person's VO2 max as much as 20 percent depending on their lifestyle and fitness habits," says Sims. In other words, the more sedentary your lifestyle, the lower your VO2 max results will likely be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise mode of testing:&lt;/strong&gt; The method of fitness used during a VO2 max test can also alter the findings—a treadmill test may yield different results than, say, cycling or swimming. "&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a27408852/hiit-treadmill-workout/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Treadmill running;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Treadmill running&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to produce the highest values," says Sims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender: &lt;/strong&gt;Since women are generally physically smaller than men, their VO2 max values are on average 15 to 30 percent lower, says Sims. "That's because women have smaller hearts, lungs, and less hemoglobin, therefore, less oxygen uptake and delivery capacity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Body composition: &lt;/strong&gt;A major reason for the differences in VO2 max between men and women is attributed to body composition, or the ratio of lean muscle mass to body fat. But that said, if you were to compare a woman and man with similar physical characteristics (age, training status, and body composition), there wouldn't be a huge difference, says Sims. It's also important to note that VO2 max decreases as body fat percent increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Altitude: &lt;/strong&gt;If you're high up in the mountains, your VO2 max will be different than at sea level. That's simply because there is less oxygen to consume at higher altitudes, and as a result, your ability to take in oxygen decreases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Improve Your VO2 Max&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to boost your VO2 max is through &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g19988771/high-intensity-interval-training/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high-intensity interval training;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;high-intensity interval training&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (HIIT)—workouts that push you to work hard for short bursts, followed by recovery. This kind of training improves your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a28652016/aerobic-vs-anaerobic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:aerobic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;aerobic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; capacity by gradually increasing how efficiently your body uses oxygen, says Sims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can track your VO2 max regularly, it can be a great way to gauge your fitness progress over time. The good news? You don’t need fancy equipment or elite-level training to improve it. Here are some simple ways to level up your VO2 max:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try HIIT workouts&lt;/strong&gt;. Short, intense intervals (like sprinting for 30 seconds, then walking for 60) can help increase your aerobic capacity over time. Aim for two to three HIIT sessions per week, each lasting 20 to 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorporate steady-state cardio&lt;/strong&gt;. Longer, moderate-paced runs, swims, or cycles (think 45 to 60 minutes at a conversational pace) help improve endurance and heart health. Experts recommend &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a44868963/zone-2-cardio/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:two to four cardio sessions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;two to four cardio sessions&lt;/a&gt; per week, depending on your training goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add incline or resistance&lt;/strong&gt;. Walking or running on an incline or cycling with resistance forces your heart and lungs to work harder, building aerobic strength. Try one to two sessions per week, either as a dedicated workout or tacked onto a steady-state or HIIT session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay consistent&lt;/strong&gt;. Training regularly, even at lower intensities, helps keep your cardiovascular system strong and improves your overall fitness. A mix of three to five aerobic training sessions per week—at varying intensities—will help keep your VO2 max trending upward, says Sims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, while VO2 max is a useful metric in research and for elite athletes, Sims recommends not obsessing over it. Instead, focus on gradually pushing yourself in &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a22995307/cardio-exercises/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:workouts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;workouts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to get fitter and faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking for a place to start?

Some news outlets urged consumers to throw out their &lt;a href="https://img.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2024/12/17/black-plastic-kitchen-tools-toxic-replacement/" target="_blank"&gt;black plastic spatulas&lt;/a&gt;, which could be contaminated with recycled electronic waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XOZVEAEXUZBQLHAOJERA64NAZQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the study made an error, calculating the level the Environmental Protection Agency considers “safe” for one particular chemical at a tenth of what the agency actually recommends. The researchers have issued a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2024/12/17/black-plastic-kitchen-tools-toxic-replacement/" target="_blank"&gt;correction&lt;/a&gt; to address this miscalculation, but the mistake caused many to question whether black plastic was as dangerous as they thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J7GRCPRQNZCUTIK6UWQK25EBVI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Experts, however, say that the debate over the study — and over black plastic kitchen utensils — misses the point. The so-called safe level of flame retardants, they argue, is based on old science that doesn’t account for how different chemicals can accumulate&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QHG6LKAZVZHZDMKFB34PUNIRFU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The problem is not whether a single black plastic spatula can exceed the safe level — but whether that level should be considered safe at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4AVNCD5EMZGA7LBF2XV3N5K4OI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The reference dose is not a safe level,” said Tracey Woodruff, a professor of reproductive sciences at the University of California at San Francisco. And, she added, flame retardants accumulate in household dust and bodies over years and years — making it even more crucial to get the regulation right.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“If you make a mistake, your mistake is forever,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RQ3CWVEU4RAVVPM4VYQE6VOY6I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Scientists have known for years that flame retardants are dangerous to human health. PBDEs, or polybrominated diphenyl ethers, are a particularly harmful class of flame retardant that have been found to reduce children’s IQ, boost cancer rates and contribute to thyroid disease. To the body, PBDEs resemble thyroid hormones — and if thyroid hormones are askew, that affects brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4BFD3UEHIVHCJOM2LAYWJBIFQA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One &lt;a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp1632" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from Woodruff and her colleagues estimated that every 10-fold increase in PBDE exposure in a pregnant mother produces a 3.7-point IQ drop in her child once it’s born. “We can definitively say that they harm neurodevelopment,” said Woodruff. “They harm the developing brains of babies.” In another study, researchers found that people with the highest rates of PBDEs were four times more likely to die of cancer compared with those with the lowest levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ASJQLLATCVDPPDI7YIUBNWAN7Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These flame retardants used to be in many products, especially in California, where a 1975 state law required furniture to be fire-resistant. Now, however, they’ve largely been phased out except in electronics, where overheating batteries and circuit boards can create a fire risk. Those electronics, researchers &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160412018302125" target="_blank"&gt;have shown&lt;/a&gt;, are now being recycled into the black plastic used for kitchen utensils, toys and other household items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OCVKTI4MNVDV7NJEVSZLJTF2RY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The problem, researchers say, is that no one really knows what a “safe dose” of these flame retardants might be — and putting&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;them in black plastic gives them a second life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HFZIJ3KQRRCMZFDHKRCG2CUPJI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the study published last year, researchers found high levels of flame retardants in &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/10/05/have-black-plastic-your-home-it-could-expose-you-toxic-chemicals-researchers-say/" target="_blank"&gt;slotted pasta spoons, sushi trays and children’s black plastic beads&lt;/a&gt;. Initially, researchers noted that some items could approach the EPA limit of 42,000 nanograms a day for a person weighing around 132 pounds. But they clarified in a correction a few months later that the EPA limit is 420,000 nanograms per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TBSTKRQU75G5LDMKI3SSPLU52E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Megan Liu, co-author of the study, says the correction doesn’t fundamentally change the study’s results — they still found flame retardants in many household items, and in much higher quantities than most people would be comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EK5ICOZOWBG7PJ3RCK7RNDC52I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers have also questioned whether that federal exposure limit is accurate. “It’s an old number,” Liu said, pointing out that the safe dose was last evaluated almost 20 years ago, before most of the scientific research on PBDEs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JK5OXDSLLVARPH5CCPLCYO5IHY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That safe dose also accounts for only one specific type of PBDE. But people are exposed to dozens of different flame retardants and other toxic chemicals every day. One type might be accumulating in household dust, while another might be leaking out from a black plastic sushi tray. While using a black plastic spoon to scoop pasta might not&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;mean you’re ingesting chemicals over the approved limit, the combination of that and all your other activities might.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T64UUN5YFBBSHLZPDVRBBCFIZU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Our regulatory framework is set up chemical by chemical,” said Heather Stapleton, a professor of environmental chemistry at Duke University. “I personally would like us to look at exposures as whole.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3ECDP7ZHGBC4JA6MQ6TNFEQEDE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Woodruff says the safe doses are based on lab experiments that often use adult, healthy animals — and that might not capture the risks faced by more vulnerable people, like infants or pregnant women. “It’s portrayed as zero risk, but that’s simply not true.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="27GU5MBGB5D2DMNLI4BT63IU4A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At the same time, it is hard for scientists and consumers alike to know which kinds of specific flame retardants are in electronics or furniture, since companies are not legally required to disclose that information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TGQSD4JFLFCCTJN6UUWCRPDSJ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And while researchers can test the concentration of a flame retardant in a particular item, it’s hard for them to establish how much of it might make it from a sofa or a takeout food tray into someone’s body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="S6XTU6NSO5DFPE3EOYVUHBZQDI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Chlorinated tris, a flame retardant used as a replacement for PBDEs, was initially used in children’s pajamas, then phased out when scientists pointed out health risks. But it wasn’t outright banned and continued to be used in furniture, including baby and children’s mattresses. “You’ve got children, infants, babies breathing the air inches above the surface,” said Stapleton. “The fact that this doesn’t have to be disclosed — I find a little bit disturbing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="APBL7OM43JGHZHXIIV4FS4FOYA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Unless regulations change, scientists say, they will be stuck playing a kind of chemical whack-a-mole — knocking out one chemical only to face another that may have the same dangerous health consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C3ITGL2RBNGHVKC4ANKY3KDLKU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers are pushing for a more holistic approach, where the government would look at exposure to many flame retardants from several sources — not just black plastic. But progress has been slow, and many people still show evidence of toxic exposure. One study in Seattle, which sampled breast milk, found flame retardants in every one of the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/08/24/1194759795/flame-retardants-breast-milk-banned-chemicals" target="_blank"&gt;50 women&lt;/a&gt; studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="I5VILA7QOFG3TH4HEOHPPMQG2U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Liu sees black plastic as part of a larger issue — but also one that might be easy to avoid. New York State has banned PBDEs in televisions, she pointed out, and the European Union has put strict limits on their use in most consumer products. “This chemical is being banned in televisions,” she said. “Why should we be okay with it in the products that are touching your food or that your children are playing with?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 11:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPNzFaY3pPdUxRbGUzVVlhaEp4cHhGczM5OWxCNTZnLVZzbk10Y3djaWNQdzBhb0VUbUJYOGtjdFNPQnU4SHpNQ1gxdkRobF9iTmhRLTJaR1paNzRsaXRTRnpEc1Y0ZjU3Z2lVQUxsTFZUQWtxWXFqOWoxUWhNYUZJMTV6clN6TXY3ZVBpdFh6ajlfM2xYWnQxNEdYM0hqU1ZCTWgycXhHUGJCOFIz</guid></item><item><title>SIUH nurse is now in role of care-seeker for her 2-year-old, battling leukemia detected in routine well check - SILive.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi5gFBVV95cUxNSnR4YVBfa1hrajhjOXV0djg0QWZ5WmlzVmQ4SlRkLWRsS3N4SFB5ZEtrdkI0UXZhUE1PNDZFLTVyb1RFVkFjaDhSdXpBMkp1YWtRbjhpVkpLc1ZRT2RLc215ank4ZU1lRGZabXpLQXZfSmtKWnh0U1JqRG9JbUN1R0xBc2JSS3FYM2JUMGhwQm1JS1VGU2pGRWxfVEVPSFVMQW5jaVBmMmkwYkpjakp5d1lQRVpMOWRrNzlXTVhXdHdCWkl5c3VuUWFjSzRJeDdYSnlza0VMRzJvUnVjVmNrV2x2NEZqd9IB-gFBVV95cUxOQS10eXpYelZGS284UThNRXFHMUYxSC00OTVyOTJ0MXR5RzMyVUJUSGtlcmR3SWo2NC1jdFRnTW1ELUZvWGh6MkQtOVJraGZnLU9aaXJrUzM0TWpEMzB2QTZtVmlUY19oQkZTUGluTm41d055TEJ3VGcwUUZxcmQwWmRUNE1yby00dDU4aDdfejgzUlN5ZFFLbUJpWHl2OUVzZHBVY3QwenItcTc3UHVoTDZJVHkzVXRweEM3dm5ROVBpSWdCWk1kOXh1SzRrdUlmUHdzR1BYTHdzVkpzUk5ZcF9WOWRrNkZZWmJ6SFVxbTQ5dGlKejh1NUN3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5V3UAXRT2JAMNAJ23OWWFWUHKY"&gt;STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Staten Island toddler Aurora Joy Connors’s second birthday on Jan. 19 came with a routine well check at the doctor’s office, but what started as a standard assessment of her growth and development quickly became something more serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KG7ZTADMXVECPMR4IQV2UH7VYY"&gt;“There were no symptoms, but her white blood cells were elevated,” Aurora’s mother Desiree Ambrosio-Connors of Westerleigh said. “That prompted further investigation and further lab work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FVWFWIB22VBRTDQV7LQZVUMQCQ"&gt;The toddler’s grandmother and her father, Thomas Connors, took her for a second round of blood work, leading to Aurora’s official diagnosis with leukemia on Friday, Feb. 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RN6S3PS6JBEYRLX6BBPLJSSIHI"&gt;Desiree, a nurse practitioner, left for work early that morning at Staten Island University Hospital (SIUH), not knowing she wouldn’t return home for more than a week, she shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="T2J5X3S5A5GKZHHTYBYRQADOZA"&gt;“While I was on the clock at work, I got a phone call from the hematologist at SIUH saying, ‘Aurora needs to go to the emergency room to repeat her blood work... it doesn’t look right,’” Desiree said. “My nursing instincts and my mother instincts just kicked in, and I said, ‘This is bigger than what everyone originally thought it was.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XRMDUPS2BZGBDJQQ4CQIZE3MBY"&gt;She emphasized the importance of secondary preventive measures, such as routine screenings for all age groups and demographics, even if you’re healthy.

Frequently feeling ‘fed up’ is certainly an unhappy way to go through life, but did you know, according to recent research, it could actually make a significant difference to whether or not you fall ill and even die prematurely?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists at &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/oxford-university/index.html" id="mol-a11a83d0-f211-11ef-a154-c36c30f7afa6"&gt;Oxford University&lt;/a&gt; tracked half a million people in the UK and studied the effects of a range of ‘modifiable’ environmental factors – meaning the harm could be prevented – on several diseases including cancers of the breast, lung, prostate, ovaries, colon, pancreas, liver, oesophagus and blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some factors – such as smoking, poor diet, living in a deprived area and exercise levels – may come as little surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But I was particularly struck that someone’s attitude to life can also affect them so profoundly that it can actually significantly increase their risk of premature death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s well known that severe &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-a1163e10-f211-11ef-a154-c36c30f7afa6"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; is a serious condition that ruins lives and requires medical help. Yet apart from this there are also a lot of people who, although not clinically depressed, find themselves nevertheless blighted by negativity they can’t shake off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a condition known as ‘dysthymia’ – persistent, low mood that brings with it little interest in life, a general sense of unfulfillment and a lack of productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sadly, because it doesn’t tend to interfere with day-to-day life in the way that depression does, those affected often don’t seek treatment – and family and friends just dismiss them as being ‘a bit of a grump’ or a ‘misery’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rather like Eeyore from A A Milne’s Winnie-the-Pooh, everything always seems to be downbeat for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;There are also a lot of people who, although not clinically depressed, find themselves nevertheless blighted by negativity they can't shake off&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They may not be classically depressed, but simply live their lives under a permanent shadow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet this latest research underlines the vital importance of addressing low mood and the effects it can have on health, wellbeing and your lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it’s all very well knowing that you need to change your attitude – it’s another thing being able to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One effective way can be using cognitive behavioural therapy, or CBT. This is a form of talking treatment, available on the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-642e0fb0-f215-11ef-a154-c36c30f7afa6"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;, that research shows can help people to alter their perspective on the way they live their lives by challenging and changing negative and unhelpful thoughts and behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, if you’re feeling down in the dumps and find life a grind, don’t put up with it –because help is at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Your GP can refer you for CBT but in the meantime, here are some simple suggestions that I have found to be helpful for my own patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;WRITE IT ALL DOWN ON PAPER&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing your worries down helps you clarify what is on your mind. Make a list of everything that seems hard to deal with in one column – and in another jot down ideas that might help to address these or improve things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You might not be able to come up with answers to everything but you should be able to find solutions that may help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This will help dispel any feelings of hopelessness, which are a hallmark of negative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;CHALLENGE YOUR ASSUMPTIONS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can be easy to mistake negative thoughts for fact – so you need to challenge them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you start to think ‘I feel really depressed’, make an effort to challenge this by telling yourself: ‘It’s normal for moods to go up and down. This will pass.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;TRAIN YOURSELF TO THINK POSITIVELY&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thinking positively takes practice. As soon as you have a negative thought, make yourself pause and think of three positive things to counter it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, if you are served a dish you don’t like, rather than allowing yourself to dwell on it, concentrate on how nice it is to have someone cook for you, the pretty pattern on the plate and the delicious dessert you’ll be having afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; If you keep doing this you’ll find that eventually more upbeat thoughts will come naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;ALWAYS COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end of each day, look back over what happened and identify at least three things that went well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;We all have a tendency to dwell on our mistakes and the problems we encountered. But every day is full of good elements too, if we only train ourselves to look for them. Over time, it will become a habit and each day will start to appear brighter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;LEARN TO ACCEPT DISAPPOINTMENT&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Having a positive outlook isn’t about being relentlessly upbeat. It’s normal to have disappointments in life, but what matters is how you approach them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Accept that it happened and try to learn from it. One tip is to write down the disappointment, what happened and what was within your control to do differently. This will help you move on and put into perspective your own part in things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;Emma’s trauma is all too real &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/sport/emma-raducanu/index.html" id="mol-644c1f00-f215-11ef-a154-c36c30f7afa6"&gt;Emma Raducanu&lt;/a&gt; posted a statement on Instagram after being left in tears last Tuesday when a ‘fixated’ man was removed from the crowd during a second-round tennis match in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/dubai/index.html" id="mol-6435d7e0-f215-11ef-a154-c36c30f7afa6"&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt;, which she later lost. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Emma Raducanu had a frightening experience when she spotted a 'fixated' man in the crowd at a tennis match in Dubai&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Although we know little about the background to the incident, the distress it caused to poor Emma was all too clear to see. It reminded me of a time a few years ago when I was bothered by a very persistent patient.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt; Although such incidents are often not pursued by the police, it is important to recognise that a pathologically intense focus on someone else can quickly escalate with consequences. That is because many of those who behave in this way have profound mental health problems and psychological difficulties. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;The emotional toll on the victim can drag on for years, devastating all aspects of their lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;The Government is cracking down on vape use and also conducting a social media campaign to dissuade people from taking it up. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;But while it’s clear the habit isn’t good for children, it’s not so clear for adults.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt; In 2020, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found 2,807 cases of vape-associated lung injury(EVALI) and 68 deaths attributed to it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;But most EVALI cases were in people who had modified their vape to smoke THC (cannabis). I fear the move by the Government risks scaring adults off vapes – and back to smoking cigarettes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;Dr Max prescribes... learning a language &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Being able to speak a second language increases the size of your brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;We have known for a while that people who speak a second language develop dementia over five years later than &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;those who can’t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;A study has found out why – having another language increases the size of the brain, meaning it has greater reserves if it develops problems. Brain efficiency is also improved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite worries about the efficacy of such schemes, NHS trusts are still recruiting DEI (diversity, equality and inclusion) staff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many are hired on twice the pay of a junior doctor. Yet the evidence for DEI is flimsy. How can the NHS justify this waste? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 11:20:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxNWDhqczNNVnpWU190b3NBSUJJeXhncVpYNG11RlJlVDFqdjJrTFcwZklDZm9rVGFYMWpHb3E4aUk5R2RBdEtYd3E1SFJpMEZJZjVVVmUwZEtwM094cm8wX2RPN0hhdjlCNElTQ1RZQ1dlb1BwV0FlX0E4emI0TWoxT1VIWEZUbVY3YmktRzBuM1VyYk5tOC0wdFVHSTNNLWs2QUtpdXQxaTdIM1NvMHM5UjJjVHJvc2pGNFliLTFwNFlnNDNVVHFhZw</guid></item><item><title>Norovirus outbreak on the cruise ship Iona sounds like real-life vomiting scene from "Triangle of Sadness" - Boing Boing</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Boing Boing</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 11:07:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>World's first study shows side-effects of vaping – have your say - Cambridgeshire Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxQaVQxZXdaanRBVVJ4aVdzLVlzTXFIb05PQmR1YUtBNDNyVkVheGlXVHBTVDE2M1VyaG9jVE41U24xak0xNGdoTjQ0Z1dRNk5QalpQVERRelREM1VMQlgwVVgzYjJfYWtCWkNrYTFDa0NGNm4wVmpPZlRrN0dEajhEV0pTbWM1Ykx4UHdzbUNYRDRYRnM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaping could pose a greater risk to health than traditional cigarettes, potentially leading to dementia, heart disease, and organ failure, according to the author of a pioneering study. This is despite the NHS's stance that inhaling nicotine vapour from E-cigarettes is "significantly less harmful than smoking".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;World's first study shows side-effects of vaping. Should restrictions go further? Or is this all to be expected? &lt;a data-content-type="section" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/news-opinion/worlds-first-study-shows-side-31068337#comments-wrapper" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;Join in the conversation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Maxime Boidin, who is spearheading the world's first controlled study into the long-term effects of vaping at Manchester Metropolitan University, set to conclude in March, warned that the risks for vapers may be even more severe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said: "Smokers tend to go outside and smoke, and once a cigarette is finished they have to light up another to keep going. But with vapes, you just keep going and it's much harder to know how many puffs you've had. It's much easier to vape continuously because you can do it in places where smoking might be less acceptable."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Boidin added: "What we have found is the dangers for someone who keeps vaping are no different from smokers. At the beginning (of the study) I also believed that vaping was more beneficial than smoking. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"You see a lot more people vaping these days because they don't think it's too bad. Many will be horrified to know the truth."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research, carried out at the university's Institute of Sport, involved participants aged between 18 to 45, with an average age of 27, who had similar fitness and physical activity levels. They underwent regular stress tests to assess the elasticity of their blood vessels and the rate of blood flow to their brains, &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/worlds-first-study-reveals-truth-34719574" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;as reported by the Mirror&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Participants were asked to only consume water and refrain from vaping, smoking and exercise for a period of 12 hours before testing. Dr Boidin explained that the Flow-Mediated Dilation (FMD) test, which involves placing a cuff on the participant's arm, inflating it to restrict blood flow, then releasing it to measure how much the artery expands as more blood is passed through it, produced the most significant results.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the final weeks of the study, researchers observed that both smokers and vapers recorded flat readings, indicating damaged artery walls that can no longer dilate – a likely precursor to serious cardiovascular issues. Further tests confirmed that the blood flow in smokers and vapers is similarly compromised, putting them at risk of developing cognitive dysfunction, including dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Boidin, a senior lecturer in cardiac rehabilitation, has linked the damage to inflammation caused by nicotine and other substances found in vapes, such as propylene glycol and vegetable glycerine. He pointed out that chemicals in flavourings, like carbonyl compounds, can cause inflammation and oxidative stress, which may lead to harm to the inner wall of arteries and cell death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He cautioned: "When you put this mixture of metals and chemicals into your body you can't expect nothing to happen."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vaping has soared in popularity since electronic cigarettes were introduced to the UK market in 2005. Data from the Office for National Statistics last year indicates that around one in 10 British adults aged 16 or over, equating to about 5.1 million people, are now vaping.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The highest prevalence is seen among the 16 to 24 age group, where 15.8% vape. In England, there's been a significant uptick in vaping among individuals who have never regularly smoked, with numbers reaching one million – a sevenfold increase in three years – according to research published in The Lancet Public Health Journal by University College London.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Public Health England still asserts that "vaping poses a small fraction of the risks of smoking" but says "evidence is mostly limited to short and medium term effects and studies assessing longer term vaping are necessary".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The alarm has also been raised by incidents like collapsed lungs and reports of individuals fainting or vomiting an ominous green substance, linked to heavy use of e-cigarettes. Dr Boidin, who is soon to publish his study, said he's found proof that even the fitness of youthful vapers can be adversely affected. He claimed that vaping might be riskier than smoking owing to the challenge in knowing when to stop.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Adam Petrulevic, 25 and pursuing a master's in strength and conditioning, admits to continuous vaping. "I never really smoked, but I started vaping two years ago," he said. "I always thought it was much less harmful than smoking."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He continued: "I take a puff every few minutes and only stop when I go to sleep. A 500-puff vape used to last me a few days but now it's not even a day. Now I'm on 3,500-puff vapes which should be more than a week, but I finish them in three days."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Marine, another member of the study aged 33, took up vaping as a smoking substitute. She said: "I didn't smoke in the house but now I vape all day long. I decided to take part in the study because I wanted to know what it was doing to me. I've noticed that I'm out of breath more, I feel that it's not so good for my health."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both Adam and his colleague were greatly disturbed by Dr Boidin's disconcerting research results. Adam said: "It's definitely an incentive for me to stop."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recent events have raised concerns regardless of the unchanged guidance, including the untimely death of Hollyoaks actor Paul Danan at 46, who had previously revealed a near-fatal encounter due to respiratory failure linked to excessive vaping. Other frightening cases involve people having collapsed lungs, episodes of fainting, or even vomiting an alarming green substance, all attributed to extensive use of vapes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Smokers tend to go outside and smoke, and once a cigarette is finished they have to light up another to keep going. But with vapes you just keep going and it's much harder to know how many puffs you've had," Marine added: "I'm going to quit. I never expected vapes to be as bad as cigarettes."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Government has announced that disposable vapes – brightly packaged devices that come in sweet-like flavours and have been blamed for a rise in teenage users – will be banned from June.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Boidin has expressed strong views that all vapes in Britain should only be available through a prescription to prevent a looming "health emergency".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said: "The only benefit of vaping is to help people quit smoking, but if they keep vaping the result is going to be the same. I think doctors should be able to prescribe vapes for a certain time, so they could be used as a transition tool, but only for a short time. We now know the long-term effects of vaping, and if we don't act now we will see a health emergency in the next ten, 15 years."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, York Central's Labour MP, Rachael Maskell, who advocates for tougher restrictions on vapes, said: "This study adds to the body of evidence that vaping can cause significant harm to a person. The government should take stricter measures in ensuring that vapes are only accessible to people who currently smoke as a smoking cessation intervention."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Marina Murphy, scientific spokesperson for the UK Vaping Industry Association, has disputed the findings of a recent study, saying, "Millions of people have been using vaping products safely for many years. All the available data suggests that vapes are unlikely to exceed 5% of the health risks associated with cigarettes."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;World's first study shows side-effects of vaping. Should restrictions go further? Or is this all to be expected? &lt;a data-content-type="section" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/news-opinion/worlds-first-study-shows-side-31068337#comments-wrapper" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;Join in the conversation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Cambridgeshire Live</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 11:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxQaVQxZXdaanRBVVJ4aVdzLVlzTXFIb05PQmR1YUtBNDNyVkVheGlXVHBTVDE2M1VyaG9jVE41U24xak0xNGdoTjQ0Z1dRNk5QalpQVERRelREM1VMQlgwVVgzYjJfYWtCWkNrYTFDa0NGNm4wVmpPZlRrN0dEajhEV0pTbWM1Ykx4UHdzbUNYRDRYRnM</guid></item><item><title>Trainer says these are the three best exercises for full-body strength and longevity - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxOb3QyY1lTVGFfekVSZWVIRXZTRmlvNXdETUJ6Q0VWZXZxYUw2ZUZHN21OVXpoRHVIUEs2QnJVUTd1TVdBaVA5MU1yN0YzX2VnMjloSC1Pd3BiS2h4S05TZnBjY3FFOUdkMExlWk5sdEFPUE9LV1FTU1Y3ZXJlaDJ0NGhwQVdLYzRGdHhOdm1NMnRTQWtsVUJmc1FCaGMxalMzWHZCRFJR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 lkPksW sc-jbiisr-1 hiukpJ" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 cFynzd" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-0 eFDpwi"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 jkkqcL"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 dDFcwe"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 kqOtlp"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 bjQKsM"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 hWxisF sc-hez36s-16 gBaKpR"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 ifXxYf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 jlvSeZ"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 ghJHgZ"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 bhFQeV"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 gMxIQB"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

This is because &lt;a href="/topic/strength-training"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; can help us “stay vibrant, physically independent and disease-free in our final decades”, says Ollie Thompson, personal trainer and founder of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://welltolead.com/"&gt;Welltolead&lt;/a&gt;, a performance-focused health coaching company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my opinion, the benefits of maintaining healthy muscle are highly underrated,” he says. “Resistance training is crucial for long-term &lt;a href="/news/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; – not just from a movement perspective, staying physically strong and mobile, but also for maintaining overall physiological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consistent resistance training enhances metabolic function by improving insulin sensitivity, supports cardiovascular health by reducing &lt;a href="/topic/blood-pressure"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/topic/inflammation"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, helps maintain hormonal balance to combat age-related declines, preserves bone density to reduce fracture risk, and strengthens the immune system to help fight off disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to help you build strength, Thompson has shared three &lt;a href="/topic/gyms"&gt;gym&lt;/a&gt; exercises he believes hold the most value if training for &lt;a href="/topic/longevity"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt; is your goal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-2 epFywa EqCSl"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assisted chin-up &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bulgarian split squat &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Farmer’s carry &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wypyku-0 sc-1qbn810-0 kULwBk fWblEi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on my experience, if we define longevity as living better for longer – with an emphasis on staying vibrant, physically independent and disease-free in our final decades – then these are the top three gym exercises for longevity,” says Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When combined, they can strengthen muscles across your upper and lower body, boosting joint health, developing balance and coordination, and improving your posture, among other perks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/anne-hathaway-workout-trainer-plank-b2695184.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This one-move workout from Anne Hathaway’s trainer builds core stability in just three minutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do an assisted chin-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie thompson demonstrating an assisted chin-up" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-40857"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie thompson demonstrating an assisted chin-up&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place a barbell in a rack at roughly chest height. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sit on the ground under the barbell then reach overhead and grasp it with an underhand grip, hands roughly shoulder-width apart. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your feet on the floor for support, pull your body upwards until your chin is above the bar. Think about squeezing your shoulder blades together as you do this. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slowly control yourself back to the starting position. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over time, try to provide less support with your feet to make the exercise more challenging, in line with your increasing strength levels. You can also use an assisted pull-up machine or resistance band to perform this exercise. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the assisted chin-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/courteney-cox-chin-up-workout-b2625004.html"&gt;chin-up&lt;/a&gt; has a somewhat intimidating reputation. But by using a machine, resistance band or even a lower pull-up bar and supporting yourself with your feet, Thompson says it can be scaled to suit most fitness levels. And adding it to your regular routine unlocks plenty of benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chin-up not only recruits multiple muscles across your back, biceps, forearms and core, but it’s also one of the best things you can do to develop a healthy set of shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One key reason I picked the assisted chin-up is that performing a full repetition – from a dead hang to the top with your chin at the bar – takes your shoulder blades through a full range of motion,” says Thompson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the bottom hanging position, with your hands supinated [palms towards you], you create external rotation at the shoulder joint while under load with your arms overhead – an excellent way to maintain strong, stable and well-functioning shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, this exercise can’t be beaten for training grip strength, which &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6778477/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have strongly correlated with healthier muscle mass and better longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/stanley-tucci-workout-b2630043.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stanley Tucci got into the ‘best shape of his life’ at 63 with this training method&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do the Bulgarian split squat &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie Thompson demonstrating a Bulgarian split squat" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-40858"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie Thompson demonstrating a Bulgarian split squat&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand one step in front of a bench or sturdy surface that’s around knee height. Face away from this surface. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in your left hand with your arm by your side, palm facing your body. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your right leg long and your hips square, place the top of your left foot on the bench behind you. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower your left knee until it’s just above the ground, keeping your chest up as you do this, then drive through your right foot to return to the starting position. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the Bulgarian split squat &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chin-up promises to strengthen multiple muscles across your upper body, and the Bulgarian split squat mirrors this for your lower half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a unilateral [single-limb] exercise, it’s excellent for building strength and stability at the hip, knee and foot, helping to correct severe muscular imbalances while also incorporating a balance component,” says Thompson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also challenges kinaesthetic awareness – your ability to sense your position and movement in space – which is a crucial skill for preventing trips and falls in later life.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are some impressive longevity credentials, and the Bulgarian split squat has another trick up its sleeve that elevates it above standard &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/how-to-squat-correctly-b2606171.html"&gt;squats&lt;/a&gt;, in Thompson’s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m a huge fan of this exercise because, when performed correctly, it not only engages every major muscle in the leg but also forces you into hip extension,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This position, where the leg moves behind the hip and midline, tends to weaken significantly with age. Developing strength and mobility in this range plays a key role in maintaining movement quality and walking mechanics, and it can also be instrumental in reducing back pain, hip pain and dysfunction in these areas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/walking-10000-steps-a-day-calories-fitness-b2650416.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking 10,000 steps a day might not matter if you don’t do this one thing, according to an expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do the farmer’s carry &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie Thompson performing a farmer's carry" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-40859"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie Thompson performing a farmer's carry&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in each hand with your arms by your side and your palms facing inwards. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining an upright torso and tight core, walk with the weights. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the farmer’s carry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The farmer’s carry is a refreshingly straightforward exercise: simply pick up a couple of &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/sports-equipment-accessories/best-dumbbells-home-hand-weights-b1847563.html"&gt;dumbbells&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/best-kettlebell-set-workout-b1837551.html"&gt;kettlebells&lt;/a&gt; and take them for a walk. This simplicity means it’s overlooked, but Thompson says those who omit it are missing out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The farmer’s carry is an exercise I don’t see performed nearly as often as it should be. Here’s why: it’s a full-body movement that involves ambulation, it tests your grip strength and it’s fantastic for improving posture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It builds strong joints, enhances hip stability, challenges your balance, coordination and kinaesthetic awareness, and ultimately provides a brilliant way to build strength while also taxing your aerobic system.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, it will bolster your heart and lung health by having you breathing heavily, while also strengthening your entire body. The farmer’s carry is a viable option for the vast majority of people too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I often prescribe farmer's carries to my online clients because they are incredibly accessible and can be scaled easily, with progress easily tracked. Simply pick a challenging kettlebell or dumbbell, then walk for time, distance, steps or breaths. This way, you can keep track of how your performance improves over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/kettlebell-training-loaded-carries-b2691274.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘This will change your life’ – An expert strength coach shares the training method missing from your workouts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other things to consider when training for longevity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance training is Thompson’s top recommendation when exercising for longevity. But he says cardiovascular exercise – activities that raise your heart rate for a sustained period – should also be among your top priorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cardiovascular exercise is, of course, essential for heart health, but it also plays a critical role in mitochondrial function, reducing the risk of major diseases and cancers, supporting brain health, enhancing energy production, improving sleep quality and managing stress,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As well as resistance training, a well-rounded approach to exercising for longevity includes both low-intensity zone two cardio [performed at roughly 60-70 per cent of your maximum heart rate] and short bouts of high-intensity training. This combination builds both a wide aerobic base and a high aerobic peak – known as VO2 max – which is strongly associated with better health, longevity, and reduced all-cause mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/isle-of-man-wellness-retreat-b2696904.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I went on my first wellness retreat, and it wasn’t what I expected at all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 10:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOb3QyY1lTVGFfekVSZWVIRXZTRmlvNXdETUJ6Q0VWZXZxYUw2ZUZHN21OVXpoRHVIUEs2QnJVUTd1TVdBaVA5MU1yN0YzX2VnMjloSC1Pd3BiS2h4S05TZnBjY3FFOUdkMExlWk5sdEFPUE9LV1FTU1Y3ZXJlaDJ0NGhwQVdLYzRGdHhOdm1NMnRTQWtsVUJmc1FCaGMxalMzWHZCRFJR</guid></item><item><title>CT man watches his own surgery in real time without general anesthesia.

And only local anesthesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the surgery people can return to work, life, and sports with fewer complications, Gianakos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there are none of the risks of general anesthesia, including complications such as blood clots or the need for narcotic pain killers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patient Segraves said the ankle was “sore” for 24 hours and lessened each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gianakos said the long range plan for the type of surgery is to get used to moving it from a surgical suite to a procedure room, to the office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was really glad to be part of that progression because I thought it was really interesting,” Segrave said, of watching his own surgery in real time. “It was the best option to get me back to the things I like doing for many years to come.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segraves, who is in his 60s but extremely physically active, damaged his leg and ankle in 2023 while hiking in Montana when he slipped on wet vegetation. He was able to walk enough to get to safety. It turns out he had broken a bone in his leg and damaged his ankle. The leg healed more easily than the ankle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can’t wait to be back in the woods with a backpack and want to race my bike up the mountain,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segraves was a “great candidate” who even spoke during surgery and watched, although that’s optional, the doctor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gianakos, who was specially trained by another doctor in New York, said she’s trying to promote the technique in Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This new technology can benefit our patients, by providing a minimally invasive alternative treatment without the use of general anesthesia affording patients the ability to return to work and return to sport in a safe and efficient manner,” Gianakos said. “Ultimately, we plan to translate this care from the operating room setting to in the office setting (in-office nano arthroscopy, IONA).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are breaking new ground with these procedures allowing patients to be engaged during their procedure. In addition, patients are able to return to their day to day activities much quicker,” Gianakos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone would be interested in watching their own surgery, but Segraves has a biology-related career background and said he enjoyed that aspect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I could see everything happening it was incredibly cool to watch. I could see what looked good,” he said. “It was remarkable to see her surgical skills as she cleaned up my ankle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said it was also great to “get back to doing things quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Gianakos has great training, enthusiasm, understanding, and “it was nice working with her.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gianakos said she had been waiting for the “perfect patient” to perform the procedure in Connecticut and he was it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m trying to get other surgeons to do this,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also contain an essential omega-3 fatty acid called alpha-linolenic acid, which is essential to our health but cannot be made by our bodies, so we must get it from our diet. Chia seeds, which the Aztecs revered, are “high in several nutrients that are important for our bone health, including calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Harvard scientists, chia seeds can also reduce blood pressure, support digestive health, manage weight, protect against chronic disease, and improve anxiety and depression. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chia seeds can be used in weight management because they form a gel-like substance in the stomach that can increase one's feeling of fullness and decrease appetite. Harvard Health states that the fibre in chia seeds can help lower “bad” cholesterol and triglyceride levels and increase “heart-protective HDL” cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31065595" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can incorporate chia seeds into your diet simply by sprinkling them onto foods like yoghurt, cereal, smoothies, and salads or mixing them into pancake batter or other baked goods. Chia pudding, a simple dish that mixes the seeds with milk to create a thick, desert-like consistency, is also very popular.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chia seeds have a mild, nutty flavour that goes well with sweet and savoury dishes, so there are endless ways to enjoy them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The seeds are affordable in most supermarkets&lt;span&gt;, at around £1.20 for 150g. However, Cleveland Clinic explains that you should be careful not to eat too many, as this could cause digestive problems&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you're not drinking enough water, the seeds can absorb the water in your gut, which could lead to constipation, bloating, and gas. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many experts agree that adding one to two tablespoons of chia seeds to your daily diet—while staying properly hydrated—may be an easy way to improve gut health, reduce high blood pressure, stabilise blood sugar, and lower bad cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 10:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOVHViRzdCbzRjdk41TW8tNTBLNk81bm11WUJjUWhnTWxnMi01cW1wN2lKQzNWTVhWLW1TRjIxbWdxUmFhTm1JdTlseVRTdUpoWVFPR1htcXVwbmU2V01MUjAwMXRsOURWbWpzYks5alV5U2F6ZXlOcjQyckZpZEVHamF5T3BrSGN60gGOAUFVX3lxTE1wSE1sQTRNUktPd1A2ODZUNFgxeEhONk1RUC0xZlJNcjNXNjVmcHhreTBHZnRhZ1hDSzktVFhMM1lWR2VxMHdBMFF6U01xTzJza0pXdE1zR3ZPMGpqTVdfVzJoWTNlYktKQk1KaWkyb3hoMXhSNWZJM2E3NEx1bEt2RWlVVmJsVlBTMDhMbXc</guid></item><item><title>GPEI-Kingdom of Saudi Arabia confirms US$ 500 million commitment to global polio eradication effort - Global Polio Eradication Initiative</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixwFBVV95cUxQVWVwLUM0cnZ0QzZrMFBWQlpnbi1LTjlsNXl5amY0a0ZySFAtdTdGX09ZOGozbXFkRHJaNHV1RmN3akhVQnduUHQ4VEFfdjM1UmRXdGxwLTgzTUMzYWxhR2lac1hCc2xNOXE5R3B4eldGNFBXT2lkYmpyWG5zMHF2V2R0bGhfV1dCSGlmREdHZHJyVzBwQmF5d2N6UWVWaUtIQ0hwbGY5M2FZQmRVTUxOVnZXYnNybEFmRXl6ZGNhRE83UUxTWm9B?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gpei-content single-news-content"&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_28078" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-28078" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-28078 size-full" src="https://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/kingdom-of-saudi-arabia-confirms-us-500-million-commitment-to-global-polio-eradication-effort-main-e1740392848954.jpg" alt="L-R: H.E.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RIYADH (24 February 2025)&lt;/strong&gt; – The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia today reaffirmed its US$ 500 million pledge to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) in a signing event during the fourth Riyadh International Humanitarian Forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H.E. Dr. Abdullah al Rabeeah, Supervisor General of King Salman Relief and Humanitarian Centre, was joined by Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization; Catherine Russell, Executive Director of UNICEF; Dr. Sania Nishtar, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; Dr. Chris Elias, President of Global Development at the Gates Foundation and Chair of the Polio Oversight Board; and Aziz Memon, Pakistan Polio Plus Chair, Rotary International, to sign an agreement that will help the GPEI and its partners to reach 370 million children with polio vaccines each year and stop transmission of the virus for good. The funds were initially pledged in April 2024 at the first-ever World Economic Forum Special Meeting hosted in Riyadh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The world is on the path to eradicating polio once and for all, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is proud to be part of this global initiative,” said H.E. Dr. Abdullah al Rabeeah. “The Kingdom’s contribution will go toward the important work of protecting the most vulnerable children of today so that the generations of tomorrow can live free from this preventable disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of decades of leadership from GPEI partners, generous support from donors and the commitment of affected countries, polio cases have fallen by over 99% since the GPEI was founded in 1988. More than 20 million people are walking today who would otherwise have been paralyzed by the virus. But fraught humanitarian crises – from parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan to Somalia and Yemen – have allowed the virus to continue paralyzing the world’s most vulnerable children. In 2024, the virus returned to Gaza in the occupied Palestinian territory after 25 years to paralyze a child, a cruel reminder that as long as polio exists anywhere, children everywhere will remain at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have come so far in our shared mission to consign polio to history, but the last mile is the hardest,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Finishing the job requires unwavering determination, and this generous contribution from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will help us to reach children in conflict-affected and other difficult-to-reach areas as we work together to realize our vision of a polio-free world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As we saw in Gaza last year, the hard-won gains of the global eradication effort are fragile if vaccination rates are allowed to drop. With the support of committed partners like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we can better reach every child with life-saving vaccination and end polio, once and for all,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, governments and health workers, with support from the GPEI, are adapting to deliver polio vaccinations and other essential health services within humanitarian crises, while also strengthening health systems to bolster efforts in fragile contexts. Every commitment toward fully funding the GPEI’s extended 2022-2029 Strategy helps make this critical work possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just a few decades ago, polio paralyzed 350,000 children each year. In 2023, that number dropped to just 12 – a testament to the unwavering commitment of countries and partners worldwide. The world is at the brink of finally eradicating this deadly disease, but reaching the finish line will require continued global leadership and support,” said Bill Gates, chair of the Gates Foundation. “Thanks to this generous contribution from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, alongside long-standing efforts of many nations, we are one step closer to a polio-free world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the signing, H.E. Dr. Abdullah al Rabeeah will join GPEI and other global leaders and health advocates for a panel discussion on the importance of reaching all children with polio vaccines, eradicating the disease for good and improving global health security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Additional partner quotes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike McGovern, International PolioPlus Chair, Rotary International: “Saudi Arabia’s $500 million contribution is a pivotal step in our mission to eradicate polio. This funding will enable Rotarians and health workers to intensify their efforts in reaching every child, ensuring that no one is left vulnerable to this preventable disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sania Nishtar, CEO, Gavi: “Strengthening global immunization efforts is crucial to protecting children from preventable diseases. By enhancing immunization, we can ensure that children everywhere are safeguarded against a range of illnesses, including polio, and move closer to a healthier, more resilient world.”&lt;/p&gt;

(Photo by Allison Robbert/AFP via Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;THE COVID PANDEMIC THAT REACHED our shores in winter of 2020 has taken more than &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/ciss/2024/02/27/ciss-affiliates-analysis-reveals-many-excess-deaths-attributed-to-natural-causes-are-actually-uncounted-covid-19-deaths/" rel&gt;1.2 American lives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; thus far—a staggering loss, on the one hand, and a tribute to modern medicine on the other. Until well into the twentieth century, the arrival and spread of infectious disease was met with panic, confusion, blame, flight, and ultimately resignation. A significant change occurred following the Second World War, with the development of antibiotics and vaccines for the treatment and prevention of everything from polio to measles, mumps, and tuberculosis. What made the COVID pandemic unique was the “warp speed” with which medical researchers and federal officials responded, working hand-in-hand to develop and manufacture safe and effective vaccines that revolutionized the field while saving untold millions of lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s what makes the confirmation of anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for secretary of health and human services so troubling. Americans should be celebrating these milestones and demanding additional resources for the battles ahead. Instead, intense media scrutiny has provided a haul of previously unknown information about Kennedy and his organizations, including &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/health/aaron-siri-rfk-jr-vaccines.html" rel&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that a Kennedy confidant helping to vet candidates for high-ranking HHS positions had petitioned the Federal Drug Administration to withdraw its approval of the inactivated polio vaccine, which has stood for seventy years as the gold standard in the battle against infectious disease. Kennedy has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/senate-confirms-robert-f-kennedy-jr-vaccine-opponent-health-secretary" rel&gt;called for&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a years-long “pause” on infectious disease research, and Elon Musk’s DOGE has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/life-saving-research-risks-being-destroyed-by-the-federal-funding-freeze/" rel&gt;frozen billions of dollars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in federal grants for basic scientific and medical research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things could still get worse. Will junk science gain a serious foothold in decision-making bodies like HHS and its affiliated agencies? Will childhood vaccines now mandated by law become voluntary, or removed from circulation altogether? Putting a bullseye on the polio vaccine is a clear warning that even the safest, most proven vaccines aren’t safe from Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUT THERE’S MORE TO THE STORY. While the public health community is understandably fearful of attempts to undermine vaccination, there is, in fact, no consensus regarding the global campaign to eradicate polio. Some see it as an impossible task; others view it as a poor use of limited resources; still others believe that containment, rather than eradication, is the proper course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are two types of vaccines used to protect against polio: the injected killed poliovirus vaccine developed by Jonas Salk in the early 1950s, and the live oral poliovirus vaccine pioneered by Albert Sabin a decade later. In tandem, they have eliminated the disease in the developed world and come extremely close in the developing world. Reported cases of paralytic polio in the latter dipped from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/polio#:~:text=As%20you%20can%20see%2C%20several,number%20was%20down%20to%20649." rel&gt;tens of thousands per year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the 1980s to fewer than two thousand by the early 2000s. Today that number is lower still, but global eradication remains elusive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The campaign has been marred by a seemingly endless series of missed deadlines. In 1988, the World Health Organization and Rotary International, a remarkably generous private funder, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://polioeradication.org/about-polio/history-of-polio/#:~:text=Rotary%20International%20launched%20a%20global,1000%20children%20worldwide%20every%20day." rel&gt;resolved&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to end polio before the new century arrived. But problems arose that are yet to be fully solved. It had been known from the outset that the Sabin vaccine could revert to virulence in an infinitesimally small number of cases—about one in 750,000—primarily involving children with weakened immune systems. For that reason, the United States and most of the developed world went back to a more powerful version of the Salk vaccine in the 1990s, even though Sabin’s was cheaper and simpler to deliver.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the early 2000s, the Sabin vaccine appeared to be causing more cases of paralytic polio in the developing world than the wild poliovirus still circulating there. But the numbers were so low, and the vaccine so vital for mass-vaccination campaigns in hard-to-reach places, that it remained the vaccine of choice. The compromise strategy was to use the live poliovirus vaccine, along with a robust surveillance system, to eliminate the transmission of wild poliovirus, at which point the inactivated poliovirus vaccine would be phased in to safely maintain immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A sense of cautious optimism took hold by the first years of the millennium. Two prestigious journals, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, ran article articles under the headlines “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/35053235" rel&gt;Polio’s Last Stand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;” and “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.303.5666.1960" rel&gt;Polio: The Final Assault?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;” In 2007, the Gates Foundation &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.endpolio.org/rotary-and-gates-foundation-celebrate-10-years-of-working-together-to-end-polio" rel&gt;joined the cause&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, contributing more than $5 billion to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative over time. Each succeeding year began with the promise that “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/media-center/press-releases/2022/10/world-health-summit-gates-foundation-commits-over-one-billion-to-end-polio" rel&gt;Polio eradication is within reach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.” But fighting the disease became akin to a game of whack-a-mole: As soon as one area became polio-free, the virus would pop up in another. One observer described the effort as “trying to squeeze Jell-O to death.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2011, Bill Gates called for a “final push” to eradicate polio during an event at the Manhattan townhouse of Franklin D. Roosevelt, a polio survivor, which I attended with great pride. A decade after promises of imminent victory, however, a sense of weariness and defeat had overtaken parts of the public health community. Donald A. Henderson, an iconic figure who had led the successful global campaign to eradicate smallpox in the 1970s, was not immune. Not only did Henderson portray the polio campaign as stuck in neutral, he also saw it as a zero-sum game in which the effort was sapping resources better spent elsewhere. “Fighting polio has always had an emotional factor—the children in braces, the March of Dimes posters,” he &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/health/01polio.html" rel&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “But it doesn’t kill as many as measles. It’s not in the top 20.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/kennedy-rfk-jr-polio-eradication-public-health-vaccine?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"&gt;&lt;a class="button primary" href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/kennedy-rfk-jr-polio-eradication-public-health-vaccine?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Henderson’s complaints were echoed by others. “It’s theoretically possible to eradicate polio,” a WHO official &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/wipe-out-polio-experts-give-it-one-last-shot-flna1c9447651" rel&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “Whether or not we can do it is an entirely another matter.” Bioethicist Arthur Caplan, a polio survivor, went a step further, saying that eradication was neither feasible nor essential: “We ought to admit that the best we can achieve is control.” And Richard Horton, long-time editor-in-chief of the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt; Lancet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a leading medical journal, directed some withering criticism in Bill Gates’ direction. “[His] obsession with polio is distorting other priorities,” Horton said , adding: “Global health does not depend on polio eradication.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gates and his allies responded that any slowdown in the campaign would surely cause polio to spread, paralyzing and killing thousands of unvaccinated children. And Henderson did &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/15/health/15polio.html" rel&gt;change his mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; following conversations with his close friend, Dr. Ciro de Quadros, who had helped to eliminate smallpox and measles (temporarily) in parts of Africa and much of Latin America. What most impressed Henderson, he publicly admitted, was the ironclad commitment of Rotary International and especially the Gates Foundation to keep working and funding until the job was finished.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the twenty-first century now entering its second quarter, the battle to eradicate polio is still in flux. There have been some major victories—India has been polio-free for almost a decade, a monumental task—but civil strife, religious zealotry, the murder of vaccinators, and fear of Western motives and medicine in remote areas have continued to impede mass vaccination programs. To compound matters, the Sabin vaccine requires a minimum of four doses to confer adequate immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I FULLY UNDERSTAND THE SKEPTICISM toward eradication and the feeling that too much time, effort, and money have been directed toward a disease that pales, numerically, in comparison to other afflictions and public health problems. The global campaign to eradicate polio began with a burst of optimism that minimized or ignored dangerous hurdles, no doubt undermining its credibility. Over-promising is rarely a good idea, especially when that promise involves the elimination of an insidious childhood disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How close we are to fulfilling the mission remains in dispute. What is remarkable, however, is the tireless pursuit of the end game. Funding remains strong, the campaign continues to recruit millions of volunteers, and international cooperation, especially among Middle East and African nations, is clearly on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization, coupled with his elevation of RFK Jr., has no doubt hurt the global eradication cause. But Trump himself has sent mixed signals. He recently spoke of friends who have battled polio, while describing the Salk vaccine as “the greatest thing ever,” akin to a miracle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battle must continue. Giving up on eradication would be a sign of defeat virtually guaranteed to increase the number of worldwide polio cases while conceding to the arguments of anti-vaxxers that the disease is unworthy of mandatory vaccination anywhere, including the United States. For those of us old enough to remember the scourge of polio before Salk and Sabin, it’s a sobering thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/kennedy-rfk-jr-polio-eradication-public-health-vaccine?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"&gt;&lt;a class="button primary" href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/kennedy-rfk-jr-polio-eradication-public-health-vaccine?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Bulwark</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 10:29:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPdllXS0pDY0NkVTF6WnJNZHNsNzMwRUFRTEFlN0t2NEVydHByWEQ5eDctZkEwRDJMY3VMY1VxdUlMTURKaXJEZURDZ1UzU25YN1o1bDFoTkh6TDJCSlFlT2VMdkg2Q1RLejZOaVBZNi1kSWRDcXp6ZWU0RDB2RVJoTllMdUFrbFk5OUNN</guid></item><item><title>Noticing This While Watching TV Can Be An Early Sign Of Dementia - HuffPost UK</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxNUGhEMDFwbVRRdzZqQUxqOWxZa2lKWWxZV2cxNTQwMkd6ZkphWUdsWU95S042TnRUY3VxNW9wTGpNN0JvNlNmSjJfbVY5b0JDRmliNHQ4RVlaNW0zS1VNYllMaDdPZDFIeXI2aXprM2QzWnFKUDh1T0dNVi1adUNHaTdfZGVaclFlQWpBTkktOGdhV0lWd1gw0gGeAUFVX3lxTE15OGhYZ3lnU3R3RldVeXdIdG5lZ21SX1FpeHJDcjRZemlCeEc3R2pyQW5WY281dUYwWGM4bFFsSjdQSUE0WHN6MTlESEVzWW44MzBkX1BWVGp6c2ZZUDVBeHNCZTUxanZlMFpHbklnNFdVdTQ4c3ZtMlZXSGRINGF6WmlmT3h2bEZ2cWZ6VWhxSmU1WnRqbnR4OWhRc09R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though nearly a million people in the UK have dementia at the moment, &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/blog/how-many-people-have-dementia-uk" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Alzheimer’s Society" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67bc3b34e4b029e3b893ed2d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/blog/how-many-people-have-dementia-uk" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;Alzheimer’s Society&lt;/a&gt;

Probiotic supplements, which are typically sold over the counter, are reserved to treat specific ailments as suggested by your doctor. They are not recommended for everyday use. Plus, supplements do not have the same FDA oversight as medications do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, they noted the benefits of fermented foods: "Fermented foods, on the other hand, are an excellent natural source of probiotics. Fermenting is one of the oldest techniques for food preservation. Foods that are fermented go through a process of lactofermentation in which &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/health/164078/hair-loss-men-sugar-drinks-study"&gt;natural bacteria feed on the sugar and starch in the food&lt;/a&gt;, creating lactic acid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process of fermentation not only preserves food but also enhances its nutritional value, according to experts. They explained: "Another way to look at fermentation is that it takes one type of food and transforms it into another kind. For instance, cabbage becomes sauerkraut, cucumbers become pickles, soybeans turn into miso, and milk can be made into yoghurt, cheeses, and sour cream."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ovp-primis"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, they warned that not all fermented foods contain probiotics, as some processes like wine or beer production remove them, while others like canning and baking render them inactive, reports &amp;lt;a href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/harvard-health-experts-say-two-31051719" rel="Follow" target="_self"&amp;gt;Surrey Live&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specialists noted: "If there is a potential downside to fermented foods, it is that their taste and smell can be quite strong, which may be unpleasant for some people. The unique flavours and textures of fermented foods are due in part to the different species of bacteria used. On the upside, there are many types of fermented foods from which to choose, so there is a good chance you can find something you will enjoy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They listed yoghurt, kefir, kombucha, sauerkraut, pickles, miso, tempeh, kimchi, sourdough bread and some cheeses as common fermented foods that naturally contain probiotics or have them added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts tout yoghurt as the top choice for probiotic foods, palatable to Western taste buds. "Yoghurt is considered the go-to player of probiotic foods because it has a flavour and texture that are generally appealing to Western palates. The number and type of bacteria species can vary depending on the yoghurt brand. The probiotic content of yoghurt products can range from 90 billion to 500 billion CFU per serving. (CFU stands for colony-forming units, which is how many bacteria divide and form colonies.) Look for the words 'live and active cultures' on the label."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incorporating yoghurt into meals is a breeze, whether as a breakfast treat, snack, or a mayo substitute in salads and baking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's easy to add yoghurt to your diet. Besides having it for breakfast or a midday snack, you can substitute yogurt whenever you use mayonnaise in egg salad or potato salad, or in almost any baking recipe. Yogurt also can be the basis for sauces, salad dressings, or marinades."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, with no set daily intake for probiotics, they advise, "just add as many fermented foods to your daily diet as possible".

It found that about one in nine U.S. residents used supplements to enhance their immune systems between January 2017 and March 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“It comes up all the time,” said Dr. Michael Ben-Aderet, the associate medical director of hospital epidemiology at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles who wasn’t involved with the study. “There’s really this sense of people trying to optimize their health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Many people also used the supplements without a doctor’s recommendation, the researchers found. But infectious disease doctors, researchers, and supplement experts say there isn’t much evidence that these products actually help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-6b0900dc"&gt;What does the science say?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Supplements claiming to support immunity often contain vitamins and minerals necessary for the immune system.

&lt;p&gt;They intended for their work to be the subject of academic discussion and to spur further study of what they dubbed “post-vaccination syndrome.” Instead, it has exploded online — and become a parable for the ways in which the internet is being used to weaponize basic vaccine research vital to advancing scientific knowledge about the safe use of these key products.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study was released last Tuesday on medRxiv, a so-called preprint server where unpublished studies can be shared before they go through peer review, the process by which other scientists kick the tires, effectively, to help journals decide whether or not submitted research deserves to be published. The senior authors of the paper, immunologist Akiko Iwasaki and cardiologist Harlan Krumholz, both serious scientists, were clear in the press release they issued and interviews with STAT that these are preliminary findings that need much more study. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They both also insisted that they felt a responsibility to their patients to share what they are seeing, in the hopes it would prompt other researchers to investigate, figure out how to make safer Covid vaccines if there truly is a link, and, hopefully, find ways to help people affected by any such condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I just saw people suffering and thought we should follow the science,” said Krumholz, founder of the Yale School of Medicine’s Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation. He stressed he continues to get Covid booster shots, and doesn’t think people should “overindex” what he, Iwasaki, and their co-authors are reporting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think it’s ready to be used in clinical decision-making. So, if anything, I’m just trying to tell people: This shouldn’t be factoring into your decision right now.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is not the message the internet is hearing — or at least the parts of it where people routinely challenge the safety of vaccines. There, news of this paper “is spreading like wildfire,” one critic of the work, Adam Gaffney, an assistant professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Harvard Medical School, noted in &lt;a href="https://x.com/awgaffney/status/1892935347136278841" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a critique&lt;/a&gt; on the social media platform X. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere on X — and beyond — it was held up as proof that millions of people who believe they are suffering lingering illness from Covid infection were actually injured by the vaccine instead. (Many people with long Covid developed the condition before vaccines for the virus were developed.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, and the owner of X, reposted one such claim to his 218.7 million followers. Right-wing influencer Benny Johnson seized on the study as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We tried to warn you. This is completely horrifying,” Johnson said, also on X. “Studies are beginning to prove that the COVID Jab is far worse than COVID — and may in fact be a deadly poison for your immune system. Thousands of people need to go to jail.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One researcher, whose university — like a number right now — has told its academics to stay out of media coverage of political events, expressed exasperation at the scientists behind the study, asking: “Why on earth would you do this now if this is preliminary?” Post-vaccination syndrome “is a term that RFK will love,” this individual said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fact that the broadness of the term could be read to encompass vaccines other than Covid shots, even though the paper only investigated the role Covid shots might be playing in the illness it describes, was also seen by some as a concern. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The term is a problem, it’s a real problem, especially at this political moment,” said Gaffney, who believes the study has multiple shortcomings. “We’re at a moment right now where the U.S. government is undercutting people’s trust in science and vaccinations probably like never before in history. And to coin this novel syndrome without even proving that it’s caused by the vaccine is very worrisome to me.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;RFK, obviously, is the new secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a long-time critic of vaccines who has &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/22/trump-hhs-secretary-pick-rfk-jr-financial-disclosures-biotech-investments-book-advances/"&gt;earned substantial income&lt;/a&gt; for years speaking and publishing about perceived dangers of vaccines, and bringing vaccine injury lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The paper was posted to medRxiv during Kennedy’s first week at the helm of HHS, when there were &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/"&gt;already signs&lt;/a&gt; that policies promoting vaccines would come under attack. A meeting of a key vaccine advisory group long scheduled for this week &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/acip-cdc-vaccine-meeting-postponed/"&gt;was postponed&lt;/a&gt;, with a new date TBD. There were reports Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/kennedy-prepares-shakeup-of-vaccine-advisers-00205223" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;is about to fire&lt;/a&gt; some or all of the existing members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, giving him a chance to name new members to the committee. As it currently stands, Kennedy would not have &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/31/vaccine-policy-acip-members-appointees-hhs/"&gt;openings to fill&lt;/a&gt; on ACIP before 2027. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Into the roiling cauldron of unease about the future of U.S. vaccination policy dropped the Yale paper, comparing a range of biomarkers from 42 previously healthy people who are believed to have developed symptoms after getting a Covid shot to 22 still healthy individuals. Though it’s not yet known whether all the people studied are suffering from the same condition, there seemed to be at least a temporal association between getting vaccinated and developing symptoms like exercise intolerance, excessive fatigue, tinnitus, and brain fog, among others. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most of the people complaining of the symptoms developed them after their first or second Covid shot, though some experienced onset after a third, and in a few cases, a fourth dose of vaccine. There were cases among people who received most of the vaccines used in the U.S. — Pfizer’s, Moderna’s, and a Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine, which was briefly available but &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/coronavirus-covid-19-cber-regulated-biologics/janssen-covid-19-vaccine" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;was withdrawn by the company&lt;/a&gt; in 2023.  &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Oh, no! Really?” groaned an evidently dismayed Iwasaki, when told Musk had amplified a post on X alleging the study proved long Covid is caused by Covid vaccines. “I don’t want anyone to conflate the two different syndromes in one bucket. That is not the message we’re trying to convey.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The incident is a textbook example of something that plagues vaccine safety researchers: a damned-if-they-do-and-damned-if-they-don’t phenomenon. If researchers see evidence that use of a vaccine might be causing harm, they are ethically required to report it and pursue study of it. But public discussion of so-called signals of possible vaccine side effects are quickly weaponized by anti-vaccine forces. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is not uncommon for such signals to turn out to be false alarms, disproven by rigorous study. In the first couple of years after the H1N1 flu pandemic of 2009, there appeared to be &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2017/09/13/flu-vaccine-pregnancy-miscarriage/"&gt;higher-than-expected rates of miscarriage&lt;/a&gt; among pregnant people vaccinated against the new virus, though only among those who had received the shot in back-to-back years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funded a study to explore the issue over three flu seasons. The conclusion was that the earlier findings had been a statistical anomaly; &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/02/27/new-study-finds-no-link-between-flu-shots-and-miscarriages-allaying-fears/"&gt;there was no increased risk&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X19312447?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;resulting study&lt;/a&gt; was published in the journal Vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some safety signals, however, do prove to be true. The first rotavirus vaccine, to prevent a diarrheal and vomiting disease that afflicts young children, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2094741/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;was withdrawn from the market&lt;/a&gt; when it was linked to an increased risk of developing intussusception, a serious bowel blockage. And the CDC and its vaccine advisory panel have taken &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/06/26/cdc-rsv-acip-hearing/"&gt;a go-slow approach&lt;/a&gt; with RSV vaccines for older adults, because of an apparent increased risk of developing Guillain-Barré syndrome after vaccination. GBS is a neurological condition involving muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis. Most people fully recover, but some sustain permanent nerve damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To conceal possible side effects would be morally wrong and could endanger the health of people who take vaccines to prevent illness. Vaccine safety researchers do what Krumholz and Iwasaki did — they follow the science. But in doing so, and in talking about possible links between receipt of a vaccine and negative side effects before an association is found to be real could be perceived as casting aspersions on individual vaccines and vaccines in general.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Edward Belongia, who was the senior author on both the studies exploring whether vaccination with H1N1-containing shots was elevating the risk of miscarriage in pregnant people, said people who research vaccine safety are well aware of the possibility their work could be used to undermine people’s willingness to get vaccinated or to vaccinate their children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Absolutely. We know it gets weaponized and it’s very, very hard to fight that,” said Belongia, who is a senior research scientist doing vaccine research and infectious disease epidemiology at the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Science is at a disadvantage against them because they can take little bits of information and distort it, twist it, oversimplify it, and for the general public that doesn’t really know much about science or how this works, it sounds concerning,” he said. “[But] there are all sorts of reasons why what we’re seeing … might not be real.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alison Buttenheim, a professor of nursing at the University of Pennsylvania who studies vaccine acceptance and hesitancy, said it’s critically important that vaccine researchers follow the leads that emerge, regardless of whether the outcome exonerates or implicates a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She finds it reassuring to know this work is being done. But Buttenheim noted that science literacy among Americans is generally not high, and people don’t understand that science is an iterative process. “We live in a world where people are really uncomfortable with the idea that science evolves,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The increased tendency to release papers as preprints, before they’ve been vetted, is adding to the public relations challenges for vaccine safety research, said Belongia, though he noted that getting information out quickly, so that other researchers could build off new findings, was of critical importance during the Covid pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Iwasaki said the group grappled with the question of whether to post the paper to medRxiv, or to wait for it to go through peer review. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think about this every day,” she said. “But we opted to share this data in preprint because first, the publication process usually takes a while, and patients are suffering every day. And we didn’t want to wait until something is published to share this information with the patients … because most of them have been completely ignored.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Krumholz concurred. “We did debate it a lot,” he said. “In the end, the information about it was getting out by the grapevine and we thought better to preprint it as it was going through peer review. And we have had experience with journals not wanting to publish information about vaccine adverse effects — and we do not know how long it might take to publish it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Belongia said there’s no easy answer to the question of what vaccine researchers who find themselves in such situations should do. The work must continue, and the public has a right to be kept abreast of signals and the ultimate findings — transparency is critical to maintaining the public’s faith in vaccines, he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, that transparency will be used against the field, Belongia admitted. “I don’t know the solution in terms of how to deal with this and maintain public trust in an environment where any sort of measured voice that reflects the uncertainty of what we’re looking at is drowned out by the chorus of misinformation and disinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But with vapes, you just keep going and it's much harder to know how many puffs you've had. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's much easier to vape continuously because you can do it in places where smoking might be less acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What we have found is the dangers for someone who keeps vaping are no different from smokers.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-7d2499e0-cd16-11ef-b756-1d55513ec566"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; chiefs insisting it is safer than smoking, experts have long said vaping is not risk-free. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;E-cigarettes contain harmful toxins and their long-term effects remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have expressed fears there could be a wave of lung disease, dental issues and even &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-8ef7edb0-2812-11ef-8888-cd6a079abb92" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; in the coming decades in people who took up the habit at a young age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, researchers tracked volunteers, aged 27 on average all of whom had a similar level of fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were given regular stress tests to measure the elasticity of their blood vessels and the speed of blood flow to their brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Campaigners have long blamed predatory manufacturers for the ever-growing crisis, claiming they are intentionally luring kids in with colourful packaging, compared to highlighter pens, and child-friendly flavours such as bubblegum and cotton candy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For 12 hours prior to each test, they consumed only water and desisted from vaping, smoking and exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr Boidin, the mediated dilation (FMD) test — where in which a cuff is placed on the participant's arm to measure how much the artery expands as more blood is passed through it — produced the starkest results on vaping's effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both smokers and vapers achieved a flat reading, signalling they had damaged artery walls that can no longer dilate - an almost certain sign of future serious cardiovascular problems, Dr Boidin added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further tests proved that the blood flow in smokers and vapers is similarly impaired, making them at risk of developing cognitive dysfunction, including dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'When you put this mixture of metals and chemicals into your body you can't expect nothing to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'The only benefit of vaping is to help people quit smoking, but if they keep vaping the result is going to be the same. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I think doctors should be able to prescribe vapes for a certain time, so they could be used as a transition tool, but only for a short time.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13267453/health-complications-linked-vaping.html"&gt;MailOnline also discovered&lt;/a&gt; the number of adverse side effects linked to vaping reported to UK regulators has now eclipsed 1,000, with five of them fatal.&lt;/p&gt;

around a fifth of people globally at some point in their lives&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planned Parenthood provides a wide range of reproductive healthcare-related &lt;a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/get-care/our-services" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;services&lt;/a&gt;, from sex education and prenatal care to infertility services, and treatment for STDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/other/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; services include vaccinations, &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/tumor-operation-on-hold-covid-patients-taking-all-hospital-beds/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; screenings, birth control, &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/topics/mental-health" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; services, postpartum services, as well as wellness and preventative care, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protests outside of Planned Parenthood aren’t anything new. Not every American agrees with the services provided at these clinics. However, for millions of other people, these clinics provide essential care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case in point, the author of the viral post was able to get tested for ovarian cancer at Planned Parenthood while she was “between insurances.” Luckily, her tests came back negative. At the time of writing, the woman’s post had been upvoted 20k times and had garnered over 360 comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer is pervasive &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/topics/around-the-world" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;around the world&lt;/a&gt;. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2022, there were 20 million new cancer cases and 9.7 million cancer-related deaths globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/01-02-2024-global-cancer-burden-growing--amidst-mounting-need-for-services" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that around a fifth of people develop cancer in their lifetime. Meanwhile, 1 in 12 women and 1 in 9 men die from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most commonly occurring cancers include: lung cancer (12.4% of all new cases), female &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/topics/breast-cancer" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; (11.6%), colorectal cancer (9.6%), prostate cancer (7.3%), and stomach cancer (4.9%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Keep an eye out for changes in your body and health and don’t be scared of reaching out to a medical professional for some tests&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/data/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/dcpc/data/index.htm" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that in the &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/topics/united-states" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, nearly 1.78 million new cancer cases were reported. In 2022, over 608k Americans lost their lives due to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, the sooner you know that you may have cancer, the better your chances of treatment and survival. That’s why it’s so important to get regular screenings and to get in touch with your doctor if you have worrying symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ovarian-cancer/symptoms/index.html" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;warns&lt;/a&gt; that ovarian cancer may cause the following signs and symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vaginal bleeding (particularly if you are past menopause), or discharge from your v****a that is not normal for you;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pain or pressure in the pelvic area;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Abdominal or back pain;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bloating;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling full too quickly, or having difficulty eating;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A change in your bathroom habits, such as a more frequent or urgent need to urinate and/or constipation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have unusual bleeding, see a doctor immediately. Meanwhile, if you have any of the other signs for 2+ weeks, go see your doctor. These signs may not mean that you necessarily have cancer, you may have other health problems, but you won’t know until you get tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had a &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/husband-leaves-lunch-wifes-tumor-surgery-goes-wrong/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;cancer scare&lt;/a&gt;, dear Pandas?

"Going to bed early and getting high-quality sleep is a game changer for energy levels, focus, motivation, and overall feeling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and her husband, Warren Lentz, wind down for the night by watching TV and cuddling. They go to bed at 8:30 p.m. most nights.&lt;/p&gt;

In a 2024 study published in the Journal of Biophotonics, researchers found that red light appeared to improve the performance of mitochondria in the body — but there's no proof this leads to overall better energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barnes-Lentz has also &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C3lxFZqp_78/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on Instagram about how she uses red light therapy to reduce skin aging and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has shown some potential for improving the appearance of skin, such as reducing scars, acne, and wrinkles, but more research is needed to guarantee that it's effective, according to the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people buy $150,000 &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-execs-buying-red-light-therapy-beds-hyperbaric-chambers-wellness-2023-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;red light therapy beds&lt;/a&gt; or do red light therapy treatments at spas or medical centers.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your daily magnesium needs depend on factors like your age and gender. Adult males need 400-420 milligrams of magnesium per day, and adult females require 310-400 milligrams per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nearly half of the United States population falls short of their daily magnesium intake needs, which can increase their risk of conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/heart-disease-causes-7094403" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Eating more magnesium-rich foods, like fruit, can help boost magnesium intake.
