            An estimated 14.3 million children globally remain completely unvaccinated, according to a new report, and public health experts point to conflict zones as threatening childhood vaccination efforts worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000a3b6nke2aenyo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Each year, the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund publish a comprehensive report on estimates of national immunization coverage, based on data from 195 countries. This year’s report, released Monday, says there have been some improvements in protecting children against certain diseases through routine vaccinations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000c3b6nut62ppb8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Globally, 171,000 fewer children remained unvaccinated last year than in 2023, according to the report. But that still leaves more than 14 million children vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases and an additional 5.7 million with only partial protection because they may not have gotten all the recommended doses of certain vaccine series.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The latest estimates highlight a really concerning trajectory,” Dr. Kate O’Brien, director of WHO’s Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals, said in a news briefing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The global vision is for everyone everywhere to benefit from lifesaving vaccines,” she said. “But we’ve hit this very stubborn glass ceiling, and breaking through that glass to protect more children against vaccine-preventable diseases is becoming more difficult.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000f3b6n91yn05y3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rising conflicts and war zones emerging around the world have eroded some of the progress in providing children with immunizations, she added, leading to many children remaining unvaccinated, especially in low- or middle-income countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000g3b6nagwvegl6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Children living in one of 26 countries affected by fragility, conflict or humanitarian emergencies are three times more likely to be unvaccinated compared to children who live in stable countries,” O’Brien said. “In fact, half of all children unvaccinated in the world live in these fragile, vulnerable and conflict countries.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000h3b6nz26p4hqu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new report says that last year, nine countries – Nigeria, India, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Yemen, Afghanistan and Angola – accounted for 52% of all children who have never received a dose of vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000j3b6ntw95iffc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Meanwhile, mostly in high-income countries, vaccine coverage has been affected by vaccine hesitancy and distrust in institutions, leading to a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases including measles and polio, said Dr. Ephrem Lemango, UNICEF’s associate director for health and global chief of immunization.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000k3b6niclvxt53@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Based on all we know, over the past 50 years, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/24-04-2024-global-immunization-efforts-have-saved-at-least-154-million-lives-over-the-past-50-years" target="_blank"&gt;over 150 million lives were saved through vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, and this has been able to protect children from any forms of vaccine-preventable diseases,” Lemango said at the briefing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000l3b6nze3nadqo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But misinformation and any forms of vaccine hesitance is a reflection of a broader lack of trust or mistrust in the systems that deliver the vaccines, in the health workers that provide the vaccines and in the manufacturing facilities or the ecosystems that manufacture the vaccines,” he said. “So it is important to see misinformation or lack of information as part of a broader ecosystem to be able to address.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000m3b6nkl15urlu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Misinformation appears to be driving outbreaks of disease in pockets of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;countries that tend to have high vaccination rates, O’Brien said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000n3b6nujg1soyh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are communities sort of hidden under that national number that have very low vaccination coverage, and that’s where outbreaks are happening, and those children are the ones who are suffering,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hag3m00003b6ndbds8mcg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the United States, a measles outbreak that originated in a part of West Texas that has a low vaccination rate continues to spread, and there have been more measles cases reported in the US this year than any other since the disease was declared eliminated a quarter-century ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000o3b6nw2oij7ua@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But O’Brien added that while the effects of misinformation remain concerning, they are not the main reason millions of children remain unvaccinated globally.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000p3b6nu4mxj23e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The main reason, when you look worldwide, why children aren’t vaccinated is because of access to vaccines and access to vaccination services – and this is where it’s particularly important,” O’Brien said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000q3b6naqqed164@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’re not being vaccinated because they don’t have access,” she said. “They’re in dangerous settings, it’s hard to gain access to them, and in some situations, the government does not have access to those environments.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000s3b6ny6x939sh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new report comes amid growing concern about funding for global vaccination efforts. The Trump administration has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/30/politics/bush-obama-trump-usaid"&gt;dismantled the US Agency for International Development&lt;/a&gt;, or USAID, which has partnered with organizations like Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance to provide vaccines. And the US has announced plans to reduce funding for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000t3b6nak8u37mf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We still have a lot of work to do,” WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a news release. “Drastic cuts in aid, coupled with misinformation about the safety of vaccines, threaten to unwind decades of progress. WHO remains committed to working with our partners to support countries to develop local solutions and increase domestic investment to reach all children with the lifesaving power of vaccines.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000v3b6n8bypac94@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new report says that in 2024, protection against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis remained constant, as an estimated 89% of infants globally received at least one dose of the DTP vaccine, the same share as in 2023 and 2022. Roughly 85% completed all three recommended doses of vaccine last year, compared to 84% in 2023 and 85% in 2022.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000x3b6nzcdkofgs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The percentage of children receiving their first dose of measles vaccine remained relatively constant last year, at 84%, compared to 83% in 2023 and 2022. But that share is lower than in 2019, when coverage was 86%, according to the new report. Overall, the report says, 20.6 million children missed their routine first dose of measles vaccine last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx00103b6nq21fumza@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Meanwhile, the global percentage of children receiving their second dose of measles vaccine increased from 73% in 2022 and 74% in 2023 to 76% in 2024, according to the new report.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx000z3b6nrz5bniw7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the United States, childhood vaccine coverage has been declining, and the vast majority of measles cases this year – more than 90% – have been in people who were unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx00133b6nxqmvsoct@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The good news is that we have managed to reach more children with life-saving vaccines. But millions of children remain without protection against preventable diseases, and that should worry us all,” UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in the news release. “We must act now with determination to overcome barriers like shrinking health budgets, fragile health systems along with misinformation and access constraints because of conflicts. No child should die from a disease we know how to prevent.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx00143b6nuzdfuchb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            O’Brien said there has been “incredible improvement” in global coverage of the HPV vaccine, which helps protect against the human papillomavirus, which can cause cervical cancer and other related diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3j4tje002k3b6nu2a1cb3i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The percentage of girls receiving a first dose increased to 31% in 2024, from 27% in 2023 and 20% in 2022. The percentage receiving all the doses of vaccine recommended in their country increased to 28% in 2024, from 21% in 2023 and 14% in 2022, according to the new report.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx00173b6nnuud6nba@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HPV vaccine coverage was somewhat stable among boys, with 8% receiving a first dose in 2024 and 2023.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx00193b6nyfwc1jve@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is a real bright spot in the data that, again, year on year now, we’re seeing increases in HPV vaccine coverage,” O’Brien said, adding that recent increases are largely attributable to the introduction of the vaccine in Nigeria, Bangladesh and four other countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx001a3b6nuobcr0m0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, the new report shows that although there hasn’t been a significant retreat in childhood vaccine coverage globally, there hasn’t been significant improvement either, said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, who was not involved in the report.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3hcejx001b3b6nx7j94c0d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Fourteen million children who have received no vaccines is 14 million too many. Childhood vaccination is one of the most cost-effective medical interventions that’s ever been developed,” Barouch said. “I would hope that global health authorities prioritize childhood vaccination programs and that funding mechanisms are developed to ensure the continuation of these programs.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

hxuGS"&gt;Launched in 2003, UK Biobank is one of the largest collections of biological samples and health data in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In total, half a million people – all middle-aged volunteers – have been asked to complete physical tests, answer regular health and lifestyle questions, and provide DNA and other biological samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Their blood, urine and saliva are frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at temperatures of -80C (-112F) in huge refrigerators in Stockport, Greater Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The imaging part of the project began in 2014, and involves taking detailed scans of 100,000 of those same participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;All of that group will be invited back to repeat the process every few years to see how their bodies and organs change as they grow older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;By combining those scans with the other data collected by UK Biobank, scientists can test whether early changes to the make-up of the brain or body then lead to diseases or other health problems in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The whole UK Biobank project, which is non-profit making, was set up by the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust charity, along with the Department of Health and the Scottish government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Two decades later it is now reaching maturity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Over 30 petabytes, or 30,000 terabytes, of anonymised health data is already available to researchers working for universities, charities, governments and the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Scientists in the UK and the rest of the world can apply for access and most are charged between £3,000 and £9,000 to help cover running costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Louise Thomas, professor of metabolic imaging at the University of Westminster, says it is "completely transforming" how she and other researchers do their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We thought it was a crazy idea, there was absolutely no way anybody could scan this number of people," she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"To analyse these images manually would have taken us thousands of years but now... we can extract all the information automatically, so we can measure everything in the body in a matter of minutes." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Researchers are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) to process the huge amounts of data generated by the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Almost 1,700 peer-reviewed papers have been written using all types of Biobank data since work started in 2003, with dozens more now published every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The scans and images taken so far have already been used to show that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;UK Biobank is one of the 10 largest stores of personal health data in the world alongside similar initiatives in Germany, China and the United States, although those projects don't all make their data available to scientists globally in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The imaging element of the project is also funded by a number of other organisations including the British Heart Foundation, Calico, a subsidiary of Alphabet which also owns Google, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, established by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 23:40:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"

    Dr. Jamin Brahmbhatt is a urologist and robotic surgeon with Orlando Health and an assistant professor at the University of Central Florida’s College of Medicine.
&lt;/p&gt;

            When most of us think about sugar, I bet we’re not thinking about our sex lives. We’re thinking about dessert. I’m writing this with the help of a bowl of vanilla ice cream by my side.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3k000o356nvmokxbq7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sugar makes us feel good in the moment, but over time, too much of it may cause us to lose out on some of life’s most intimate moments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3k000p356n2n6me7np@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2025, everyone’s been buzzing about GLP-1 injections to help control sugar and lose weight. This new class of medication has helped many achieve meaningful health gains — including improved blood sugar, weight loss — and even improvements to people’s sex lives (because they could be getting better sleep, too).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3k000q356nhpzffsj2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            My goal here isn’t to discount the use of GLP-1 drugs or suggest people are taking them unnecessarily (although some people may be). My intent is to spark a broader conversation: What if we also paid more attention to the root cause: our love for sugar and its downstream effects on mood, metabolism, sex and more?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l000r356n74atmdxp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most people associate blood sugar with diabetes, but few know what is “normal.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l000s356nwuydi1zl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Blood sugar levels can be checked in real time with a simple finger stick, via home glucose monitor or through wearable devices such as continuous glucose monitors (those coin-size devices you may see on people’s upper arms), which provide feedback on glucose levels throughout the day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l000t356nyc6l4kuu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What do we see when this test is done? Following is the American Diabetes Association &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/diagnosis" target="_blank"&gt;range of reference&lt;/a&gt; for blood glucose levels, but they are not meant for you to diagnose yourself with diabetes. In many instances, your provider may double- or even triple-check these numbers before labeling you with “diabetes.”

            All numbers should be evaluated by your health care provider.

            The point-of-care glucose test gives a snapshot, but there’s one lab that tells the full story — the hemoglobin A1c.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmd3fuy6f001p356nv4x6r7we@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="what-is-hemoglobin-a1c-and-why-does-it-matter" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        What is hemoglobin A1c, and why does it matter?
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l0012356nd39hm2nk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This blood test measures the percentage of hemoglobin proteins in your blood that have glucose attached to it — giving you and your health care providers a picture of your average blood sugar over the past two to three months. This makes it a reliable indicator of how well your body manages glucose over time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Here’s how the &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/diagnosis" target="_blank"&gt;American Diabetes Association&lt;/a&gt; breaks it down:
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/list/instances/cmd3fvv8f001y356nl9ci8ndq@published" class="list-elevate vossi-list" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Normal: A1c below 5.7%
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.1.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Prediabetes: 5.7% to 6.4%
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.2.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Diabetes: 6.5% or higher
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l0017356ncqvjtrp0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In my work as a surgeon, checking A1c before any procedure — especially those involving implants — is standard practice. Elevated A1c levels are strongly linked to poor recovery, infection risks and surgical complications. So, whether it’s a major urologic procedure or something else, keeping your glucose in check matters more than most people realize.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l0018356ngpoesmus@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sexual health is rarely the first thing people associate with blood sugar, but chronically high glucose levels can have an impact on intimacy — for everyone.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l0019356nzt4d1wzh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In men, high blood sugar can damage the nerves and blood vessels essential for achieving and maintaining erections. Over time, this can present as erectile dysfunction, before a man is ever diagnosed with or thought to be at risk for diabetes. High blood sugar can also &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/08/health/low-testosterone-wellness"&gt;lower testosterone&lt;/a&gt; levels, which then reduce libido and energy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001a356nyevrg4r8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many of my patients who do not get routine screenings from their primary care providers come to see me because of changes in sexual performance — only to later discover their blood sugar is out of control. For these patients, their first clue that something was wrong wasn’t thirst, weight changes or fatigue (the more common early signs of diabetes) — it was trouble in the bedroom.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001b356nmmimv0wq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In women, high blood sugar can lead to reduced blood flow and hormone imbalances, which may cause vaginal dryness, painful sex or problems with orgasm. It can also increase the risk of recurrent urinary tract infections, which can make intimacy painful or less appealing. Many women can feel frustrated and confused about whether these changes are expected from aging, post-menopause, stress or something else. A poor sugar level is usually the last thing on their mind.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001c356nf5bch2gv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Diabetes is incredibly common — &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/php/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;about 38 million Americans have it&lt;/a&gt; — and nearly 1 in 4 don’t even know it, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001d356nqiido2he@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Traditionally, diabetes treatment started with oral medications like metformin, which helps lower glucose by reducing sugar production in the liver. Other classes of pills work in different ways, either by increasing insulin release or helping the kidneys flush out excess sugar. These medications are typically prescribed for people in the earlier stages of diabetes or with mildly elevated A1c.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001e356nvmypf19m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Injectable medications may be necessary when oral pills aren’t enough to treat the disease. For years, that often meant daily insulin injections, which many patients found to be burdensome but necessary. Insulin needs to be carefully timed with meals, and dosing can be tricky. There’s also a real fear of low blood sugar episodes, which can make some people hesitant to start or stick with the therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001f356n73a8xxfz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Over the past few years, GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs have become part of many people’s treatment regimens. This class of medication is known by names like semaglutide, liraglutide and tirzepatide. These injections mimic a natural hormone in your body that helps regulate blood sugar, slows down digestion and make you feel fuller faster.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001g356nalmlvhjm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While they were originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes, they’ve gained worldwide attention for helping people lose weight. In fact, many patients now ask and get these medications before any other option — not just to manage blood sugar, but to lose weight.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001h356n7cbipkk7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These medications also may help normalize testosterone levels in men with obesity or type 2 diabetes, according to &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1090292" target="_blank"&gt;preliminary research&lt;/a&gt; presented at the Endocrine Society’s annual meeting this week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001i356nn9ip8uhu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers tracked 110 men who were prescribed GLP-1 injections but were not taking any testosterone therapy. Over the course of 18 months, as participants lost on average about 10% of their body weight, the number of men with normal testosterone levels increased from 53% to 77%. This rise highlights how medications originally designed for diabetes and weight loss also may improve hormone levels in men.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001j356nw944ibgc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While this abstract has not yet been peer-reviewed and more research is needed, these findings add to a growing body of evidence that managing weight and blood sugar can have ripple effects across nearly every aspect of health — including testosterone, energy and sexual function.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001k356n54t2azfj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Before turning immediately to medications, don’t underestimate what consistent lifestyle changes can do, not just for your blood sugar but for your whole life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001l356n1nq6p17l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Regular exercise improves insulin sensitivity, supports weight loss, boosts energy and even enhances sexual function by improving blood flow and hormone balance. A balanced diet — one that’s rich in whole foods, fiber and lean protein — can stabilize blood sugar and reduce inflammation that contributes to chronic disease. Better sleep, reduced alcohol and managing stress all play a role, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001m356n9lvbiwhl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So, if you’re debating between an injection or a new routine, maybe this time reach for the gym bag before you try anything else. You might just find it changes more than your labs. It might change how you feel about yourself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd3fuv3l001n356n0sgoj61k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As for me, the next time I help myself to that scoop of ice cream while writing, I’ll remember that it’s not just about my waistline — it’s about my energy, my heart and my sexual health. And now that I’m done with this article, I’ll pick up my gym bag and walk the walk (to the gym) that I’m talking here.
    &lt;/p&gt;

She suspected something more serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite being in excellent health, on a &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/veganism/index.html" id="mol-01356660-60fb-11f0-bfd1-65124ca6fb5b"&gt;vegan&lt;/a&gt; diet, with no family history of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-01328030-60fb-11f0-bfd1-65124ca6fb5b"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and normal bloodwork, she struggled to get answers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Multiple specialists, allergists, internists, and gastroenterologists, found nothing unusual. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She set an appointment for a colonoscopy in early 2015, something her doctor had recommended. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There, it appeared that what she had believed was a hemorrhoid for years looked more like polyps, abnormal growths of tissue that can turn cancerous. To be safe, she was referred to a colorectal surgeon for an MRI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was with her chiropractor, who helped her with her low abdominal pain, when she got the call. What the GI doctor initially believed was a benign polyp developed into malignant tumor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tracy Robert, a personal trainer and nutrition coach, was diagnosed with colon cancer at 40. She had been told for over 20 years that what doctors said were IBS symptoms were actually early signs of cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, about 10 percent of colon cancer cases are &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6306175/Bowel-cancer-rates-rise-younger-people-Europe.html"&gt;diagnosed in people under 50.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those numbers are rising about one to two percent each year, and researchers are still finding out why. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Robert was diagnosed with stage 2B to 3A colorectal cancer, indicating that the cancer had spread beyond the outermost layer of the colon into the rectum wall, she told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.self.com/story/tracy-robert-colorectal-cancer-hemorrhoids"&gt;Self&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors were set to surgically remove the mass, but first, she would have to take oral chemotherapy pills every day along with radiation treatments five days a week for three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The tumor was buried deep in her rectum, tangled around the sphincter muscles that control bowel movements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Surgeons had no choice but to divert her colon, bypassing her anus entirely, and bring it through her abdominal wall instead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, waste empties into a colostomy bag, a permanent fixture on her stomach. Adjusting to that was one of the most challenging parts of her cancer battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I felt like I lost my sexiness, like I lost my innocence,' she told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-colon-cancer-misdiagnosed-ibs-hemorrhoid-2025-3"&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;. 'That put me down a really dark hole.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Robert was diagnosed with stage 2B to 3A colorectal cancer, indicating that the cancer had spread beyond the outermost layer of the colon into the rectum wall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As a personal trainer who also did nutrition coaching, she worried about being judged for her colostomy bag: 'I felt a lot of shame around it and a lot of 'what did I do wrong?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a personal trainer who also did nutrition coaching, she worried about being judged for her colostomy bag: 'I felt a lot of shame around it and a lot of 'what did I do wrong?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A self-described 'eternal optimist,' Robert found herself unable to play the role of 'ray of sunshine' for her family. The toll was most evident in her sons, then just seven and nine, who left their own beds at night and clung to her instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was rediagnosed with stage 0 colorectal cancer after the surgery, meaning the cancer hadn't spread beyond the colon lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Post-surgery, Robert underwent several rounds of IV chemotherapy to eliminate any lingering cancer cells. But the treatment took a harsh toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her white blood cell counts repeatedly plummeted to dangerous lows, a common but risky side effect of chemo. Doctors advised cutting the regimen short, to great success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Follow-up scans showed no evidence of disease. Against the odds, she was cancer-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though she is cancer-free, Robert can't help but wonder if she would have a colostomy bag today had a GI specialist signed her up for a colonoscopy despite her being younger than the recommended age to start getting the annual exam, 45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If I could go back to my younger self, I would have asked for a colonoscopy. That could have changed everything,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Doctors would have been able to catch and remove the polyp early so it never would have grown into cancer, and I wouldn't have wound up using a colostomy bag to poop for the rest of my life.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Robert has since taken her story to TikTok in the hope of raising awareness about colorectal cancer in young people as young as 17.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This phenomenon has puzzled and alarmed scientists and doctors who point to a confluence of factors, including poor diet, obesity, processed diets, sedentary lifestyles, antibiotic overuse, and even environmental toxins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even if you live a healthy lifestyle, whatever that looks like to you: If you feel like something's wrong, or you're not getting clear answers about what's causing your symptoms, keep pushing for answers,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Just because a doctor thinks you have one thing, like a hemorrhoid, it doesn't necessarily mean that's the case—they're only human, and diagnostic tests don't always show the full picture.

She suspected something more serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite being in excellent health, on a &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/veganism/index.html" id="mol-01356660-60fb-11f0-bfd1-65124ca6fb5b"&gt;vegan&lt;/a&gt; diet, with no family history of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-01328030-60fb-11f0-bfd1-65124ca6fb5b"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and normal bloodwork, she struggled to get answers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Multiple specialists, allergists, internists, and gastroenterologists, found nothing unusual. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She set an appointment for a colonoscopy in early 2015, something her doctor had recommended. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There, it appeared that what she had believed was a hemorrhoid for years looked more like polyps, abnormal growths of tissue that can turn cancerous. To be safe, she was referred to a colorectal surgeon for an MRI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was with her chiropractor, who helped her with her low abdominal pain, when she got the call. What the GI doctor initially believed was a benign polyp developed into malignant tumor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tracy Robert, a personal trainer and nutrition coach, was diagnosed with colon cancer at 40. She had been told for over 20 years that what doctors said were IBS symptoms were actually early signs of cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, about 10 percent of colon cancer cases are &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6306175/Bowel-cancer-rates-rise-younger-people-Europe.html"&gt;diagnosed in people under 50.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those numbers are rising about one to two percent each year, and researchers are still finding out why. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Robert was diagnosed with stage 2B to 3A colorectal cancer, indicating that the cancer had spread beyond the outermost layer of the colon into the rectum wall, she told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.self.com/story/tracy-robert-colorectal-cancer-hemorrhoids"&gt;Self&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors were set to surgically remove the mass, but first, she would have to take oral chemotherapy pills every day along with radiation treatments five days a week for three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The tumor was buried deep in her rectum, tangled around the sphincter muscles that control bowel movements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Surgeons had no choice but to divert her colon, bypassing her anus entirely, and bring it through her abdominal wall instead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, waste empties into a colostomy bag, a permanent fixture on her stomach. Adjusting to that was one of the most challenging parts of her cancer battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I felt like I lost my sexiness, like I lost my innocence,' she told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-colon-cancer-misdiagnosed-ibs-hemorrhoid-2025-3"&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;. 'That put me down a really dark hole.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Robert was diagnosed with stage 2B to 3A colorectal cancer, indicating that the cancer had spread beyond the outermost layer of the colon into the rectum wall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As a personal trainer who also did nutrition coaching, she worried about being judged for her colostomy bag: 'I felt a lot of shame around it and a lot of 'what did I do wrong?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a personal trainer who also did nutrition coaching, she worried about being judged for her colostomy bag: 'I felt a lot of shame around it and a lot of 'what did I do wrong?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A self-described 'eternal optimist,' Robert found herself unable to play the role of 'ray of sunshine' for her family. The toll was most evident in her sons, then just seven and nine, who left their own beds at night and clung to her instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was rediagnosed with stage 0 colorectal cancer after the surgery, meaning the cancer hadn't spread beyond the colon lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Post-surgery, Robert underwent several rounds of IV chemotherapy to eliminate any lingering cancer cells. But the treatment took a harsh toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her white blood cell counts repeatedly plummeted to dangerous lows, a common but risky side effect of chemo. Doctors advised cutting the regimen short, to great success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Follow-up scans showed no evidence of disease. Against the odds, she was cancer-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though she is cancer-free, Robert can't help but wonder if she would have a colostomy bag today had a GI specialist signed her up for a colonoscopy despite her being younger than the recommended age to start getting the annual exam, 45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If I could go back to my younger self, I would have asked for a colonoscopy.

      &lt;p&gt;The human brain tends to lose a step as we age. Now, scientists want to minimize that decline by studying people with exceptional brains.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once we get past about age 40, even a healthy brain begins to lose a step or two. Reaction times get slower. It's harder to remember everything on your shopping list. But scientists are looking for ways to minimize these changes. NPR's Jon Hamilton reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: Memory lapses and slower thinking can be signs of a disease like Alzheimer's. But Matt Huentelman of the Translational Genomics Research Institute in Phoenix says usually they just mean someone's brain is getting older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MATT HUENTELMAN: Both of those things, memory and processing speed, change with age in a normal group of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Huentelman should know. He helps run MindCrowd, a free online cognitive test that's been taken by more than 700,000 people of all ages. Huentelman says about a thousand of those people had test scores indicating their brain was exceptional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HUENTELMAN: The way that we define an exceptional brain is someone who performs at a level that is about 30 years younger than them when it comes to a memory test or a processing speed test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Huentelman says good genes are one factor, but he and a team of researchers are looking for other differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HUENTELMAN: We want to study these exceptional performers because we think they can tell us what the rest of us should be doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Early results suggest that sleep and maintaining cardiovascular health are a good start. Huentelman was one of several dozen researchers who met in Miami this summer to discuss healthy brain aging. The event was hosted by the McKnight Brain Research Foundation. Another speaker was Dr. Christian Agudelo, a sleep neurologist at the University of Miami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHRISTIAN AGUDELO: I think the value of sleep and sleep deprivation became true to me when I had kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Agudelo's kids are 4 and 6 now. He says his own experience is consistent with his research on the relationship between sleep and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AGUDELO: The better you sleep, the better your brain health is going to be, both structurally and functionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Agudelo says the key is getting high-quality sleep, which allows the brain to cycle through all the sleep stages. Researchers can measure how well a person is sleeping by monitoring their brainwave patterns, but Agudelo says people usually know when they've had a good night's rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AGUDELO: You go to sleep, you wake up and you feel like that experience was worthwhile. You feel refreshed. And we all, hopefully, have experienced that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Ensuring high-quality sleep is tricky, but Agudelo says you can improve the odds with certain behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AGUDELO: Waking up at the same time every single day and aligning our sleep rhythms with the rhythm of the sun. Being active both socially and physically so we can fall asleep more easily and more deeply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Dr. Charles DeCarli, a neurologist at the University of California, Davis, says brain aging is also affected by vascular risk factors like blood pressure, cholesterol levels and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHARLES DECARLI: We tend to think about them as affecting the heart, sometimes the blood vessels in the legs or stroke, not so much as it impacts on the brain itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: But DeCarli's research on thousands of people 65 and older found a strong correlation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DECARLI: The size of the brain, the shape of the brain, the tissue integrity of the brain looks older in people who have these risk factors than those who do not have them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: So DeCarli and a team of researchers are studying whether it's possible to protect the brain by aggressively treating conditions that affect the circulatory system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DECARLI: The question is, if you have these diseases and they're well controlled, will you have a younger-looking brain? And the answer seems to be yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Researchers say other ways to keep your brain youthful include avoiding smoking, limiting alcohol and getting lots of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jon Hamilton, NPR News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00997" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new large study from Denmark&lt;/a&gt; directly counters those claims. After mining the vaccination and medical records of more than 1.2 million children over a 24-year period, researchers could see no evidence that exposure to aluminum in vaccines led to a statistically significant increase in a child’s risk of developing any of a wide variety of conditions that can be diagnosed in childhood, including asthma and autism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;None of the 50 conditions the group looked at — broadly categorized as relating to autoimmune diseases, allergy, and neurodevelopmental disorders — occurred at statistically higher levels than would be expected, ruling out moderate or substantially increased risk from exposure to aluminum in vaccines, a finding senior author Anders Hviid described as “quite striking.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We can exclude meaningful increases with a large degree of certainty for many of these outcomes,” Hviid, who heads the department of epidemiology research at the Statens Serum Institut, Denmark’s public health agency, told STAT in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We should not be concerned about aluminum used as an adjuvant in childhood vaccines. I think that’s the core message.” &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Hviid and his co-authors said that while there wasn’t a statistically significant increase seen for any of the conditions they studied, they could not rule out the possibility of a small increased risk for some very rare conditions. “So that tells us that clearly that there’s not an epidemic of chronic diseases in childhood’’ associated with aluminum in vaccines, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The article was published Monday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other experts agreed with Hviid’s take on the findings. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I was very encouraged by the data, particularly for asthma as I know vaccine hesitancy groups are concerned by this,” said Anna Durbin, director of the Center for Immunization Research at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Matthew Daley and Jason Glanz, two authors of an earlier &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/09/27/possible-link-aluminum-childhood-vaccines-asthma-risk-caveats/"&gt;U.S.-based study&lt;/a&gt; that suggested aluminum in childhood vaccines might be tied to an increased risk of developing asthma before age 5, also welcomed the publication. Daley and Glanz, both of whom work at Kaiser Permanente Colorado’s Institute for Health Research, both described the study as well done.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the issue of asthma risk in particular, Daley said this new study should provide reassurance to parents that vaccinating their children according to the recommended schedule should not increase their risk of developing asthma. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As a practicing pediatrician, I find that reassuring, and my patients and other clinicians I work with should find that reassuring,” said Daley, who noted that even after publishing his study about the possible association between aluminum in vaccines and asthma, he continued to urge parents to vaccinate their children, because he felt the benefits of vaccination were greater than the small possible risk his work identified.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aluminum salts are added to some pediatric vaccines to improve the immune response they stimulate. They are used in inactivated vaccines — vaccines made from killed viruses or bacteria — and protein-based vaccines. Vaccines that use live but weakened viruses, such as the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, do not contain aluminum, nor do &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/21/mrna-vaccines-safety-efficacy-senate-committee-probe-myocarditis-adverse-events-covid-shots/"&gt;vaccines made using messenger RNA&lt;/a&gt;, like several of the Covid-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aluminum salts have been used for more than 70 years, and there is a large body of evidence supporting their safety and effectiveness. But they have attracted the attention of opponents of vaccines, who argue they may overstimulate immune systems. The amount of aluminum that children are exposed to through vaccines is well below accepted safe limits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daley and his co-authors undertook their study after a 2013 report on vaccine safety from the Institute of Medicine — which has since been renamed the National Academy of Medicine — urged additional research of whether there might be a link between exposure to aluminum in vaccines and the development of asthma. After their &lt;a href="https://els-jbs-prod-cdn.jbs.elsevierhealth.com/pb/assets/raw/Health%20Advance/journals/acap/Aluminium_Exposure_Article-1664288052690.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;results were published in the journal Academic Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; in 2023, Hviid and his colleagues in Denmark were inspired to take another look. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I feel a sense of gratitude that they undertook this study,” Daley said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigating the safety of aluminum in vaccines is challenging because aluminum is ubiquitous — it’s the third-most abundant element on the planet, Glanz said. Humans encounter it daily, in food, for instance. It is even found in breast milk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hviid and colleagues from the Statens Serum Institut and from the University of Copenhagen used Denmark’s nationwide health care registries to compile a cohort of 1.2 million children born between 1997 and 2018, checking for diagnoses for 50 conditions. They examined the records of the children out to 5 years of age.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because the number of vaccines given in early childhood changed over the 24-year study period, the researchers were able to determine whether rates of any of these conditions changed as the amount of aluminum children received via vaccinations increased when new vaccines were added to the schedule. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That they didn’t see differences among children who received more vaccines in early childhood is a strength of the study, Daley said. That’s because if something causes a biological effect, receiving more of the substance should exacerbate the effect. It’s a phenomenon referred to as a dose response.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“They don’t see any dose response there at all. And their study was set up to see a dose response if one was there,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daley noted a few caveats in interpreting the results, pointing out that the vaccine schedule in Denmark is slightly different from the one used in the United States.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They immunize at 3 months, 5 months, 12 months. We immunize at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 12 months. I would be surprised that that slight difference between 2 and 3 months would make a big difference. But it is important to acknowledge that there is a difference we should keep in mind,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Likewise, this isn’t a randomized controlled trial; researchers were not comparing children who received no aluminum-containing vaccines to children who did get shots containing aluminum. Such a study would not be ethical to conduct because withholding vaccines from some children would put them at risk of serious illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the size of this study and the clear-cut nature of the results underscores the safety of these critical vaccines, Hviid said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines are really important for our immunization programs. Not just in Denmark, not just in the U.S., but globally,” he said. “We don’t have any replacements for these vaccines with other adjuvants. So if you take them away, children are going to die.”&lt;/p&gt;

Scientists identified a subset of neurons in the prefrontal cortex that integrate oxytocin, ovarian hormones, and social cues to modulate sexual receptivity in females and suppress mating interest in males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activating these neurons made non-fertile females receptive, while silencing them during estrus stopped their interest, with opposite effects in males. The findings show how identical brain circuits can produce dramatically different behaviors in males and females depending on hormonal states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hormone-Responsive Circuit:&lt;/strong&gt; Cacna1h+ neurons in the prefrontal cortex control sociosexual behaviors by integrating oxytocin and ovarian hormone signals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex-Specific Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Activating the circuit boosts mating interest in females but suppresses it in males.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Feedback:&lt;/strong&gt; The neurons both drive and are activated by mating-related social interactions, showing a feedback loop.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Rockefeller University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In animals with social structures, the drive to reproduce is a complex process; governed by the brain, it’s influenced by both internal cues such as hormones and external factors such as interactions with potential mates.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One area long known to play a critical role is the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Located just behind the forehead, this node governs various aspects of social behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent paper in &lt;em&gt;Cell, &lt;/em&gt;researchers at Rockefeller University’s Laboratory of Molecular Biology, led by Nathaniel Heintz, have determined how a subregion of the PFC influences the reproductive drive in mice: through a hormonally primed cortical circuit that controls how and when female mice seek to mate with males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The circuit, which connects to multiple layers of the brain, is stimulated by both the “love hormone” oxytocin and ovarian hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The circuit integrates hormonal states with the recognition of potential mates to orchestrate complex cognitive behaviors,” says Ines Ibañez-Tallon, research associate professor in the lab and co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, male mice also have this circuit, but its activation has the opposite effect in them: they become less interested in mating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This shared circuitry is flexibly sculpted by both hormonal state and biological sex to produce sex-specific patterns of social behavior,” says senior co-author Kun Li, a former Ph.D. student in the lab and now an associate professor in the School of Life Sciences at Tsinghua University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It could help explain why sexual motivation and social interest fluctuate across reproductive states and differ between sexes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sexual dimorphism in the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper builds upon earlier findings from the lab. In 2014, the researchers discovered a new type of brain cell in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that they dubbed oxytocin receptor-expressing neurons (OxtrINs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin is a hormone linked to bonding of all kinds—maternal, familial, romantic, social. In mice, the team found, the OxtrINs cortical circuit promoted receptivity to mating—but only in females, and only during estrus, or the fertile period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intrigued by the idea that a cell type identical in male and female mice could affect them very differently, the researchers, led by Heintz and Ibañez-Tallon, conducted additional studies that further documented OxtrIN’s uneven influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2016 study, they found that the activation of OxtrINs reduce anxiety-related behavior in male mice but not in female mice. While it did not alter anxiety levels in female mice, it did, however, cause the females to show more social preference for male mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While both discoveries pointed to a critical role for the mPFC in adaptive social behaviors dependent on reproductive states, “how the mPFC senses internal hormonal states and regulates flexible control over social behavioral outputs remained unclear,” Li says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the current study, some of which was conducted at Tsinghua University, the researchers aimed to dive into those details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The circuit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The previous research had located oxytocin-sensitive neurons in multiple layers of the mPFC. For the current study, Li and colleagues homed in on layer 5, which sends information to other areas of the brain. They identified neurons in this layer that expressed the &lt;em&gt;Cacna1h&lt;/em&gt; gene, which produces calcium channels—electrical switches that neurons use to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then traced its connections into the anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHN) region of the hypothalamus, an ancient, hormonally driven part of the brain that regulates basic needs such as hunger, thirst, and sleep, as well as sexual behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then used a variety of advanced techniques to monitor neural activity in the female mice’s brains as they went through a full estrus cycle—the equivalent of a human menstrual cycle—and interacted with male mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cacna1h+ neurons turned out to be highly responsive to ovarian hormones, lighting up when the mice were fertile. During this period, the female mice sought out the male mice more, rejected them less, and showed heightened sexual receptivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting it all together, the team determined that Cacna1h+ neurons are a hormonally influenced critical subset of neurons that respond to prompts from oxytocin via OxtrINs, receiving social cues, and the AHN, which reads internal signals, resulting in sociosexual behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, manipulating the neurons changed that behavior in diametrically opposed ways in the mice. When Li turned on the &lt;em&gt;Cacna1h&lt;/em&gt; neurons in female mice during the nonfertile period, the mice began to act as if they were hormonally prepped to mate. And when she inhibited the neurons during estrus, the mice lost all interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opposite was true for the male mice, whose brain activity was also monitored. Silencing the Cacna1h+ neurons in male mice spiked their interest in female mice, and they were quicker to try to mate with them. And activating the neurons suppressed male sexual behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The circuit seems to have a feedback loop as well. That is, not only can Cacna1h+ neural activity initiate behavior, but behavior can activate the neurons themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In estrus females, these neurons were strongly activated by male cues and promoted sociosexual interest and sexual receptivity, while in males these neurons did not respond to female cues, and the male mice showed reduced interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s fascinating,” Ibañez-Tallon says. “Even when the neural circuitry, neuronal populations, and molecular components are identical—differing only in their levels of expression—the system can produce remarkably distinct functional outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study focused on ovarian hormones, in the future they’ll look into the influence of testosterone, which has well-established links to depression, schizophrenia, anxiety, and other disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the strikingly different functional roles of Cacna1h+ neurons in males, it’s likely that testosterone plays a key role in their development or responsiveness,” Li says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This line of research could provide valuable insights into the sex-specific regulation and vulnerability of social and emotional behaviors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6c070a0902162c1e030f07090a090000091e42090819" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Katherine Fenz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://rockefeller.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rockefeller University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Katherine Fenz – Rockefeller University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.04.035" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Integrating Reproductive States and Social Cues in the Control of Sociosexual Behaviors&lt;/a&gt;” by Nathaniel Heintz et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrating Reproductive States and Social Cues in the Control of Sociosexual Behaviors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Female sociosexual behaviors, essential for survival and reproduction, are modulated by ovarian hormones and triggered in the context of appropriate social cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we identify primary estrous-sensitive Cacna1h-expressing medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC&lt;sup&gt;Cacna1h+&lt;/sup&gt;) neurons that integrate hormonal states with recognition of potential mates to orchestrate these complex cognitive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bidirectional manipulation of mPFC&lt;sup&gt;Cacna1h+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons shifts opposite-sex-directed social behaviors between estrus and diestrus females via anterior hypothalamic outputs.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chromium is a trace element in foods like meat, grains, and produce. It may enhance the effects of insulin and help break down sugars, but more research is needed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One review concluded that chromium supplementation modestly improved hemoglobin A1c levels in people with type 2 diabetes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="story_dl"&gt;July 14 (UPI) --&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/public-health/covid-2665435130.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/COVID-19/" target="_blank" title="COVID-19" class="tpstyle"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; cases are on the rise again across the United States, with the biggest increases in parts of the South, Southeast and West Coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 25 states are seeing growth in COVID-19 cases as a summer wave appears to be starting, CBS News reported.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though activity remains "low" nationwide - based on CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html#national-region-trends" target="_blank"&gt;wastewater data&lt;/a&gt; - it's up from "very low" the week before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the biggest increases in emergency room visits for COVID-19 have happened in the Pacific Northwest and the Southeast. In those areas, rates are now the highest they've been since February and March, CBS News added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health experts had been watching for a possible summer spike, as new versions of the virus spread across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent CDC &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/25-0451_article" target="_blank"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; shows that COVID-19 now seems to follow a twice-a-year pattern: Cases usually peak once in the summer (July through September) and again in the winter (from December through February).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our analysis revealed biannual COVID-19 peaks in late summer and winter, a pattern that is expected to persist as long as the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and cyclical S1 diversity continues," CDC scientists wrote.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S1 diversity refers to ongoing changes in a key part of the virus's spike protein - specifically the S1 region, which helps the virus bind to human cells, CBS News reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC is also warning about another virus that's spreading more than usual right now: Parvovirus B19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people who catch this virus don't get very sick. But some develop &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/pulmonology/influenza-2665039558.html" target="_blank"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;-like symptoms, including fever, muscle aches and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pregnant women are at higher risk for complications from parvovirus B19. The CDC says they should take extra steps to protect themselves such as wearing a mask in high-risk places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chicago, health officials said emergency rooms are seeing a spike in patients with this virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Several of the most recent weeks saw the highest percentage of B19-associated ED visits compared to the same week in all years since 2015," health officials &lt;a href="https://www.chicagohan.org/alert-detail/-/alert-details/46690380?p_r_p_categoryId=undefined" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parvovirus B19 is not the same parvovirus that infects dogs and other canines.&lt;/p&gt;

Now he was unconscious, with a piece of bread lodged in his windpipe. Precious minutes went by as first responders were unable to help him with CPR or the Heimlich maneuver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd7f86" class="body-graf"&gt;In an ambulance on the way to the hospital, the elderly man’s skin was blue, and firefighters worried he was going to die. Palumbo — a fire department captain — used a scissors-like device called Magill forceps to pull the bread from the man’s throat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-63eeeb" class="body-graf"&gt;“We get a lot of calls in the city for choking,” many of which are resolved before emergency responders even get there, Palumbo added. “This was by far the worst one I’ve been on in my career.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-43fff1" class="body-graf"&gt;Fortunately, the man survived and made a full recovery, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f0739e" class="body-graf"&gt;But many elderly people do not. Each year, choking claims the lives of more than 4,100 Americans who are 65 or older. It’s the most vulnerable age group, accounting for about three-quarters of U.S. choking deaths, according to federal health statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-df5ab3" class="body-graf"&gt;The death rate has been relatively steady, but the number has risen, as the size of the nation’s retirement-age population grows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-25f858" class="body-graf"&gt;In response, a number of companies are marketing antichoking devices to the elderly. Medical professionals have been debating whether to endorse the products, sold under the names LifeVac, SaveLix, VitalVac and the Dechoker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d90396" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Nathan Charlton, a University of Virginia professor of emergency medicine who advises the American Red Cross on first aid, said there is limited evidence for the products and that the Red Cross is still evaluating them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-47ad75" class="body-graf"&gt;Here’s a look at choking and the best ways to prevent choking deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-649d55" class="body-heading"&gt;Choking is a danger to older adults&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-466e98" class="body-graf"&gt;Choking occurs when food or some other object partially or totally blocks the windpipe, preventing oxygen from reaching the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd91b3" class="body-graf"&gt;Telltale signs include someone reaching for their neck and losing the ability to speak normally. Brain damage can occur after four minutes, and death can come just a few minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f9949c" class="body-graf"&gt;Older adults are at higher risk for a number of reasons. As people get older, mouth and throat muscles can weaken. Older people also make less saliva. Some chronic diseases and medications can make swallowing even harder. Dentures can be a choking risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-83cf04" class="body-heading"&gt;The best ways to stop choking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-369267" class="body-graf"&gt;Choking risk can be reduced by cutting food into small pieces, chewing food slowly, drinking plenty of liquids with meals, and not laughing or talking at the same time you are chewing and swallowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3e1e6b" class="body-graf"&gt;When someone is choking, you can try perhaps the oldest form of first aid: back slaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0c8673" class="body-graf"&gt;There’s also the Heimlich maneuver, named after the doctor credited with devising it in the 1970s. It involves standing behind the choking person, wrapping your arms around their abdomen and — with a balled fist — thrusting inward and upward. The idea is that it forces air out of the lungs, and the obstruction with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-abc19d" class="body-graf"&gt;The American Red Cross recommends alternating back blows and abdominal thrusts in sets of five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d3f02a" class="body-graf"&gt;That’s for situations in which someone is around to help a choking victim. But what if they are alone?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6b9729" class="body-graf"&gt;It is possible for someone try to self-administer a Heimlich by thrusting their abdomen against the back of a chair, Charlton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1cb4e1" class="body-graf"&gt;Makers of some the newer anti-choking devices say that’s where their products can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-383a30" class="body-graf"&gt;“Elderly people probably are not capable of diving on a chair or counter,” said Arthur Lih, the founder and chief executive of LifeVac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-ce55cd" class="body-heading"&gt;Antichoking devices aren’t always risk-free&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a0873a" class="body-graf"&gt;They vary in design, but generally the devices look like a face mask attached to a tube or bellows, with a handle at the end. They typically sell for around $30 to $100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7e1b7d" class="body-graf"&gt;A choking person dons the mask, pushes down on the handle and then pulls up. That is supposed to create a suction that would pull out the blockage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-06d017" class="body-graf"&gt;Some research suggests at least certain devices can injure the tongue or cause bleeding and swelling in the throat. And the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has reports that some products did not generate enough suction and left people with bruising around the face, lips, and mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a4c733" class="body-graf"&gt;An injury report led the FDA to do an inspection and issue a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/dechoker-llc-614629-05102021"&gt;warning letter&lt;/a&gt; to Dechoker in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-073376" class="body-graf"&gt;Manufacturers note their products are registered with the FDA, but that’s not the same as an endorsement. Indeed, the agency last year issued a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/fda-encourages-public-follow-established-choking-rescue-protocols-fda-safety-communication"&gt;notice to consumers&lt;/a&gt; that said it has not approved antichoking devices sold over the counter, because their safety and effectiveness haven’t been established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c730f9" class="body-graf"&gt;Lih said the FDA action was in response to the proliferation of antichoking devices entering the market that vary in design and quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-b79c29" class="body-heading"&gt;More research is needed, choking expert says&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7d0001" class="body-graf"&gt;Right now, the consensus — even among antichoking device manufacturers — is that back blows and abdominal thrusts should always be tried first. (The forceps that Palumbo used are not recommended for the general public.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-41d241" class="body-graf"&gt;Lih said thousands of nursing homes and emergency response agencies have purchased the newer antichoking devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-47c615" class="body-graf"&gt;One example: The police department in Acworth, Georgia, bought about 75 LifeVac devices after an officer last year used her personal device to save an elderly woman. They are now in every patrol car, said Sgt. Eric Mistretta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-17b5a5" class="body-graf"&gt;Manufacturers claim the products have saved thousands of lives across multiple countries, but it’s tricky to document how well they actually work, said Dr. Cody Dunne, a University of Calgary researcher who has tried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9a6290" class="body-graf"&gt;The early evidence has come from case reports or small studies that used mannequins and cadavers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b70364" class="body-graf"&gt;“I think the case is definitely being built,” he said, but more rigorous research is needed. For example, a larger study could compare what happened during choking incidents at nursing homes that stock the devices with those that don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0e6c97" class="body-graf"&gt;Dunne noted, however, that evidence for the Heimlich maneuver and back slaps is evolving, too. He co-authored &lt;a href="https://www.resuscitationjournal.com/article/S0300-9572(24)00151-5/fulltext"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; last year that found back blows worked better than the Heimlich or chest compressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-35a18e" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“We’re only now getting good evidence on the old choking techniques, let alone these new ones,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 19:13:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxQX0RUWGlIWjljaUFZdHY5alhTN2F0T2dNZ1BMalRVV29HdDFDbHY0TXJqTjFNenp5M0Vmc09QRUk1YUlnXzE1STlFbks2V0hYSWZ6SnBQRjNUZnRxQzA0T3A0NUtoa2p0Mm5rWm1CZW4zVl9tdGNxMlJzdTRNMC1jSE10TVN3bmlJZTdjSUItdDYwZjJrU3dfdDFEa1BFNGVPbi1Cc1NxeFQweXF30gFWQVVfeXFMTjJ1S1FWekJFZVZ6ellKVVJhX3RmdzdPd0dyUkhMZ3pwR2VqLU5kNE1KcmVyd1Utcm5UQ1gzU0xVM0VNQmtrd3BXck5WSlF5WE42QUJzdkE</guid></item><item><title>需要睾酮增强吗？也许尝试一些Ozempic - Gizmodo | Need a Testosterone Boost?

              &lt;p&gt;Is there anything that Ozempic and drugs like it &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; do? A study out today finds that GLP-1 medications often raise men’s testosterone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists in St. Louis, Missouri, led the research, which studied men taking one of several GLP-1 drugs for their type 2 diabetes or obesity. On average, men’s testosterone rose significantly after they started taking a GLP-1, with many reaching normal levels. The findings suggest these weight loss drugs can also have reproductive health benefits for men, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Testosterone is important to both men’s and women’s health, but it’s especially vital to the former. In men, it helps maintain muscle mass, bone density, and fertility, to name a few functions. People who develop type 2 diabetes or obesity often experience declining T levels. Conversely, people who lose weight or get their blood sugar under control tend to &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/advance-article/doi/10.1210/clinem/dgaf137/8058933"&gt;regain&lt;/a&gt; this lost testosterone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the study authors, however, there isn’t much research looking into what happens to men and their testosterone once they start taking GLP-1s like semaglutide (the active ingredient in the diabetes drug Ozempic and the obesity drug Wegovy). And they wanted to better understand the broader health benefits of these medications beyond weight loss alone.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team analyzed over 200 men with type 2 diabetes or obesity who were prescribed a GLP-1 (semaglutide, tirzepatide, or the older GLP-1 dulaglutide) and who were not taking added testosterone or other hormones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The men’s blood sugar control and weight improved, as expected, with an average weight loss of 10%—and so did their testosterone. Men’s average total and free testosterone levels rose noticeably from their baseline. Only 53% of men had normal T levels before GLP-1 treatments; afterward, the same was true for 77% of men. The team’s findings were presented Monday at the Endocrine Society’s annual meeting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The T-boosting effects of GLP-1 therapy didn’t seem quite as large as those seen with other weight loss treatments, particularly surgery. These drugs offer their own advantages, though, according to lead study researcher Shellsea Portillo Canales.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“It’s less dramatic than the rise seen after bariatric surgery, which typically causes rapid and substantial hormonal shifts,” Portillo Canales, an endocrinology fellow at SSM Health St. Louis University Hospital, told Gizmodo. “However, the benefit of GLP-1s is that they are non-invasive, more accessible, and can help improve testosterone naturally, especially when combined with sustained weight loss.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The improvement in men’s testosterone levels correlated well with how many pounds they shed, suggesting that weight loss is the primary driver of this effect. But Portillo Canales doesn’t rule out that other factors, like improved insulin resistance and lower inflammation, could matter, too.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers would like to further confirm this link through prospective studies that proactively track men and their testosterone levels once on GLP-1 therapy. But given that these patients are already taking these drugs for their diabetes or obesity, the potential boost in testosterone could be seen as a nifty bonus at the very least. Just be careful, though. Portillo Canales notes that if men stop taking a GLP-1 and start to gain back weight, their testosterone levels might sink back down along with it.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

A new study found that erythritol exposure reduced nitric oxide, increased vessel constrictors, impaired clot-busting abilities, and boosted free radical production in these cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes create a higher risk environment for clotting and reduced blood flow to the brain.

It has almost no calories, is about 80% as sweet as table sugar, and has negligible impact on insulin levels, making it a favorite for people trying to lose weight, keep their blood sugar in check or avoid carbohydrates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But recent research has begun to shed light on its risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One recent study involving 4,000 people in the U.S. and Europe found that men and women with higher circulating levels of erythritol were significantly more likely to have a heart attack or stroke within the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeSouza and first author Auburn Berry, a graduate student in his lab, set out to understand what might be driving that increased risk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers in the lab treated human cells that line blood vessels in the brain for three hours with about the same amount of erythritol contained in a typical sugar-free beverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They observed that the treated cells were altered in numerous ways: They expressed significantly less nitric oxide, a molecule that relaxes and widens blood vessels, and more endothelin-1, a protein that constricts blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, when challenged with a clot-forming compound called thrombin, cellular production of the natural clot-busting compound t-PA was “markedly blunted.” The erythritol-treated cells also produced more reactive oxygen species (ROS), a.k.a. “free radicals,” metabolic byproducts which can age and damage cells and inflame tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Big picture, if your vessels are more constricted and your ability to break down blood clots is lowered, your risk of stroke goes up,” said Berry. “Our research demonstrates not only that, but how erythritol has the potential to increase stroke risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeSouza notes that their study used only a serving-size worth of the sugar substitute.  For those who consume multiple servings per day, the impact, presumably, could be worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors caution that their study was a laboratory study, conducted on cells, and larger studies in people are needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, De Souza encourages consumers to read labels, looking for erythritol or “sugar alcohol” on the label. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the epidemiological study that inspired our work, and now our cellular findings, we believe it would be prudent for people to monitor their consumption of non-nutrient-sweeteners such as this one,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and neurology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bdd1d4cedc93d0dccfced5dcd1d1fdded2d1d2cfdcd9d293d8d9c8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lisa Marshall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://colorado.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Colorado&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Lisa Marshall – University of Colorado&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The non-nutritive sweetener erythritol adversely affects brain microvascular endothelial cell function&lt;/a&gt;” by Auburn Berry et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The non-nutritive sweetener erythritol adversely affects brain microvascular endothelial cell function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experimental aim of this study was to determine, in vitro, the effect of the non-nutritive sweetener erythritol on brain microvascular endothelial cell oxidative stress, nitric oxide (NO) and endothelin (ET)-1 production, as well as tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMECs) were cultured and treated with 6 mM erythritol, equivalent to a typical amount of erythritol (30 g) in an artificially sweetened beverage, for 3 h.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was significantly higher in hCMECs treated with erythritol (204 ± 32% vs. 105 ± 4%) as well as the expression of antioxidant proteins, superoxide dismutase-1 [332.1 ± 16.2 vs. 214.9 ± 4.7 arbitrary units (AU); &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002] and catalase (30.9 ± 0.3 vs. 24.4 ± 0.9 AU; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression was not significantly altered (102.8 ± 21.4 vs. 99.0 ± 19.9 AU); the expression of p-eNOS (Ser1177) was lower (52.1 ± 2.1 vs. 77.3 ± 9.1 AU; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and p-eNOS (Thr495) was higher (63.4 ± 8.0 vs. 45.6 ± 6.9 AU; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.006) in hCMECs treated with erythritol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cell expression of Big ET-1 was also higher in erythritol-treated cells (56.4 ± 9.8 vs. 40.9 ± 6.5 AU; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.02). Consequently, the endothelial NO production was significantly lower (5.8 ± 0.8 vs. 7.3 ± 0.7 µmol/L) and ET-1 production was significantly higher (34.6 ± 2.3 vs. 26.9 ± 1.5 pg/mL) in response to erythritol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;t-PA release in response to thrombin was significantly blunted in erythritol-treated (from 87.4 ± 6.3 to 87.6 ± 8.3 pg/mL) versus untreated (90.1 ± 5.5 to 110.2 ± 6.4 pg/mL) hCMECs. In summary, erythritol adversely affects oxidative stress, NO production, ET-1 production, and t-PA release in brain microvascular endothelial cells, potentially contributing to the increased risk of ischemic stroke associated with erythritol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW &amp;amp; NOTEWORTHY&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol, a common non-nutritive sweetener, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study provides novel data, demonstrating that erythritol (at a concentration typically contained in a standard-size commercially available artificially sweetened beverage) adversely affects brain microvascular endothelial cell oxidative stress, eNOS activation and NO production, ET-1 expression, and t-PA release in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 18:59:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE1sOWlqRmJGYURQcElpNDB3YVZXV0tjbl94VjJHMVJiZGFPT0xjU1NkSWlLaFp6M082MWhFQW1NLXN1VEg4U3JLWFIzQk0wZmVkUGdjdGJ1RU1aTlZsRFVEM1RnQzkzb295SmMwSTRQR2U</guid></item><item><title>研究证实，超加工食品与严重健康问题之间存在直接联系- Earth.com | Study confirms direct link between ultra-processed foods and serious health problems - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQMEtoTERzb3NfaWFsb1YyY194VzBWZGhuWElYdnpFdDhYTENCZFM1ZW5ZVkZYVEljXy0wQWo5MGx6bVppUUM4a1VDcHRzSGs1NFlhR0QxcXhvZjNDQUdfOWNoR2xiNUJ3Q2lYSkl4aVlhM2ROLU9pNmhiYlZ5cy0yTjllZ0NoS29YYy05YjBWQk8zcFVLamJETUZmUV82cG4tMGtCZXY4R1JySGc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neon‑hued breakfast cereals, microwave‑ready pizzas, and oversized bags of chips now crowd supermarket aisles. A new study draws a sharp line between that convenience found in ultra-processed foods and a cluster of early warning signs for chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It may be about the additives, the packaging, even the marketing,” said &lt;a href="https://mira.mcmaster.ca/our-faculty/anthea-christoforou/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Anthea Christoforou&lt;/a&gt; of McMaster University, who led the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-ultra-processed-foods"&gt;Understanding ultra-processed foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/breaking-free-from-ultra-processed-foods-the-surprising-health-benefits/"&gt;industrial concoctions&lt;/a&gt; designed for convenience, shelf life, and hyper-palatability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of packaged snacks, sugary cereals, soda, instant noodles, and frozen meals – these aren’t just “processed,” they’re engineered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers strip raw ingredients of their natural nutrients, then add fats, sugars, artificial flavors, emulsifiers, preservatives, and colorings to craft something addictive and uniform. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is food that barely resembles its original form and is often high in calories but low in real nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trouble is, UPFs are everywhere – and they’re linked to a rising tide of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ultra-processed-foods-make-our-bodies-age-faster/"&gt;chronic health issues&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ultra-processed-foods-raise-alarms"&gt;Ultra‑processed foods raise alarms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health agencies classify foods by how much industry tampering they undergo, a system formalized in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38418082/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NOVA classification&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Canadian sample, daily intake averaged just over three servings of these items, but the top quarter of participants swallowed nearly six, crowding out fruit and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A landmark metabolic‑ward trial showed that volunteers offered ultra‑processed food menus ate about 500 extra calories per day compared with identical nutrient profiles made from &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-tool-lets-you-check-how-processed-your-food-is-grocerydb/"&gt;unprocessed foods&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in that study gained nearly two pounds in just two weeks, underscoring the silent calorie creep of factory‑formulated meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inflammation-is-the-hidden-spark"&gt;Inflammation is the hidden spark&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the strongest signals in the McMaster dataset was a rise in &lt;a href="https://www.uscjournal.com/articles/high-sensitivity-c-reactive-protein-atherosclerotic-cardiovascular-disease-measure-or-not?language_content_entity=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;C‑reactive protein&lt;/a&gt;, a liver‑made marker that flags systemic inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High levels of this protein are now listed as a heart‑disease risk enhancer, so its appearance in heavy snackers hints at trouble brewing beneath the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These foods are causing an inflammatory response, in a sense our bodies see them as some kind of other element,” Christoforou explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beyond-the-bathroom-scale"&gt;Beyond the bathroom scale&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skeptics sometimes argue that the harms of packaged foods stem solely from the extra pounds they add, yet the study adjusted for body mass index and still saw higher insulin and triglycerides in high‑UPF eaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prospective U.S. cohorts reached a similar conclusion, linking high UPF diets to a 24 percent jump in type 2 diabetes risk even after accounting for weight changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/about-niddk/staff-directory/biography/hall-kevin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kevin Hall&lt;/a&gt;’s metabolic‑ward &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31105044/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;experiment&lt;/a&gt; supports that idea, showing that people chewed faster, finished meals sooner, and felt less full when the dishes were ultra‑processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-socioeconomic-angles-and-policy-gaps"&gt;Socioeconomic angles and policy gaps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the McMaster survey, heavy UPF eaters were more likely to have lower incomes and less formal education. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The health risks persist independently of income and education, highlighting the need for broad, equitable food policies,” warned Angelina Baric, a graduate student co‑author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38719536/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; covering 45 million person‑years estimated that cutting UPF intake could avert thousands of premature deaths annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-marketing-that-targets-children"&gt;Marketing that targets children&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods aren’t just convenient, they’re &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ultraprocessed-foods-pose-major-health-risks-especially-for-kids/"&gt;aggressively marketed&lt;/a&gt;. From children’s cartoons on cereal boxes to bold health claims on energy bars, these strategies are designed to shape preferences early and build loyalty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2653912" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that marketing exposure significantly influences eating habits, especially among youth and low-income populations who may have fewer healthy options available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these products carry front-of-package labels that promote added fiber, vitamins, or protein, giving a false impression of health. These claims often distract from the overall quality of the food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6364956/"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that nutrient-focused labels can mislead consumers into thinking a product is healthier than it actually is, even when it’s high in added sugar or sodium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-food-matrix-and-biological-effects"&gt;Food matrix and biological effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the more &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-ultra-processed-foods-makes-your-muscles-weaker-and-more-fragile/"&gt;overlooked aspects&lt;/a&gt; of ultra-processed foods is how they alter the food matrix, the physical and chemical structure of what we eat, which affects how it’s digested and absorbed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By breaking down fiber, emulsifying fats, and adding sugars, UPFs speed up digestion, increase glycemic load, and can bypass natural satiety signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s growing concern that these structural changes may harm the gut microbiome, the community of microbes that helps regulate immunity and metabolism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests certain emulsifiers and artificial sweeteners commonly used in UPFs can disrupt gut bacteria and may lead to inflammatory responses, insulin resistance, and other metabolic issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-of-ultra-processed-foods"&gt;Future of ultra‑processed foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dialing back UPF does not require an all‑or‑nothing pledge; replacing even one daily serving with whole fruit or unsalted nuts trimmed inflammatory markers in trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietitians recommend starting with breakfast, swapping sugared cereal for oatmeal, then moving on to snacks, habits that nudge down average servings without demanding perfection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/food-nutrition/food-safety/food-additives.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Health Canada&lt;/a&gt; is already reviewing additives and marketing rules, and the new biomarker evidence gives those deliberations fresh urgency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://nutritionandmetabolism.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12986-025-00935-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrition &amp;amp; Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 18:05:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQMEtoTERzb3NfaWFsb1YyY194VzBWZGhuWElYdnpFdDhYTENCZFM1ZW5ZVkZYVEljXy0wQWo5MGx6bVppUUM4a1VDcHRzSGs1NFlhR0QxcXhvZjNDQUdfOWNoR2xiNUJ3Q2lYSkl4aVlhM2ROLU9pNmhiYlZ5cy0yTjllZ0NoS29YYy05YjBWQk8zcFVLamJETUZmUV82cG4tMGtCZXY4R1JySGc</guid></item><item><title>“我感觉很虚弱” ： NC女性在32岁时诊断出子宫内膜癌后敦促提高认识- WRAL.com | 'I felt so weak': NC woman urges awareness after endometrial cancer diagnosis at 32 - WRAL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxNWElmS3ZNMU5wRUVaemZWSW8zZDRDZ0pPNWVtWG5hQlhlVXRDMURQN0NWaWFnNlFwMkg2WmxsaDQtU2F3cXRyMHNvT2ZoWTB3QzYzRWFOcEN6azNVYXRDODlJa1E1a0ItN05fdEk0eGtjOEZYZ0RkbGpXYkRwMWlGTFNfRFhRWHZESlpkVHRkTTV6OVRZcDdBNTZpNEZqUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;
					
						&lt;p&gt;At 32, Wendy Maultsby was working full-time and planning out
her dream future: meeting her future husband, getting married, and giving birth
to her first child.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;But what awaited Maultsby was a diagnosis she never anticipated—and
certainly not in her 30s. If she ever imagined it, she thought it would come
when she was a grandmother in her 70s. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Around February 2022, I started what I thought was a
regular menstrual cycle,” the now 35-year-old recalled. “Everything seemed
normal, but things seemed strange when it started getting heavier than usual.
It lasted for about two-and-a-half months.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Maultsby shared her symptoms were relentless and resulted in
multiple trips to urgent care. She was given medication that would offer temporary
relief, but the bleeding continued. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“It got to the point where one day I just felt so weak. I
was in my office at work and I was so weak I couldn’t even walk to my car,” she
said. “I knew something was wrong. My heart was beating incredibly fast. I got
home, I went straight to bed, and I thought, ‘I’ll just sleep it off. Maybe I’m
just tired or stressed.’”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;When she didn’t feel better the next morning, Maultsby said
her gut told her she needed to go to the emergency room. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“I got to the ER, and they put me back into the room almost
immediately. It turned out I had lost so much blood that I required a blood
transfusion,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Her extreme blood loss was putting additional stress on her
heart and causing it to pump harder than usual to circulate what little blood
she had left. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;An emergency gynecological visit to Johnston Memorial
Hospital in Smithfield caused the Johnston County resident to be scheduled for
a biopsy. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Maultsby told WRAL, “The doctor was like, ‘It’s super highly
unlikely this is it, but I just want to cross all of my Ts.’ I almost canceled that
appointment because the schedule of birth control that she had given me did
stop the bleeding. I was like ‘Oh, I’m fine. I’m cured.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Maultsby still remembers the Friday morning, just a few days
after her biopsy, when she got the call that changed her life.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“He said, ‘I’m so sorry, but you do have cancer.’ I was in
complete shock,” she said. “The first thing I thought about was, ‘Am I going to

						&lt;p&gt;She was diagnosed with grade 1 endometrial cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The average age of diagnosis for endometrial cancer is 60,
according to the American Cancer Society, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/endometrial-cancer/about/key-statistics.html"&gt;with diagnoses under 45 being uncommon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Maultsby said she was told her prognosis was good and she
would likely live a long life because the cancer was caught early. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;But her dream of getting pregnant was suddenly in jeopardy. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“My biggest fear was that my fertility would be affected,”
she said. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Maultsby continued, “My options were basically to have a hysterectomy,
or have hormone treatment. I opted to do hormone treatment so that I would have
the possibility of motherhood.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Three years later, Maultsby is celebrating five months of
marriage. She shared she and her husband are continuing to weigh all their
options of becoming parents. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We’re still going to try to become parents the natural way,
but if that doesn’t work out then we plan to adopt,” said Maultsby. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Dr. Angeles Alvarez Secord with the Duke Cancer Center is one
of the physicians who has been treating Maultsby. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The gynecologic oncologist shared cases like Maultsby’s are
becoming more common as the cancer affects a greater number of young adults. &lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;WRAL investigated the rise in younger cancer cases in our
recent documentary &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/story/diagnosis-young-the-new-face-of-cancer-in-nc/22052931/"&gt;Diagnosis:
Young, The New Face of Cancer in NC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“This disease
continues to rise in the United States,” shared Alvarez
Secord. “It's anticipated that about 70,000 women will have a diagnosis of
uterine cancer this year, and almost 14,000 women will die.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The physician stated education is vital to reducing the grim
statistic, particularly among at-risk demographics. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Individuals who identify as Black are at a twofold
increased risk of death,” she added. “We’re seeing an aggressive rise in
cancers in women under the age of 50. These issues in totality, they cannot be
ignored.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Alvarez Secord said abnormal bleeding is the most common symptom
patients will present with, regardless of age. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“If somebody is postmenopausal and they’ve stopped having
their periods and have any bleeding at all, even just a red dab, that is a huge
warning sign,” the doctor advised. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;She continued, “If it’s before menopause, it can be
harder. What you’re looking for is, is there an increase in that bleeding
pattern or are they having bleeding between their periods, or any sort of abnormal
bleeding.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;She noted that bleeding after sexual intercourse is
another sign someone should seek medical attention. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Alvarez Secord said in addition to a biopsy, a patient may
have a pelvic ultrasound to help reach a diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The physician noted clinicians also need to be more aware
of the growing impact cancer is having on younger demographics to prevent
symptoms from being misdiagnosed or missed entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Often they will think it’s their period, and it’s not
just them that think that, it could be their healthcare providers as well,”
said Alvarez Secord. “For the care providers that are on the front lines, it’s having
that little ‘red flag’ in the back of your head that somebody complains their
cycles are increasing, or becoming abnormal, or bleeding between periods or
after sex—that needs to trigger some sort of evaluation.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Maultsby added more open conversations among those with
diagnoses like herself could help reduce stigma, and aid in earlier
intervention. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“It was almost embarrassing to talk about at first,”
Maultsby added. “I wanted nobody to know because I felt like I had an elderly
person’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Maultsby told WRAL she often questioned, “What did I do
wrong?” after being diagnosed at such a young age. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Knowing it is an epidemic, makes me want to share my story
because I know a lot more people are going to be diagnosed in the coming years,”
she said. “They need to know they’re not alone, and it’s not your fault. This
is something that is ongoing and it is happening. Research has come so far, but
we need more of it, and we just need to advocate for each other and ourselves
in this fight against cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Alvarez Secord further underscored the call for more
research, adding, “We need to do something. It's a serious call for action.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The oncologist noted recent NIH cuts impacting medical
research nationwide, &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/news/local/unc-chapel-hill-126m-federal-grant-cuts-june-2025/"&gt;including
cancer research in the Triangle&lt;/a&gt;, is cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“It is very hard for OBGYNs to
compete at that level,” Alvarez Secord said. “I think probably in terms of NH
dollars, OBGYNs represent about 1% of that. When you cut funding even further,
I'm worried that we're going to lose a generation of researchers who are going
to have a calling to do this work specifically for cancers that affect women.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;When asked what she thought might contribute to the rise in
young cancer diagnoses, Alvarez Secord called attention to the food supply.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“I think there's a lot of
potential linkages between food, not just highly processed, but different types
of food that we eat. We've gone from an environment where you used to eat food that
came out of your own garden, to an environment where now everything's bought at
the grocery store. And, a lot of people don't even eat raw vegetables and
fruits,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Maultsby said one of her biggest
pieces of advice for other young adults is to prioritize their health. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“People need to empower themselves,
especially with learning their own family history and their own personal risk,”
she said. “Remember your health is so precious. Being so young, it is easy to
take health for granted.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;She continued, “When I was younger,
I wish I had limited alcohol more. I wish I had been more physically active, and
consumed less processed foods, and slept better. I definitely didn’t take as
great care of myself as I do today. It’s only because once you lose your health
it becomes the most precious thing to you.”&lt;/p&gt;

It can increase your heart rate and blood pressure so much that it causes your heart to fail, and that’s why it’s such a big problem,” said O’Shea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study found that most exposures among children resulted in minor or no effects, but there were 39 cases with major medical outcomes, which include seizures and respiratory failure, and two deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Health providers say adults should store the product in a locked area of the home or cabinet so children cannot access them, and to avoid using the products in front of children, who are likely to mimic such behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Kids are incredibly curious.

                                &lt;p&gt;SULLIVAN, N.Y. -- Mosquitoes collected from a trap in the Town of Sullivan have tested positive for the Jamestown Canyon virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's according to Madison County Public Health, which received notification from the New York State Department of Health Wadsworth Laboratory regarding the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No human cases of JCV have been reported in the County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JCV can be transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the health department, "JCV does not spread from person to person."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many people infected with JCV do not have symptoms. For people who get sick, symptoms may occur in a few days to 2 weeks. Symptoms may start with a fever, fatigue, and headache. Respiratory symptoms may develop and include a sore throat, runny nose and cough. In rare cases, JCV may cause inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) or spinal cord (meningitis). Symptoms of encephalitis or meningitis include stiff neck, confusion, loss of coordination, difficulty speaking or seizures. Some people who develop severe disease may need to be hospitalized. Most recover from the virus," according to the local health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The detection of this virus in Madison County serves as a reminder of the presence of mosquito-borne diseases in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.madisoncounty.ny.gov/2985/Mosquitos-and-Disease" target="_blank"&gt;Click here for more information about mosquitoes from Madison County Public Health.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The LE8 includes eight specific health behaviors and factors to help determine a person’s heart health:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be more active&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Control cholesterol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat better&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get healthy sleep&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manage blood pressure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manage blood sugar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manage weight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quit tobacco&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The eight components identified by the American Heart Association as being linked to cardiovascular disease risk are already well established,” El Khoudary explained. “What remains unclear, however, is how well women in midlife are doing in relation to these components.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6784846/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:previous work;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;previous work&lt;/a&gt; has revealed that the menopause transition is really a critical turning point, a time when women experience changes in many components of Life’s Essential 8,” she continued. “So, women really need to work to counteract all of those changes in midlife to protect their cardiovascular health in the ensuing years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Only 1 in 5 menopausal women have ideal heart health scores&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the study, El Khoudary and her team found that four LE8 components — managing blood sugar and blood pressure, sleep quality, and nicotine use — were the main factors driving study participants’ future heart disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This finding is important because it highlights key areas … that may have the greatest impact on future heart health for women,” El Khoudary explained. “However, our study did not test whether targeting these specifically leads to better outcomes than focusing on other factors. This is an important question for future clinical trials to explore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also discovered that only one in five menopausal women have an ideal LE8 score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we compare this to the general population, the prevalence is very close,” El Khoudary said. “There’s very low prevalence of optimal LE8 scores. Unfortunately, many people still need to do more, including women who are in this vulnerable stage, the menopause transition. Of course, that’s easier said than done! There are many barriers to living up to Life’s Essential 8. And there is also a lack of awareness. We need to continue to work to address both of those challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Next, we need to understand why many midlife women struggle to maintain ideal heart health and what barriers they face. Research should focus on testing interventions targeting glucose, blood pressure, nicotine use, and sleep to reduce long-term risk. Improving sleep quality also deserves more attention. Ultimately, finding effective ways to help women adopt and stick to healthy habits is key.”&lt;br&gt;— Samar R.

Some studies show that taking vitamin D supplements daily may help lower blood pressure, too.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-does-the-research-say"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Does the Research Say? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The research on how vitamin D supplements impact blood pressure is mixed. Some research has found that people with low &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/normal-vitamin-d-levels-by-age-8771592" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;levels of vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; tend to have &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/hypertension-treatment-1763942" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;higher blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But when researchers look at what happens when people take &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/is-vitamin-d-useful-6386319" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D supplements regularly&lt;/a&gt;, the results are mixed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Some studies show a small benefit, while others show no change at all.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What seems most promising is that vitamin D might help lower blood pressure if you already have &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/high-blood-pressure-facts-5649309" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/vitamin-d-deficiency-2224209" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;low vitamin D levels&lt;/a&gt; to begin with. In these cases, the supplement may offer a small boost in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/living-well-with-hypertension-1764117" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;managing blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But even then, the blood pressure-lowering effect isn’t guaranteed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Older adults who are both low in vitamin D and have high blood pressure may benefit the most. For them, taking vitamin D may help improve blood pressure as part of an overall plan that includes a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/diet-or-exercise-for-blood-pressure-7563429" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy diet, exercise&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly medication.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no one-size-fits-all answer to how much vitamin D you should take to lower blood pressure. In research studies, the dose of vitamin D has ranged from 800 to 4,000 IU (international units) per day. Interestingly, higher doses don’t always lead to better results for blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Infants (0–12 months): 400 IU per day&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children and adults (1–70 years): 600 IU per day&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adults over 70: 800 IU per day&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some people may need more, especially if they’re at higher risk of &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/vitamin-deficiency-3014720" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D deficiency&lt;/a&gt;. This includes people with limited sun exposure, darker skin, certain health conditions, or older age. Many experts recommend around 1,000–2,000 IU per day for these groups.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most people can safely take vitamin D every day at the recommended amounts.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Older adults who eat eggs more than once a week may be less likely to develop Alzheimer's disease, a new study claims&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Alzheimer's Association &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-5527593/5-7-million-people-Alzheimers-costing-277-BILLION-year.html"&gt;warns that nearly 13 million Americans may be affected by 2050.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there is no clear cause of the disease, experts believe that cases of Alzheimer's are set to increase in the future due to genetic mutations and lifestyle choices, such as physical inactivity, unhealthy diet and social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To find the link between consuming eggs and the potential decrease in the risk of developing Alzheimer's, the researchers analyzed data from 1,024 dementia-free people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants were asked to fill in a well-known food frequency questionnaire developed at Harvard University that captures their typical diet over the previous year, including how often they ate eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once completed, they were followed by the researchers for nearly seven years and underwent yearly assessments for signs of Alzheimer's dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists divided these participants into four groups based on how often they consumed eggs: less than once per month, one to three times per month, once per week and two or more times per week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The volunteer's answers as well as the data from their cognitive tests were then evaluated using various statistical models. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with the 1,024 living participants, another 578 participants donated their brains for research after death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Those who ate eggs once-a-week or two-or-more-times-per-week groups had about half the risk of developing Alzheimer's dementia compared to those who consumed eggs less than once a month&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;These brain samples allowed the scientists to assess whether egg intake was related to the presence of dementia-related markers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It remains unclear if all the deceased participants were suffering from dementia prior to their death. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed that people who ate eggs at least once a week had a lower rate of clinical Alzheimer's diagnosis than those who ate them rarely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specifically, those who ate eggs once-a-week or two-or-more-times-per-week groups had about half the risk of developing Alzheimer's dementia compared to those who consumed eggs less than once a month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants who ate eggs more frequently also had significantly higher average choline levels over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While this observational study did not expand on how choline can decrease the risk of Alzheimer's disease by up to 40 percent, the scientists theorized that it's overall protective effect may play a critical role in protecting brain cells from damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Choline is a nutrient essential for producing acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that maintains the brain's memory and learning capacity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also plays a significant role in maintaining and protecting the structure of cell membranes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous studies have shown that low choline levels in the blood are associated with increased levels of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain - both of which are the main culprits in the development of the Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Alzheimer's Association warns that by 2050, nearly 13 million Americans may be affected&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The plaques and tangles form when amyloid proteins misfold and stick together, forming sticky clumps (plaques) and when tau proteins twist and get tied up (tangles). These toxic buildups block brain cells, or neurons, from sending signals properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, this can impair brain functioning and lead to memory and muscle decline. If it persists, this disruption can cause permanent damage in the brain that leads to Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As the disease progresses, patients may lose the ability to speak, care for themselves or even respond to the world around them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers believe that regularly consuming eggs can maintain choline levels in the body, which in turn can help maintain brain cell health and prevent the formation of amyloid plaques and tau tangles.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even though the liver produces choline in small amounts, experts say that it is necessary to consume food items such as egg yolks, fish, soybeans and legumes to maintain the required levels of the nutrient in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the National Institute of Health, adult women (above the age of 19) need to consume about 425 milligrams of choline per day while adult men need to consume 550 mg of the nutrient every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One large hard boiled egg has about 147 mg of choline while half a cup of roasted soybeans contain about 107 mg of the nutrient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the other hand, three ounces of pan-fried beef liver contains about 356 mg of choline while three ounces of cooked fresh cod merely has 71 mg of the nutrient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 16:48:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxQekVIUGVyS2V5anlNRGtqWkhPRno3WF9fNzhFNUlVMkdIQXFUNjZQbzlJWHRJWkFZaHhQUm1ydTV5cndvejNPQzVRX2tGdXAxcmNaSGpUclhiM1VHeHRjWDdqYmhYb3B4cWx6UFhoRlhuVm9sYXV4Z0loUk8tWnE4aEt2aGFVV0gtSHlSMGdjREdNSHJxX1N3cFBB</guid></item><item><title>如果你在40岁之后仍然在做这5个力量动作，那么你做错了-吃这个不是那个 | If You’re Still Doing These 5 Strength Moves After 40, You’re Doing It Wrong - Eat This Not That</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTFBXb2NzSWhuNUhZdHBTRFQ1cS0wQ3FBVmVKNnlwcDlwdk4tOTZnWFotVm1pTXlxSllsNjJ6dWZWZnZHNXpCMkcyeGlwbDRuRW1FT2V5TngydXhaTURKSnBWblB0cWlGc3VrVTlkbzdyOTI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content single-post-content"&gt;
										
					
					
					
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/strength-training-mistakes-to-avoid/" target="_blank"&gt;Strength training&lt;/a&gt; is essential—especially as you age and the natural loss of muscle mass ensues. As long as you work out regularly, you will &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/functional-training-exercises-to-build-strength/" target="_blank"&gt;build strength&lt;/a&gt; and be on a good track, right? Wrong! There are many popular strength habits that may be destroying your gains, and you don’t even know it. To learn what these common “bad habits” are when it comes to your workout, we spoke with &lt;b&gt;Luke Jones&lt;/b&gt;, a certified personal trainer at &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.heromovement.net/" target="_blank"&gt;HERO Movement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke tells us, “It’s worth noting that not every phase of training has to be about progressing. You might train for enjoyment, maintenance, or stress relief—all totally valid. But if building strength is the goal, small tweaks in load, reps, tempo, or complexity help stimulate the adaptation and growth you’re after.”&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;One point that’s noteworthy is that not every phase of working out needs to progress. It’s perfectly fine to train for maintenance, to relieve stress, and for your enjoyment. But if strength building is your mission, it’s crucial to be mindful of your reps, speed, load, and the difficulty of your workout in order to help kick up the muscle build you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, let’s delve into the common strength training habits you may be doing with good intentions, but may actually stall your progress over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our bodies respond best when the stimulus shifts slightly now and then—whether that’s more load, slower tempo, shorter rest period or just a different rep range,” Luke says. “It doesn’t mean we have to be improving every single session—it’s more about the long-term trend.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a movement isn’t performed with good form, why bother?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Getting stronger usually means lifting heavier at some point, but ideally not at the expense of movement quality,” Luke points out. “There’s a time and place for chasing PBs, and it can be fun to test yourself now and then. But going all out all the time takes its toll, so I’d much rather see people prioritizing technique, recovery, and incremental progress.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luke explains, “Big lifts are great—they’re fun, rewarding, and often get center stage. But they’re not the full story. Mobility work, shoulder stabilization, and accessory movements can make a real difference to how we move, how we feel, and how long we can keep doing it all. You don’t need to go overboard—just enough to keep things ticking over.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything you jump into without thinking about is a total time-waster—and that includes your workout plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Training without any structure—whether it’s progression, variety, or planned recovery—can work for some, but for others leads to overwhelm and a loss of motivation,” Luke tells us. “A bit of forethought, whether that’s following a program, working with a coach, or even just choosing when to push and when to back off, can make a big difference. It doesn’t need to be complicated to be effective!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proper recovery time after a workout is just as important as the workout itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pushing hard every session is often touted as the best way to train, but the reality is that going all out all the time isn’t sustainable,” says Luke. “It’s in the rest between sessions—sleeping, recovering, taking care of ourselves—where the real rebuilding happens. A little attention to the basics, like nutrition and managing stress, can go a long way in helping you get more from the work in the gym.”&lt;/p&gt;

The LE8 includes eight specific health behaviors and factors to help determine a person’s heart health:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be more active&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Control cholesterol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eat better&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get healthy sleep&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage blood sugar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage weight&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quit tobacco&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The eight components identified by the American Heart Association as being linked to cardiovascular disease risk are already well established,” El Khoudary explained. “What remains unclear, however, is how well women in midlife are doing in relation to these components.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6784846/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;previous work&lt;/a&gt; has revealed that the menopause transition is really a critical turning point, a time when women experience changes in many components of Life’s Essential 8,” she continued. “So, women really need to work to counteract all of those changes in midlife to protect their cardiovascular health in the ensuing years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the study, El Khoudary and her team found that four LE8 components — managing blood sugar and blood pressure, sleep quality, and nicotine use — were the main factors driving study participants’ future heart disease risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This finding is important because it highlights key areas … that may have the greatest impact on future heart health for women,” El Khoudary explained. “However, our study did not test whether targeting these specifically leads to better outcomes than focusing on other factors. This is an important question for future clinical trials to explore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also discovered that only one in five menopausal women have an ideal LE8 score. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we compare this to the general population, the prevalence is very close,” El Khoudary said. “There’s very low prevalence of optimal LE8 scores. Unfortunately, many people still need to do more, including women who are in this vulnerable stage, the menopause transition. Of course, that’s easier said than done! There are many barriers to living up to Life’s Essential 8. And there is also a lack of awareness.

The Northeast was the hardest-hit region, according to the CDC.

The CDC received more than 89,000 reports of Lyme disease in 2023,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;but on its website, it also says “estimates using other methods suggest that approximately 476,000 people may be diagnosed and treated for Lyme disease each year in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EXAQFZ7LOVFR3KZ2O34OIPEOGE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This year, as of July 8,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the D.C.

The Virginia Department of Health has reported 297 “confirmed or probable” tick-borne illnesses, of which 248 are Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NF6E6NGAVVHJFKGNWFPPRVVK5Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Ticks are also responsible for babesiosis, a malaria-like disease characterized by fever-like symptoms, and alpha-gal syndrome, a disease that causes an allergy to red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="CTENPRY35RF7BE3KXD5KZMQZJQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="CTENPRY35RF7BE3KXD5KZMQZJQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Why you might be seeing more ticks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7EULQKZGRFDFVHK6YVX7GA6BKQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One reason behind the increase in ticks is climate change. The area’s longer warm periods and milder winters create conditions that make it easier for ticks to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MHGJLIZAC5DSRHJMHWSXU7T6QM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Climate change is also responsible for the influx of the lone star tick, which was previously found only in the southern United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BK32N5DJ6BFAXMUT42C7PBAU4M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Another factor is the population of animals, like deer and white-footed mice, that ticks latch onto. A lack of large predators and hunting restrictions, combined with an abundance in food, allow these animal populations to thrive. Years where oak trees produce a large amount of acorns are called mast years. The year after mast years is when tick populations can thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PQKPLKIDIBE7DBLFTH4CP23VEY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Then we would expect to see greater transmission, because we now have higher populations of infected mice, infected ticks, and a greater ability to transmit, a greater probability that the tick will carry the Lyme disease and give it to a human,” Raupp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="G554JH2QYFHSXD6B234SIXAILE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="G554JH2QYFHSXD6B234SIXAILE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What to do when you find a tick&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NPJCYQLXA5A3BMNO6SLAJHS6VA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When you spot a tick making a meal of you, the standard protocol is to grasp it&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;with forceps as close to the skin as possible and remove it. Instinct may lead a person to throw it away or squish it. But entomologists actually want you to do something else: collect the tick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SZFXCDSNJNEKHJMTDHLFSJFWGA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Virginia’s Department of Health has the Citizen Tick Survey, which asks users to submit either a photo or the tick itself and answer a few questions.

The 88-year-old man had been…&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — It was the scariest choking incident David Palumbo had ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 88-year-old man had been dining at a Providence, Rhode Island, Italian restaurant in September 2019. Now he was unconscious, with a piece of bread lodged in his windpipe. Precious minutes went by as first responders were unable to help him with CPR or the Heimlich maneuver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ambulance on the way to the hospital, the elderly man’s skin was blue, and firefighters worried he was going to die. Palumbo — a fire department captain — used a scissors-like device called Magill forceps to pull the bread from the man’s throat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We get a lot of calls in the city for choking,” many of which are resolved before emergency responders even get there, Palumbo added. “This was by far the worst one I’ve been on in my career.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the man survived and made a full recovery, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But many elderly people do not. Each year, choking claims the lives of more than 4,100 Americans who are 65 or older. It’s the most vulnerable age group, accounting for about three-quarters of U.S. choking deaths, according to federal health statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The death rate has been relatively steady, but the number has risen, as the size of the nation’s retirement-age population grows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, a number of companies are marketing antichoking devices to the elderly. Medical professionals have been debating whether to endorse the products, sold under the names LifeVac, SaveLix, VitalVac and the Dechoker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nathan Charlton, a University of Virginia professor of emergency medicine who advises the American Red Cross on first aid, said there is limited evidence for the products and that the Red Cross is still evaluating them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at choking and the best ways to prevent choking deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Choking is a danger to older adults&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choking occurs when food or some other object partially or totally blocks the windpipe, preventing oxygen from reaching the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telltale signs include someone reaching for their neck and losing the ability to speak normally. Brain damage can occur after four minutes, and death can come just a few minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older adults are at higher risk for a number of reasons. As people get older, mouth and throat muscles can weaken. Older people also make less saliva. Some chronic diseases and medications can make swallowing even harder. Dentures can be a choking risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The best ways to stop choking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choking risk can be reduced by cutting food into small pieces, chewing food slowly, drinking plenty of liquids with meals, and not laughing or talking at the same time you are chewing and swallowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone is choking, you can try perhaps the oldest form of first aid: back slaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also the Heimlich maneuver, named after the doctor credited with devising it in the 1970s. It involves standing behind the choking person, wrapping your arms around their abdomen and — with a balled fist — thrusting inward and upward. The idea is that it forces air out of the lungs, and the obstruction with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Red Cross recommends alternating back blows and abdominal thrusts in sets of five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s for situations in which someone is around to help a choking victim. But what if they are alone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible for someone try to self-administer a Heimlich by thrusting their abdomen against the back of a chair, Charlton said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makers of some the newer anti-choking devices say that’s where their products can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Elderly people probably are not capable of diving on a chair or counter,” said Arthur Lih, the founder and chief executive of LifeVac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Antichoking devices aren’t always risk-free&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They vary in design, but generally the devices look like a face mask attached to a tube or bellows, with a handle at the end. They typically sell for around $30 to $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A choking person dons the mask, pushes down on the handle and then pulls up. That is supposed to create a suction that would pull out the blockage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some research suggests at least certain devices can injure the tongue or cause bleeding and swelling in the throat. And the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has reports that some products did not generate enough suction and left people with bruising around the face, lips, and mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An injury report led the FDA to do an inspection and issue a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/dechoker-llc-614629-05102021"&gt;warning letter&lt;/a&gt; to Dechoker in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers note their products are registered with the FDA, but that’s not the same as an endorsement. Indeed, the agency last year issued a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/fda-encourages-public-follow-established-choking-rescue-protocols-fda-safety-communication"&gt;notice to consumers&lt;/a&gt; that said it has not approved antichoking devices sold over the counter, because their safety and effectiveness haven’t been established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lih said the FDA action was in response to the proliferation of antichoking devices entering the market that vary in design and quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More research is needed, choking expert says&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, the consensus — even among antichoking device manufacturers — is that back blows and abdominal thrusts should always be tried first. (The forceps that Palumbo used are not recommended for the general public.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lih said thousands of nursing homes and emergency response agencies have purchased the newer antichoking devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example: The police department in Acworth, Georgia, bought about 75 LifeVac devices after an officer last year used her personal device to save an elderly woman. They are now in every patrol car, said Sgt. Eric Mistretta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers claim the products have saved thousands of lives across multiple countries, but it’s tricky to document how well they actually work, said Dr. Cody Dunne, a University of Calgary researcher who has tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early evidence has come from case reports or small studies that used mannequins and cadavers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think the case is definitely being built,” he said, but more rigorous research is needed. For example, a larger study could compare what happened during choking incidents at nursing homes that stock the devices with those that don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunne noted, however, that evidence for the Heimlich maneuver and back slaps is evolving, too. He co-authored &lt;a href="https://www.resuscitationjournal.com/article/S0300-9572(24)00151-5/fulltext"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; last year that found back blows worked better than the Heimlich or chest compressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re only now getting good evidence on the old choking techniques, let alone these new ones,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

If it doesn’t, the U.S.’s measles elimination status could be taken away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It could be more impactful than a lot of Americans think about since we have had measles elimination status for so long,” Brittany Kmush, associate professor and graduate director of Syracuse University’s Public Health Department, told HuffPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It could affect U.S. citizens’ ability to travel to specific countries if they don’t want the risk of measles getting introduced to their country. It could affect other people’s ability to come visit the U.S. Other countries might require proof of measles vaccination before they can reenter their home country,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There could also be increased quarantine and isolation requirements, with potential economic fallout, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of this, many more people could be at risk of contracting the virus, which is considered one of the most contagious in the world. If just one person has it, up to 9 out of 10 people nearby will become infected if they are not vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“It’s just a matter of if and when an infectious individual enters one of those communities and kind of invites an outbreak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__attribution caption-cli"&gt;- William Moss, executive director of Johns Hopkins’ International Vaccine Access Center&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not just a cold for a lot of people. It can lead to phenomena and in rare cases encephalitis and death,” said Kmush. Children younger than 5 years of age are especially vulnerable to severe illness and health complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there’s still time this year to fight outbreaks. Losing the elimination status is also purposely made challenging because, unless the virus is globally eradicated ― a feat only seen with smallpox ― there’s always going to be cases brought into the U.S. from outside, said William Moss, executive director of Johns Hopkins’ International Vaccine Access Center, who co-leads the school’s measles tracking project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As long as there’s measles virus circulating somewhere in the world, there’s always going to be these importations,” he told HuffPost.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“It would be very hard to maintain measles elimination status if every time someone brought it in and there was another case, you would lose it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not outbreaks will stop before the deadline remains uncertain, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles cases in the U.S. have been dropping since their peak in March, giving hope that outbreaks may be petering out. But vaccination rates remain at their lowest in years in the U.S., reducing &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="so-called “herd immunity”" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="687148e4e4b07da2c0819b46" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;so-called “herd immunity”&lt;/a&gt; and opening the door for new outbreaks to ignite in communities that have low vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Measles cases have been dropping this year since hitting a peak in March.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s just a matter of if and when an infectious individual enters one of those communities and kind of invites an outbreak,” said Moss, while comparing the chances to a hot ember drifting from a wildfire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If it lands in a wet area, you’re not going to have an outbreak if there’s high vaccine coverage. But if it enters an area with really low vaccine coverage, you could have another really large outbreak,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With less than six months left in the year, Moss says it’s still too early to start a countdown or “really sweat about this.” He also said that even if elimination status is lost, cases are at least unlikely to return to the levels seen in the early 1990s, since vaccine levels do remain reasonably high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kmush, however, expressed more caution on the chances of elimination being a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am definitely alarmed,” she said, while pointing out that the U.S. nearly lost its elimination status in 2019 when there were fewer cases than those seen this year.

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists from the University of South Australia (UniSA) have developed a long-acting injectable formulation that delivers a steady dose of levodopa and carbidopa - two key medications for Parkinson's - over an entire week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings have been reported in the journal &lt;em&gt;Drug Delivery and Translational Research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biodegradable formulation is injected under the skin or into muscle tissue, where it gradually releases the medication over seven days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurological disorder, affecting more than 8.5 million people worldwide. Currently there is no cure and the symptoms - tremors, rigidity and slow movement - are managed with oral medications that must be taken several times a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frequent dosing is a burden, especially for elderly patients or those with swallowing difficulties, leading to inconsistent medication levels, more side effects, and reduced effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher Professor Sanjay Garg, from UniSA's Centre for Pharmaceutical Innovation, says the newly developed injectable could significantly improve treatment outcomes and patient adherence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our goal was to create a formulation that simplifies treatment, improves patient compliance, and maintains consistent therapeutic levels of medication. This weekly injection could be a game-changer for Parkinson's care," Prof Garg says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Levodopa is the gold-standard therapy for Parkinson's, but its short life span means it must be taken several times a day."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UniSA PhD student Deepa Nakmode says the in-situ implant is designed to release both levodopa and carbidopa steadily over one week, maintaining consistent plasma levels and reducing the risks associated with fluctuating drug concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"After years of focused research, it's incredibly rewarding to see our innovation in long-acting injectables for Parkinson's disease reach this stage. Our invention has now been filed for an Australian patent," Nakmode says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The injectable gel combines an FDA-approved biodegradable polymer PLGA with Eudragit L-100, a pH-sensitive polymer, to achieve a controlled and sustained drug release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extensive lab tests confirmed the system's effectiveness and safety:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;More than 90% of the levodopa dose and more than 81% of the carbidopa dose was released over seven days.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The implant degraded by over 80% within a week and showed no significant toxicity in cell viability tests.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The formulation can be easily administered through a fine 22-gauge needle, minimising discomfort and eliminating the need for surgical implant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The implications of this research are profound," Prof Garg says. "By reducing the frequency of dosing from multiple times a day to a weekly injection is a major step forward in Parkinson's therapy. We're not just improving how the drug is delivered; we're improving patients' lives."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof Garg says the technology could also be adapted for other chronic conditions such as cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, pain management, and chronic infections that require long-term drug delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system can be tuned to release drugs over a period ranging from a few days to several weeks depending on therapeutic needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UniSA scientists hope to start clinical trials in the near future and are exploring commercialisation opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Individuals with ADHD showed reduced activation in key brain areas involved in self-awareness and decision-making. Among those with ADHD, women showed more activity in several of these regions than men, pointing to possible sex-related differences in how the brain processes decisions that involve uncertainty. The research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.70215" target="_blank"&gt;Brain and Behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is typically thought of as a childhood condition, but it often continues into adulthood. Many adults with ADHD struggle with impulsivity, emotional regulation, and decision-making. These difficulties can translate into behaviors that put them at greater risk, such as reckless driving, unsafe sex, substance use, or gambling. While previous studies have explored how people with ADHD respond to the outcomes of decisions, less is known about what happens in the brain before a decision is made—especially in emotionally charged or intuitive situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand this anticipatory phase, the researchers focused on the role of unconscious and emotional processes that guide decision-making. They were particularly interested in how bodily sensations—like a quickened heartbeat or a gut feeling—might influence behavior in people with ADHD. This idea is grounded in the “somatic marker hypothesis,” which proposes that the body’s physical response to emotionally relevant information plays a role in guiding choices. The study also aimed to explore whether men and women with ADHD might show different patterns of brain activity in this context, given known sex differences in how the disorder presents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team recruited 38 adults, including 18 with ADHD (10 women and 8 men) and 20 without the disorder (10 women and 10 men). Participants were screened to ensure they met diagnostic criteria and did not have other major psychiatric or neurological conditions. Most of the participants with ADHD had been taking stimulant medication but were asked to pause use 24 hours before the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant completed a task known as the Balloon Analogue Risk Task, or BART, while undergoing brain imaging in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. The task involved watching a virtual balloon inflate on a screen and deciding when to stop it before it popped. The longer they waited, the more points they could earn—but if the balloon burst before they stopped it, they would lose all the points for that round. This version of the task was designed to encourage fast, intuitive decisions rather than deliberate calculation. Reaction time—the delay between the start of the balloon inflation and when the participant pressed the stop button—was used as a behavioral measure of risk-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While participants completed the task, researchers measured activity in their brains during the anticipation phase of each decision, before they acted. This allowed the team to examine what parts of the brain were engaged in preparing for the risky choice. They also compared results by group (ADHD vs. non-ADHD) and by sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of behavior, participants with and without ADHD showed similar reaction times on average, suggesting that the groups did not differ in observable risk-taking behavior. However, the brain imaging data told a different story. Individuals with ADHD showed significantly lower activation in two specific brain areas: the right precuneus and the right superior frontal gyrus. These areas are thought to play important roles in self-awareness, internal monitoring, and integrating emotional information—functions that are often disrupted in people with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The precuneus is involved in tasks that require self-reflection and awareness of internal states. It has also been linked to emotion processing and the ability to monitor bodily sensations. Meanwhile, the superior frontal gyrus is thought to help integrate cognitive and emotional information and is involved in controlling impulses. The researchers found that lower activity in these areas was associated with more severe ADHD symptoms, suggesting a link between brain function and the difficulties experienced by people with the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed interesting differences between men and women with ADHD. While no sex differences in brain activity were found in the group without the disorder, women with ADHD showed greater activation in several brain regions compared to men with ADHD. These included the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the insula, the caudate, the cuneus, and the precuneus. These areas are associated with emotion regulation, attention, and self-monitoring. The findings may suggest that women with ADHD engage more of their brain’s regulatory systems during the anticipation of a decision, possibly as a compensatory strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This result was unexpected, given that earlier studies have found that women with ADHD may experience more difficulties with emotional regulation and internalizing symptoms like anxiety. One possible explanation is that women with stronger emotional processing skills may show less neural activation during emotional tasks, suggesting a more efficient processing style. Alternatively, women with ADHD may develop strategies that mask their symptoms, including more active engagement of brain areas that help regulate behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also worth noting that, despite these brain differences, men and women did not show significant differences in reaction time on the task. This suggests that people may arrive at similar outward behavior through different internal processes, a finding that highlights the importance of looking beyond surface-level performance in psychological research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study offers important insights, it also has limitations. The sample size was relatively small, particularly when broken down by both sex and diagnosis, which limits how broadly the findings can be applied. Additionally, although participants were asked to stop taking ADHD medications 24 hours before the study, some effects of the medication may have lingered and influenced brain activity. The study also focused on young adults, so it may not capture how these processes change with age or in more diverse populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies with larger samples and longer medication washout periods will be important for confirming and expanding on these findings. In particular, researchers may benefit from combining brain imaging with physiological measures, like heart rate or skin conductance, to get a fuller picture of how the body and brain interact during decision-making.

It’s fast and frenetic, involving military and espionage campaigns inspired by real history. She typically spends six hours a day livestreaming to Twitch, chatting to her more than 110,000 followers from her home in Washington state. She boasts about how she’ll beat opponents, and says “bless your heart” while hurtling over rooftops to avoid clusterstrikes of enemy fire. When she’s hit, she “respawns” – or comes back to life at a checkpoint – and jumps right back into the fray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The military shooter game has a predominantly young male user base, but Statham’s Twitch handle is &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/tacticalgramma" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;TacticalGramma&lt;/a&gt; – a nod to the 60-year-old’s two grandkids. Her lifelong gaming hobby has become an income stream (she prefers to keep her earnings private, but says she has raised “thousands” for charity), as well as a way to have fun, stay sharp and connect socially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“A lot of people are surprised that someone my age is playing video games,” Statham admits. She finds the gameplay exhilarating. “When I get really good long sniper shots in, or down someone out of a helicopter, that’s pretty fun,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="fd8172d2-ccba-4904-b14c-75cbdccf1ad2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="element element--richLink element-richLink dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":5,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"The thing about ‘ageing gracefully’: whatever you call it, I’ll do it my way","elementId":"fd8172d2-ccba-4904-b14c-75cbdccf1ad2","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jul/07/the-thing-about-ageing-gracefully"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":18,"display":0,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Statham juggles in-game multitasking with live-chatting to her multigenerational streaming audience. Younger followers have taught her slang, like the gen Z shibboleth “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/jan/22/skibidi-toilet-youtube-series-viral" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;skibidi&lt;/a&gt;”. “I’ve learned some things I don’t want to learn,” she says, laughing. When she tires, she plays privately off-stream to unwind. She also exercises daily, going to the gym with her daughter as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/07/75-hard-viral-fitness-challenge-back-but-is-it-best-way-to-spend-january" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;75 Hard&lt;/a&gt; fitness challenge, to ensure gaming doesn’t displace physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Statham is one of the 57 million Americans over 50 who game, a cohort that represents 28% of roughly 205 million total US gamers, shows &lt;a href="https://www.theesa.com/resources/essential-facts-about-the-us-video-game-industry/2025-data/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recent data&lt;/a&gt; from the Entertainment Software Association. According to the ESA, nearly &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/gamings-demographic-reach-36-of-people-ages-80-to-90-play-video-games/#:~:text=The%20demographic%20spread%20of%20gaming%20is%20impressive.&amp;amp;text=Every%20year%2C%20the%20Entertainment%20Software,196%20million%2C%20a%20year%20ago." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;half&lt;/a&gt; of Americans in their 60s and 70s play some form of PC, mobile or console video game every week, as do 36% of people in their 80s.

Keep on doing what you’re doing’... things like that, that really tug at your heart,” says Will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Gaming can help people with a variety of ailments, says Dr Kris Alexander, a leading authority in video game design and associate professor of media production at Toronto Metropolitan University who helped launch &lt;a href="https://gamerx.ca/about-gamerx" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;GameRx&lt;/a&gt;, an online resource hub for information about wellness and gaming. One 2017 study found that “if you play Tetris within 48 hours of a traumatic experience, you can reduce PTSD”, he tells me. “There are studies that show that if you place burn victims in virtual reality in spaces where they’re surrounded by cold elements, you can reduce their pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Alexander believes gaming can be good for seniors; over a video call, he shows me the custom arcade cabinet he’s built to house every game he’s ever owned. “For my retirement,” he tells me. “Absolutely, when I get older, I’m going to be playing video games.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;However, common conditions like joint pain and vision decline can hinder senior gamers. As that demographic grows, so may demand for accessibility tools. And because the senior player base is relatively small, Alexander acknowledges that the high-budget gaming companies behind blockbuster titles like Call of Duty and Skyrim are unlikely to account for such needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In 2010, Will required surgery implanting a steel plate in his skull; since then, if he sits in a chair “for more than 20 or 30 minutes, everything from the shoulders down to the fingertips goes numb”, he says. Now, he uses a hand-shaped gaming keypad called the Azeron Cyborg II, which allows users with limited hand mobility or strength to position PC keys so they’re easy and comfortable to reach. Other adaptive controllers, including &lt;a href="https://www.voicebot.net/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;voice-control technology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://ablegamers.org/adaptive-gaming-equipment/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;pedals&lt;/a&gt; designed for control by foot or mouth, and&lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/08/21/xbox-accessibility-adaptive-joystick-thumbstick-toppers/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; 3D printable controller modifications&lt;/a&gt; for consoles like the Xbox and Playstation, are all making gaming increasingly accessible across playing formats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Will hopes that other seniors who see him stream will be inspired to get into gaming. “If I can do it at my age with this handicap, you can, too,” he says. After all, you’re never too old to respawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f248018d-3b1c-46a6-bfbf-67028560c94c" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.InteractiveAtomBlockElement" class="element element-atom dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figure class="interactive interactive-atom dcr-e6xisx" data-atom-id="interactives/2023/01/interactive-article-structure/portrait-image-mainmedia-feature" data-atom-type="interactive-layout"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 16:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxNb2x2ZWpCcFV2eWpnQnZ5RUZWTlJrNnU1b2xUM29ianRJcjVGdXpFSWl1aVJhUl83ZnNnajlxa3d4RjdSc0poNWVnS0ZXQUNIOHBWMXQyNE5kdnNBUUhNaVppbHVsejdjalczTEphcnVaNW9jUUc0dXlYeGZwdTFrd2l3OUVKUElveDJJNjdKOVRvZnNBamZhVA</guid></item><item><title>这种常见的止痛药可能会增加痴呆风险- Gizmodo | This Common Pain Med Could Be Raising Dementia Risk - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxNcGprYml2V0szbkxaTzB4ZE9aWXlITnA5amtEUjZqY1hCUkZHNFpZRGpFZWpfamoyTUY0aVpaQ244RmE1QXQxSWNrVzcyQXVQNkgzdXF0SWo5Ti1RRWtyVFdzVHRKeGN5ZFlWRVpQNkRITzdkdFVCMzNZcnY4US1xWVRaUUNyWkNvR0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;Chronic pain can be a debilitating experience. A common medication used to manage the condition may come with its own serious dangers, however. Recent research finds an upsetting link between the drug gabapentin and a higher risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at Case Western Reserve University led the study, which examined the medical records of people with chronic low back pain. People taking gabapentin for their back were significantly more likely to develop dementia over time compared to non-users, they found. The results suggest that doctors ought to be more aware of this potential complication, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our findings indicate an association between gabapentin prescription and dementia or cognitive impairment within 10 years,” they wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://rapm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/07/02/rapm-2025-106577"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last week in the journal Regional Anesthesia &amp;amp; Pain Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/21561-gabapentin"&gt;Gabapentin&lt;/a&gt; is an anti-seizure drug that’s also regularly used to manage nerve pain and restless leg syndrome. And it’s sometimes used to treat chronic low back pain, especially if the nerves are thought to be involved. The drug primarily works by reducing the abnormal electric activity of the brain’s neurons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As useful as gabapentin can be, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2022.910719/full"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt;—if not &lt;a href="https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/62/4/372?ijkey=ed64845ba5414944ceea85840286c984e871ac11&amp;amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha"&gt;all&lt;/a&gt;—research has suggested a possible link to dementia and cognitive impairment. To better understand this potential risk, the study researchers examined its use among chronic low back pain patients. They analyzed the medical records of over 26,000 patients diagnosed with back pain between 2004 and 2024, comparing similar groups of patients who either were or weren’t prescribed gabapentin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People who were prescribed gabapentin six or more times were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with dementia (roughly 30% more likely) and mild cognitive impairment (85% more) than those who weren’t, the researchers found. This increase in relative risk was higher in people under the age of 65 as well as in those taking 12 or more prescriptions of gabapentin (compared to people receiving fewer prescriptions).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These sorts of retrospective studies can only demonstrate a correlation between two things, not prove a clear cause-and-effect relationship. But the findings should motivate further research, both to confirm whether this link is genuine and to figure out the exact mechanisms behind it, the researchers argue. And for now, doctors should at least be more careful in how they prescribe gabapentin, including being more proactive in tracking the cognitive health of their patients taking it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our results support the need for close monitoring in adult patients prescribed gabapentin to assess for potential cognitive decline,” the study researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Unlike bubonic plague, which killed millions in medieval Europe, it can be spread through airborne droplets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While both are caused by the &lt;em&gt;Yersinia pestis&lt;/em&gt; bacterium, bubonic plague is transmitted through rodent flea bites or contact with contaminated material – and it primarily affects the lymph nodes while pneumonic plague causes pneumonia and respiratory symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Authorities said the person, whose age, name and gender have not been released, had entered the Flagstaff Medical Center emergency department and died on the same day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hospital operator Northern Arizona Healthcare&lt;a href="https://www.coconino.az.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=3242" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; said in a statement &lt;/a&gt;that “despite appropriate initial management and attempts to provide life-saving resuscitation, the patient did not recover”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The death of the Coconino county resident marks the first recorded pneumonic plague death in the county in 18 years but not the most recent human plague case in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; – the state has recorded seven cases of plague since 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Nationally, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says about seven human cases of plague are reported annually across the country, but only&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps-statistics/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; 15 plague deaths&lt;/a&gt; have been recorded in a 23-year period beginning in 2000. Most cases have been seen in rural areas in the west.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Typically, the CDC says, &lt;em&gt;Yersinia pestis&lt;/em&gt; cycles naturally among wild rodents. And while most people contract the disease though flea bites, they can become infected through exposure to sick pets, especially cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The plague death comes as officials in the county are investigating a sudden die-off of prairie dogs north-east of Flagstaff that may be caused by plague. County officials have said they do not think the human plague death and the prairie dog mortalities are related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But they also issued guidelines about how to avoid contracting the plague, including avoiding contact with wild animals, touching sick or dead animals, camping near rodent burrows, or sleeping directly on the ground. They advise using insect repellent and tucking the cuffs of your trouser leg into your socks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Coconino county health officials said the risk of human-to-human transmission of pneumonic plague is low. The last such transmission was in Los Angeles in 1924, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2595158/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according to National Institutes of Health (NIH) data.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Still, the symptoms of the Black Death – named for black spots that appeared on infected bodies – remain present. US health officials say plague symptoms typically appear within eight days after exposure and may include fever, chills, headache, weakness and muscle pain, and some may develop swollen lymph nodes (called “buboes”), most commonly in the groin, armpits or limbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But the timing of the human plague death, and the prairie dog die-off, is raising concerns. Plague is one of many diseases endemic to the south-western US, including West Nile virus, hantavirus and rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Trish Lees, communications manager for Coconino county,&lt;a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2025/07/09/prairie-dogs-dying-arizona/84512692007/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; told the Arizona Republic &lt;/a&gt;the number of prairie dogs that have died was unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 15:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQMEl2UG5lbW81SDJHLV8tRldoMGNhU2VkZW5OOW5NWWdKcGw3eVNCMHJQdTQyUG9sXzdackUzbWFjMEFXS1I3UjVBbTFLamFTZ2pVYm0wdTN3N1ItSktWYnZTNWRpclduX0VwU09kUy1meEdMalQxTGU5QS1tamZPc205eXg</guid></item><item><title>卫生部：保护自己免受蚊子的侵害-特立尼达和多巴哥新闻日报 | MoH: Protect yourself from mosquitoes - Trinidad and Tobago Newsday</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE9NTEJqdm82ai14eHo1T1dVSVRaV3J2UUU4Wkg3eHowUzMxdVZBSjFqdFhwX1VlQWZWZTNBcF9EZ1laRlE0LXJpTW85c0h3ZGpNRnlSc0xweDREcWRqSlZsTk9nYU1FcW1pbHFSS25nYWNERk5OUmJpWlNB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="article-content"&gt;

&lt;figure id="article-featured-image" class="article-featured-image"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/23238053-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="An Aedes aegypti mosquito. - AFP PHOTO  "&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;An Aedes aegypti mosquito. - AFP PHOTO  &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Health (MoH) is reminding the public to protect themselves from mosquito bites as the rainy season progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ministry, in a media release on July 13, noted the Aedes aegypti mosquito transmits mosquito-borne diseases such as Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ministry said it closely monitors any trends or changes in general population health, with specific attention to expected seasonal variations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While there has been no increase in persons presenting with dengue fever to accident and emergency departments across TT, enhanced surveillance activities by the Insect Vector Control Division (IVCD), the Epidemiology Unit and numerous satellite surveillance units within the community are ongoing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It added this is consistent with its wider established protocols utilised for the prevention, control and constant monitoring of mosquito-borne diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239531467-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dengue fever symptoms appear within 5-6 days of being bitten by an infected mosquito and can last for one-two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The symptoms include fever, headaches, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, skin rash, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ministry said, “Anyone showing signs or symptoms of dengue fever should seek immediate medical treatment at their doctor or the nearest health facility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ministry also reminded citizens the best way to reduce the spread of mosquito-borne diseases is by eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It urged the public to dispose of all unwanted articles, derelict vehicles or appliances left outdoors which can collect water and become a breeding ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It added water containers such as tanks, barrels, drums or buckets should be covered with mosquito-proof covering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are also urged to keep their surroundings clean by cutting and removing all bush or undergrowth that can harbour mosquitoes and cleaning drains and guttering to allow for the free flow of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are encouraged to use mosquito nets and insect repellent, when appropriate, as a means of personal protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who wishes to contact the IVCD for vector control measures can call 612-4823 ext 5456/5402.&lt;/p&gt;

It is not spread from person to person but rather through bites from infected mosquitoes. The insects pick up the virus from birds, the natural reservoir for the virus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Older adults, people with weakened immune systems, and those with certain chronic conditions face the highest risk of severe illness due to West Nile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even survivors of severe West Nile illness may experience long-lasting complications, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-6127023/Nebraska-man-says-paralyzed-left-partially-deaf-contracting-West-Nile-virus.html"&gt;including memory problems, chronic fatigue, muscle tremors, or permanent neurological damage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is the leading mosquito-borne disease in the US and is spread to humans through bites from infected mosquitoes. Most cases occur during mosquito season, which typically begins in the spring and lasts through the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD) Vector Control Specialist Nicholas Baldauf said: 'Generally, the species of mosquitoes that carry West Nile Virus are active from dusk to dawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Residents can prevent mosquito bites by using insect repellent on exposed skin or choosing to wear long sleeves and pants. Both methods are effective at reducing or eliminating the possibility of getting a mosquito bite.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anne Dillard, &lt;span&gt;an Atlanta woman, was left 'practically paralyzed' from the waist down after contracting West Nile virus from a mosquito bite. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She collapsed at home and was rushed to Emory University Hospital, where doctors confirmed the infection. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite retaining sensation, she lost muscle strength, leaving her unable to sit, stand, or walk. She also suffered from lethargy, loss of appetite, and a spreading rash.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Anne Dillard, from Atlanta, Georgia, revealed that she had been 'practically paralyzed' by her West Nile Virus infection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her case emerged just minutes after Dr Anthony Fauci revealed his own West Nile diagnosis, highlighting how even healthy individuals can face severe symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile John Proctor VI, an 18-year-old from Missouri became paralyzed from the neck down and relies on a ventilator to breathe after contracting West Nile virus from a mosquito bite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The previously healthy teen, who recently graduated high school and was training to become a diesel mechanic, first developed headaches and dizziness in early August before his condition rapidly worsened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within days, he suffered slurred speech, muscle weakness, and paralysis, prompting his parents to rush him to the hospital fearing a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-13575965/west-nile-virus-outbreak-officials-concerned-record-high-cases-states.html"&gt;confirmed a rare neuro-invasive form of West Nile virus, which attacks the nervous system.&lt;/a&gt; His father described the ordeal as 'out of nowhere' and said his son is now battling stroke-like symptoms and pneumonia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no cure, only rest and pain management, and recovery can take months, often with lasting effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;West Nile, first detected in 1999, now appears nationwide, causing about 2,200 severe cases and 180 deaths annually. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every spring, the ACHD treats known mosquito breeding sites with larvicide and sets traps to monitor for West Nile and other viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;John Proctor VI is on ventilator to help him breathe after being diagnosed with West Nile virus. His parents, John Proctor V and his mom stand by his bedside &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The 18-year-old had just graduated high school in the Spring &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These surveillance efforts help track disease risk and inform decisions about when additional measures, such as nighttime mosquito spraying, are necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Baldauf said: 'Mosquitoes can breed in as little as a half inch of stagnant water, so residents should pay close attention to potential breeding sites like stagnant water in tires, unused swimming pools, buckets, corrugated piping, and clogged gutters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;West Nile is primarily spread by Culex mosquitoes, which transmit the virus through their saliva. They mainly live near stagnant water sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mosquito-borne disease experts are increasingly alarmed that as global temperatures climb toward dangerous new thresholds, warmer, wetter, and more humid conditions will take hold in regions that were once too cool for large mosquito populations.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These shifting climates create ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes, extending their active season and speeding up their life cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As species like Culex mosquitoes expand into new areas, their longer lifespans and faster viral incubation times give them more opportunities to spread dangerous illnesses, not just West Nile virus, but also malaria, dengue fever, and Zika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The health department urges people to protect themselves by clearing standing water from their yards, using screens on windows and doors, and applying insect repellent to exposed skin, particularly during dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 15:04:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPbWlmaDVnWEZZRjBpUGJ4RngtUVNENmVRcE9uN3NBUmhNaGt6NU9pNk91UjFNcGlUbDRzTGdqU0JLb3ZSZE15dE5NUFY1dV8tdl9PU19SVFgyelUzYzNvenN0cWQ5dTlSM09LYVRlZUU5dGZaekl5WHFpeUZ1b05Zb2thdHl6b1p1TmFwd1psdWo0akdoanpNdF9hekZGZDlQYXZoVmJIVVVVQdIBrwFBVV95cUxOSk9YaGt1RkZHX3lvOWRBQk9sNjBid1Nqa19XbTJ5MGxGb2xsZW5mWF9FZVZvMGpsQ2wtc1hoWHNuMm1iRHpxcC1pMmdCT1d5b3U2eVBSNkFuTzhadmlLOUUwR0FkZFYydjl4SVhNTjI4bktSOV9JNy1hYVVBeUZjVk13OVFGdlFQZXdXNmRldXkxczNyVEJJdmZ1aEhpeGdaYV9qYjlndDMxSFpEVGxR</guid></item><item><title>这些类型的锻炼比跑步或步行更好地控制血压- Earth.com | These types of exercises are better than running or walking for controlling blood pressure - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxNU1hzTXlNY2R3SGxuOVdWcF9LSDN0SmdBVm5yUE9PTDNlMThCSXpuTHhUbDktcjRlTGxEelpwZ2lBbXdUdzc3LXBRZ18tcG4tdVpiTXlxaGk5dGI4MjNTUHVrck1pWFFPM1NxRW9IMEZXREJBV2R6eWtlYUhTVmZ6NjhVaUNDVi1kS0VLc0dpemlTTDZSSVFn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is medicine. Most of us have heard that advice more times than we can count. But what if the best way to treat high blood pressure doesn’t involve running miles or lifting heavy weights? What if the most effective exercise is one where you barely move at all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major new analysis published in the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/em&gt; challenges decades of assumptions about how we should approach blood pressure control. The study dives deep into nearly three decades of clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its surprising conclusion? Static strength &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-to-maximize-the-mental-health-benefits-of-exercise/"&gt;exercises&lt;/a&gt; like wall sits and planks may be more effective at reducing blood pressure than popular choices like cardio or high intensity interval training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team behind the study set out to uncover the most effective forms of exercise to prevent and manage arterial hypertension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings not only expand our understanding of how exercise influences blood pressure, but also call for a major update to current medical guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exercise-types-and-blood-pressure"&gt;Exercise types and blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers systematically reviewed 270 randomized controlled trials conducted between 1990 and February 2023. These trials involved a total of 15,827 participants and explored how various forms of exercise affect resting blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To compare outcomes fairly, the researchers categorized &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exercise-feels-better-when-its-matched-to-your-personality/"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; routines into five main groups: aerobic training, dynamic resistance training, combined training, high intensity interval training (HIIT), and isometric exercise training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aerobic training included activities such as walking, running, and cycling. Dynamic resistance training referred to exercises that involve movement and weight, like squats or push-ups. Combined training used both aerobic and resistance approaches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIIT referred to short bursts of intense exercise alternated with low intensity recovery. Finally, isometric training focused on muscle engagement without visible movement, such as wall sits or planks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers assessed both systolic blood pressure (SBP), the pressure during heartbeats, and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), the pressure between beats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using advanced statistical tools like Bayesian network meta-analysis, they compared all five exercise categories head to head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exercises-for-lower-blood-pressure"&gt;Exercises for lower blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All five types of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exercise-reduces-depression-and-anxiety-in-children-and-teens-with-mental-health-issues/"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; reduced blood pressure significantly. But not all changes were equal. Isometric training emerged as the clear leader. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of exercise led to an average systolic reduction of 8.24 mmHg and a diastolic drop of 4.00 mmHg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, combined training lowered systolic pressure by 6.04 mmHg. Dynamic resistance came next with 4.55 mmHg, followed by aerobic training at 4.49 mmHg and HIIT at 4.08 mmHg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diastolic pressure showed a similar trend. Isometric training again topped the list with a 4 mmHg reduction, followed by resistance training at 3.04 mmHg, combined training at 2.54 mmHg, aerobic training at 2.53 mmHg, and HIIT at 2.50 mmHg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overall, isometric exercise training is the most effective mode in reducing both systolic and diastolic blood pressure,” noted the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding may seem surprising at first. After all, isometric exercises don’t involve much movement. But their intensity and sustained muscle contraction appear to create powerful cardiovascular benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-best-routines-for-blood-pressure"&gt;Best routines for blood pressure &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study didn’t just stop at general categories. It also looked at specific forms of exercise within each group that helped with blood pressure management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among all the routines analyzed, wall squats produced the most powerful drop in systolic pressure, averaging 10.47 mmHg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to diastolic pressure, running delivered the biggest benefit, with an average reduction of 5.67 mmHg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other standout performers included cycling, which had stronger effects than walking in both pressure types. Walking, though widely recommended, showed the smallest benefit in this comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-benefits-for-people-with-hypertension"&gt;Benefits for people with hypertension&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, aerobic training showed greater blood pressure reductions when performed less frequently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data suggested that training three times per week produced better results than training five times per week or more. This finding applied only to aerobic training and not to the other exercise modes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts found that people with hypertension experienced the largest improvements. For them, isometric training lowered systolic pressure by as much as 12.2 mmHg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the average drop was about 6.65 mmHg in people with normal blood pressure. This suggests that the benefits are even more pronounced in those who need them most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-does-hiit-fit-in"&gt;Where does HIIT fit in?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;High intensity interval &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/to-get-fit-and-stay-healthy-walk-this-exact-distance-every-day/"&gt;training&lt;/a&gt; has gained popularity in recent years due to its time efficiency and metabolic benefits. However, in this review, HIIT ranked lowest among all exercise types for lowering systolic pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When broken down further, sprint interval training (SIT) showed some benefit, while aerobic interval training (AIT) failed to reach statistical significance for either systolic or diastolic blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors emphasized that intensity does play a role. While walking had modest effects, running and cycling offered stronger outcomes. This highlights the importance of exercise quality over quantity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though HIIT didn’t lead the rankings, the authors acknowledged its growing appeal. It remains a practical choice for people short on time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for those seeking the strongest impact on blood pressure, isometric holds may offer more powerful results in a shorter span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-need-to-update-exercise-guidelines"&gt;The need to update exercise guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current exercise guidelines for blood pressure control focus primarily on aerobic activities. But those guidelines are based on older data. This review brings in newer research, including many more trials on isometric and HIIT workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings provide a comprehensive data driven framework to support the development of new exercise guideline recommendations for the prevention and treatment of arterial hypertension,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also noted that blood pressure reductions from isometric training are comparable to those seen with standard dose antihypertensive medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That makes isometric exercise a powerful tool for people who either can’t tolerate medication or want to try non drug approaches first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some doctors may still be unfamiliar with using static holds as a prescription, the science is catching up quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field now has much more confidence in the effectiveness of these routines, thanks to a growing number of well conducted trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-simple-exercises-lower-blood-pressure"&gt;Simple exercises lower blood pressure &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the simplest exercises, those that require no equipment, no running, and very little space, may do the most for your blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall sits, planks, and other isometric exercises demand effort without motion, yet offer results that rival, and in some cases exceed, more traditional workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re managing high blood pressure or trying to avoid it, consider adding static holds to your weekly routine. The evidence is now stronger than ever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a few short sessions per week could make a measurable difference and might even take the pressure off your heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors are from &lt;a href="https://www.canterbury.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Canterbury Christ Church University&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://le.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Leicester&lt;/a&gt; in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/57/20/1317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 13:55:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxNU1hzTXlNY2R3SGxuOVdWcF9LSDN0SmdBVm5yUE9PTDNlMThCSXpuTHhUbDktcjRlTGxEelpwZ2lBbXdUdzc3LXBRZ18tcG4tdVpiTXlxaGk5dGI4MjNTUHVrck1pWFFPM1NxRW9IMEZXREJBV2R6eWtlYUhTVmZ6NjhVaUNDVi1kS0VLc0dpemlTTDZSSVFn</guid></item><item><title>科学家说，这些严重的疾病现在比心脏病发作更致命- AOL.com | Scientists Say These Serious Conditions Are Now Bigger Killers Than Heart Attacks - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxOVWhqMGtpdDFNcER0YUE0ZVBnenZPd084NzNkc2Q2MmktZ2tONUlUUU5aaWoxdHNPODBqOUNWRUI1OUhnbHJWaGVibGljbmthR0l2SGtwOFJlMnZ3WFFidjhZd25VRk5NYjVyc0V6MENXNFhVNzJFMnlTblZpMllNVg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heart attack-related deaths are down by nearly 90% since 1970, according to a new study.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;However, other heart disease-related deaths are on the rise.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We asked experts to explain the findings and how to prevent heart health issues.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study published by the American Heart Association (AHA) measured heart disease-related deaths over nearly 50 years, and while the results showed heart attack-related deaths were down 90%, other heart conditions are on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;a href="https://www.pccmn.com/elizabeth-klodas" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Elizabeth Klodas, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Elizabeth Klodas, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a preventative cardiologist and founder and chief medical officer of Step One Foods; &lt;a href="https://www.beverlyhillscardiovascular.com/dr-setareh-bio/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sam Setareh, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sam Setareh, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, director of cardiology and cardiovascular performance at Beverly Hills Cardiovascular and Longevity Institute; &lt;a href="https://lluh.org/provider/hoff-jason" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jason Hoff, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jason Hoff, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, structural interventional cardiologist and assistant professor of medicine at Loma Linda University Health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.038644" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that heart attack-related deaths decreased by almost 90% between 1970 and 2022. Specifically, heart disease accounted for 41% of deaths in 1970, and as of 2022, that number declined to 24% of all deaths. That’s the good news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, deaths from heart failure, arrhythmia (irregular heart rhythm), and hypertensive (high blood pressure-related) heart disease have increased by 146%, 106%, and 450%, respectively. In 1970, less than 9% of deaths were from those abnormalities. Essentially, the common cause of heart disease-related death has moved from “out of the blue” ischemic events like heart attacks to long-term, slow-burning heart conditions that do damage over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We asked cardiologists what the findings mean, how the statistics could continue to change over the next half-century, and most importantly, how we, as a population, can continue to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a63189227/cardiologist-recommended-heart-health-tips/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:improve heart health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;improve heart health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How did the numbers change?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early intervention, medication, and public awareness of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a25455684/heart-attack-symptoms-in-women-viral-tweet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart attack symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart attack symptoms&lt;/a&gt; have advanced greatly and contributed to the major decrease in heart attack deaths. “We are now saving people who would have died in the past. That’s great progress,” says &lt;a href="https://www.pccmn.com/elizabeth-klodas" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Elizabeth Klodas, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Elizabeth Klodas, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a preventive cardiologist and founder and chief medical officer of Step One Foods. She adds that heart attack survivors are seeking help more quickly and receiving life-saving treatment such as stents and cholesterol-controlling medications like statins. Smoking cessation has also contributed to the numbers, adds &lt;a href="https://www.beverlyhillscardiovascular.com/dr-setareh-bio/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sam Setareh, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sam Setareh, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, director of cardiology and cardiovascular performance at Beverly Hills Cardiovascular and Longevity Institute. “These gains show that when we invest in prevention, education, and access to care, we can make a real difference,” concludes &lt;a href="https://lluh.org/provider/hoff-jason" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jason Hoff, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jason Hoff, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, structural interventional cardiologist and assistant professor of medicine at Loma Linda University Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Dr. Klodas stresses that “we’ve only kicked the can down the road,” because long-term, post-cardiac event lifestyle changes that prevent chronic disease and risk factors like high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity, are lacking—diet being a huge one. “95% of Americans don’t get enough fiber, 90% take in more sodium than is recommended, the majority of U.S. adults consume less than one serving of fruit or vegetables per day,” she explains. “How can we expect our engines (hearts) to function properly if we’re constantly pouring in the wrong fuel?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Setareh adds that heart disease risk factors like obesity, diabetes, and hypertension are more prevalent now than ever. As people live longer, age-related cardiac conditions like heart failure and arrhythmias become more common. Lastly, improved diagnoses and tracking may also be capturing more deaths overall, he concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to maintain a healthy heart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the experts we spoke to have heart-healthy recommendations that are simple and align with those established by the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/nutrition-basics/aha-diet-and-lifestyle-recommendations" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:AHA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;AHA&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat a balanced whole foods and plant-forward diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limit saturated fats from processed foods and things like butter, cheese, and marbled meats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t smoke (including vaping).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limit alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get regular physicals and bloodwork to remain aware of your cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar, all of which can change without you knowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study underscores that cardiovascular disease is not a single enemy, it’s a moving target,” says Dr. Setareh. “Our strategies must evolve just as the disease burden does. It’s not just about surviving a heart attack anymore. It’s about preventing the chronic heart conditions that follow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hoff agrees. “After treating a patient for a heart attack, there is often a sense of joy and relief among the patient and their family. It feels like a crisis has been averted, and in many ways, it has. But I often tell them that this is not the finish line,” he explains. “It is the starting point for a new phase of life that requires consistent attention to risk factors, medications, lifestyle changes, and follow-up care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 13:42:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxOVWhqMGtpdDFNcER0YUE0ZVBnenZPd084NzNkc2Q2MmktZ2tONUlUUU5aaWoxdHNPODBqOUNWRUI1OUhnbHJWaGVibGljbmthR0l2SGtwOFJlMnZ3WFFidjhZd25VRk5NYjVyc0V6MENXNFhVNzJFMnlTblZpMllNVg</guid></item><item><title>更高的抗胆碱能使用与更快的行动能力和力量下降相关- Medical Xpress | Higher anticholinergic use linked to faster decline in mobility and strength - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxNNk9Hb0hWNVROckJNNGQyNFIzUExfQTlzeVBNelpYTWFic1hpWGJxSmtYVlphQWVmSmVqQ2RfdnF6ZVY3cEhReldoZkNzdkZieGt1azRXdVczaXdEdjh4UjNqMTNqWVV0ejlEN2luVDliQU5SMm1ZNzY4U3FrVHV6d0lSbnQwOUtwSDBYVWFZaWV5UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaiser Permanente Washington scientists report that higher cumulative anticholinergic exposure predicted a faster decline in gait speed and grip strength among older adults.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Older adults frequently receive prescriptions for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/anticholinergic+medications/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;anticholinergic medications&lt;/a&gt; that interfere with acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter essential for memory and muscle activation, leading to cognitive fog, confusion, and falls. Prescribing patterns are slowly shifting in response to warnings about these declines, but &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/long-term+use/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;long-term use&lt;/a&gt; is still common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have reported possible associations between anticholinergic use and slower gait speed or weaker grip strength with a pooled effect that appears small and not clinically meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Cumulative Anticholinergic Exposure and Change in Gait Speed and Grip Strength in Older Adults," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2836242" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/i&gt;, researchers used a cohort study design to assess whether cumulative anticholinergic exposure has any associated effect on annual rates of decline in gait speed and grip strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 4,283 participants enrolled in the Adult Changes in Thought study at Kaiser Permanente Washington between 1994 and 2020. Eligibility required at least 10 years of continuous health plan enrollment and a minimum of two study visits with gait speed or grip strength measurements. The mean ages were 74.3–74.5 years and 58.5–58.6% of the participants were women, across outcome samples.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Anticholinergic exposure was estimated through pharmacy dispensing records and quantified as total standardized daily dose over 10 years and mean standardized daily dose over two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weighted cumulative exposure models allowed two, four, six, eight, or 10-year assessment windows to account for time-varying effects. Gait speed and grip strength were assessed during biennial visits by standardized protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four-year weighted cumulative exposure provided the best statistical fit among models tested and indicated a decline of -0.0034 m/s per year per 1-unit increase in weighted mean standardized daily dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No significant associations appeared between conventional exposure measures and grip strength. Six-year weighted cumulative exposure did show a significant decline in grip strength (-0.0329 kg per year per 1-unit increase in weighted mean standardized daily dose).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers conclude that higher cumulative anticholinergic use was associated with greater decline rates of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gait+speed/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gait speed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/grip+strength/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;grip strength&lt;/a&gt; beyond aging and comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors warn that accumulation of small losses can become clinically meaningful over time and recommend that clinicians avoid anticholinergics when possible, prescribe the lowest effective dose, and periodically reevaluate patients to identify deprescribing opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;After centuries of mapping the human body in ever-finer detail, scientists are still making discoveries. Here we are, in 2025, and a previously unknown cellular structure that could be vital to our health has just been added to the anatomy books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The membrane-bound &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tiny-organs-hiding-in-our-cells-could-challenge-the-origins-of-life"&gt;organelle&lt;/a&gt; appears to play a huge role in helping cells sort, discard, and recycle their contents. It's called a hemifusome, and a team of scientists says it could shed new light on disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is like discovering a new recycling center inside the cell," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uvahealth.com/2025/06/25/scientists-discover-unknown-organelle-inside-our-cells/"&gt;said biophysicist Seham Ebrahim&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Virginia. "We think the hemifusome helps manage how cells package and process material, and when this goes wrong, it may contribute to diseases that affect many systems in the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only that, the discovery helps us better understand the turnover and trafficking of compounds vital to the continuing function of our cellular machinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-just-discovered-a-new-cell-it-was-predicted-100-years-ago?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scientists Just Discovered a New Cell.

(Tavakoli et al., &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59887-9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nat. Commun.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells like those making up a human body are highly complex, making it difficult to tease apart the fine structures responsible for their many processes. Even using highly sensitive technologies such as electron microscopy, samples need to be contained in a vacuum, which makes a mess of biological materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, however, a technique has emerged that allows us to probe biological samples almost down to atomic scales in three dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's called cryogenic electron tomography, or &lt;a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/au/en/home/electron-microscopy/life-sciences/cryo-tomography/workflow.html"&gt;cryoET&lt;/a&gt;. Samples are frozen in a cryogenic medium too quickly for ice crystals to form and damage the fragile tissue; then scientists can study the material at high resolution, firing a beam of electrons through the sample to take a series of two-dimensional images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these two-dimensional slices can be used to create a three-dimensional reconstruction of the specimen detailed enough to reveal the internal structure of cells and molecules in high resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the technique a team of researchers used to study different kinds of mammalian tissue – monkey, human, rat, and mouse. In all four of the cell types they studied they found multiple sacs that facilitate the formation of pairs of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicle_(biology_and_chemistry)"&gt;vesicles&lt;/a&gt; divided by a wall called a hemifusion diaphragm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These vesicles, the researchers say, act a bit like sorting receptacles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167619" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167619" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/hemifosume-diversity.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-167619" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/hemifosume-diversity.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/hemifosume-diversity-404x415.jpg 404w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/hemifosume-diversity-600x617.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167619" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Hemifusome structures can take a variety of different shapes.

"The hemifusome is like a loading dock where they connect and transfer cargo. It's a step in the process we didn't know existed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers performed experiments with gold nanoparticles and cultured human cells to determine whether the way hemifusomes take up materials from their surroundings is similar to what has been observed in other cells. Interestingly, it appears that hemifusomes behave differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More work needs to be done to figure out what the organelle does, how it does it, and how it fits into the bigger picture of cellular machinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research could also reveal the role hemifusomes play in disease, since an inability to process cellular cargo properly can cause significant health setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're just beginning to understand how this new organelle fits into the bigger picture of cell health and disease.

That could lead us to new strategies for treating complex genetic diseases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59887-9"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Disrupted circadian rhythms from artificial light at night can affect immune function, neuroinflammation, metabolism, sleep, and mood.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Dr. Randy Nelson’s lab is testing real-world solutions like blocking disruptive light in ICUs and using bright blue light visors for night shift nurses.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;He advocates for better awareness of time-of-day effects in research and everyday life.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Simple changes like limiting nighttime blue light could help protect your brain’s natural rhythms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORGANTOWN, W.V. —&lt;/strong&gt; It’s 2 a.m., and instead of sleeping, someone is scrolling through their phone under bright hospital lights, working the night shift at a factory, or binge-watching Netflix until dawn. What seems like harmless modern behavior might actually be wreaking havoc on the brain in ways scientists are only beginning to understand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Randy Nelson, who chairs the Department of Neuroscience at West Virginia University, has spent the last 15 years investigating something that affects millions of Americans daily: how exposure to artificial light at night disrupts our internal biological clocks and fundamentally alters &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/brain-function/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain function&lt;/a&gt;. His research examines how disrupted circadian rhythms affect “immune function, neuroinflammation, metabolism, sleep, and mood.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nelson studies shift workers and hospitalized patients, groups that face constant exposure to artificial light during hours when the body expects darkness. His work extends beyond simple sleep problems: he’s investigating how &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/light-pollution/"&gt;light pollution&lt;/a&gt; might be contributing to depression, anxiety, and metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-your-brain-expects-darkness"&gt;Why Your Brain Expects Darkness&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Humans evolved over millions of years with predictable cycles of light and darkness. Our brains contain what scientists call a “master clock.” It’s a small cluster of cells that coordinates when hormones are released, when body temperature changes, and when different organs become active or inactive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When artificial light hits our eyes during nighttime hours, it confuses this internal timing system. The brain receives mixed signals about what time it is, disrupting the natural rhythm that governs nearly every biological process in the body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nelson’s laboratory work focuses on measuring how this disruption affects the brain and body. His studies examine changes in immune function, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/inflammation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;inflammation levels&lt;/a&gt;, and the production of hormones that regulate mood, hunger, and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/stress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stress response.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Encouraging earlier bedtimes and healthy sleep patterns is especially important for still-developing brains. (Syda Productions/Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shift-workers-face-the-greatest-risk"&gt;Shift Workers Face the Greatest Risk&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nearly 15% of American workers — including &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/nurses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nurses&lt;/a&gt;, factory workers, security guards, and others — work non-traditional hours that put them in chronic conflict with their natural body clocks. Nelson’s research shows this group faces elevated risks for health problems that extend far beyond feeling tired.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The biological effects are measurable. When people are exposed to light during natural sleeping hours, their bodies show changes in how they process blood sugar, potentially increasing &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; risk. The disruption also affects hormones that control hunger and feelings of fullness, which may explain higher obesity rates among shift workers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brain inflammation, a factor linked to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, also increases when circadian rhythms are disrupted. Stress hormones that normally follow predictable daily patterns become erratic, affecting everything from blood sugar control to immune system function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-testing-real-world-solutions"&gt;Testing Real-World Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nelson is currently conducting trials that could change how hospitals and workplaces approach lighting. “We have two clinical trials in which we are examining the role of blocking the disruptive effects of light at night on clinical outcomes after stroke and cardiac surgery in the intensive care units,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trials also test bright &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/blue-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blue light&lt;/a&gt; devices designed to help reset night shift nurses’ body clocks, potentially improving their sleep, thinking abilities, and mood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These studies represent an important step toward applying laboratory discoveries to real-world medical care. Success could lead to new hospital policies and better support systems for the millions of Americans &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/night-shift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;who work overnight shifts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simple changes might make a difference: using amber or red lights in evening hours, installing blackout curtains, and designing workplaces that consider natural body rhythms rather than fighting against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-time-of-day-factor"&gt;The Time-of-Day Factor&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nelson advocates for something that might seem minor but could have major implications: requiring scientists to report what time of day they conduct experiments. “The answer to an experimental question may depend in part on the time-of-day when the question is asked,” he notes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Currently, most research papers don’t include this information, even though body rhythms can significantly influence experimental results. This oversight could be affecting the reliability of scientific studies across many fields.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For shift workers, potential solutions include specialized &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/morning-blue-light-therapy-boosts-sleep-quality-older-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;light therapy&lt;/a&gt;, strategic timing of sleep aids like melatonin, and workplace policies that acknowledge biological realities. Some companies have begun installing “circadian lighting” systems that automatically adjust light color and intensity throughout the day to match natural patterns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research even raises broader questions about how modern society is structured. Should cities consider the health impacts of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/outdoor-lights-diabetes-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;street lighting&lt;/a&gt;? Could building codes support natural &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sleep-wake cycles&lt;/a&gt;? Should families rethink how much lighting to use in the house after sunset?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nelson’s research represents a growing field of study examining how modern environments affect human biology. As his clinical trials progress and more scientists recognize the importance of circadian timing in research, we may see new approaches to everything from hospital design to workplace policies. The challenge now is translating these scientific insights into practical changes that can help millions of people living and working in our 24/7 world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This article is based on an extensive interview with Dr. Randy Nelson, a circadian rhythm researcher at West Virginia University, published in Brain Medicine journal. Nelson’s research combines laboratory studies using animal models with clinical trials in humans. His laboratory measures immune function, neuroinflammation, metabolism, sleep patterns, and mood changes in response to disrupted light-dark cycles. Current clinical trials examine whether blocking disruptive light in intensive care units improves patient outcomes and whether light therapy devices can help reset night shift nurses’ circadian rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nelson’s research demonstrates that artificial light exposure at night disrupts circadian rhythms and causes measurable changes in brain function and behavior. His studies show increased neuroinflammation, altered immune function, disrupted metabolism, and mood changes. The research indicates that circadian disruption affects stress hormone production, glucose metabolism, and hunger-regulating hormones. Clinical trials are ongoing to test whether interventions can improve outcomes for medical patients and shift workers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The interview format means specific details about sample sizes, statistical significance, and experimental controls are not provided. Nelson references “nearly 500 papers” published during his career, but the interview doesn’t detail individual study methodologies or limitations. The clinical trials mentioned are ongoing, so results are not yet available. The research focuses primarily on shift workers and hospitalized patients, which may limit broader applicability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-funding-and-disclosures"&gt;Funding and Disclosures&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research is supported by NIH grant R21CA276027 and NSF grant 2242771. Nelson is also Co-Investigator on an NSF Track 1 award called “West Virginia Network for Functional Neuroscience and Transcriptomics.” The author affirmed that the interview content was free from conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers are exploring biological differences, focusing on X chromosome-linked genes and hormonal shifts like menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Declines in estrogen during menopause may leave the brain more vulnerable to the tau protein tangles that drive cognitive decline. Understanding these sex-based differences could lead to better, more personalized treatments for Alzheimer’s and related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Women’s two X chromosomes and imperfect silencing may influence Alzheimer’s risk through immune and brain-related genes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Menopause-related drops in estrogen appear to increase vulnerability to tau protein tangles in the brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hormone therapy after age 70 is linked to higher tau buildup and cognitive decline, emphasizing careful timing of interventions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Harvard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A neglected piece of the Alzheimer’s puzzle has been getting increased scientific attention: why women are twice as likely as men to develop the disease.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One might be tempted to explain the disparity as a natural consequence of women living longer. But those studying the disease say that wouldn’t account for such a large difference, and they’re not precisely sure what would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many factors may be at play, researchers are zeroing in on two where the biological differences between women and men are clear: chromosomes and menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women have two X chromosomes, and men have an X and a Y. Differences between genes held on the X and Y chromosomes, researchers say, may give women an increased chance of developing Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menopause, when production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone declines, is another clear difference between the sexes. Those hormones are widely known for their roles in the reproductive system, but estrogen also acts on the brain, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever’s at play is likely part of deeper neurological processes, researchers say, pointing to similar sex-related differences in other conditions. Multiple sclerosis and migraine, for example, are both more common in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease, brain tumors, and epilepsy, by contrast, are more common in men. In some cases — like migraine in women and Parkinson’s in men — increased severity accompanies increased incidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Epidemiologically, we see that for almost all neurological diseases, there are differences in how many biological women and men are affected,” said Anna Bonkhoff, resident and research fellow in neurology at Harvard Medical School and Mass General Brigham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a tendency, for example, in MS and migraine for more females to be affected, while it’s the contrary for brain tumors and Parkinson’s. Just based on these numbers, you get the feeling that something needs to underlie these differences in terms of the biology.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The basic building blocks are genes, which in humans are arranged on 46 chromosomes, organized into 23 pairs. One of those pairs — XX in women and XY in men — contain the genes that define sex-based characteristics, differences that are key areas of exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The X and Y chromosomes differ significantly, Bonkhoff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The X chromosome is rich in genes, while the Y chromosome has lost a significant number over the millennia. Having two X chromosomes, though, doesn’t mean that women have a double dose of the proteins and other gene products produced by those genes, because one of the X chromosomes is silenced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That silencing, however, is imperfect, Bonkhoff said, leaving some genes on the silenced X chromosome active. Studies have shown that genes on the X chromosome are related to the immune system, brain function, and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that biological men and women differ by the number of X chromosomes,” said Bonkhoff, lead author of a recent review article in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt; that examined sex-related differences in Alzheimer’s disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of genes for the immune system and regulating brain structure are located on the X chromosome, so the dosages differ to certain degrees between men and women. That seems to have an effect.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key difference between men and women relates to their hormones. All humans have three sex hormones: estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. In women, estrogen and progesterone dominate, while in men testosterone dominates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When one looks at changes between men and women with respect to hormones and aging, menopause is a significant nexus over the course of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Menopause is part of the puzzle, probably one of the bigger ones,” Bonkhoff said. “I’m not saying it’s the only one — aging is relevant by itself, and there’s a lot of interesting research looking at what aging does to the immune system that seems to have implications for cognitive changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women typically go through menopause from their mid-40s to mid-50s. During that time, their ovaries stop producing estrogen and progesterone, resulting in the characteristic symptoms of menopause, like hot flashes, emotional changes, cessation of menstruation, difficulty sleeping, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, Rachel Buckley, associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School, and her colleagues followed that hormonal thread in a study that examined the impact of hormone replacement therapy and the accumulation of the protein tau in the brain, a key characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buckley, who is also an investigator in neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital, found that women who were receiving hormone replacement therapy later in life, after age 70, had significantly higher levels of tau accumulation, and suffered higher cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result, she said, supports the “timing” approach to hormone therapy, which holds that hormone replacement therapy can safely be used to ease the symptoms of menopause, but should not be continued into old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing theory arose in response to a study by the federally funded Women’s Health Initiative in the early 2000s, which showed an association between women taking hormone replacement therapy and increased cognitive decline. That was contrary to expectations from earlier studies that indicated estrogen had protective effects on cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later studies, however, showed that hormone therapy appeared to be protective in younger women but was associated with declining cognition in women age 65 and up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buckley’s research took that work a step further, linking it to physiological changes in the brain. Alzheimer’s disease involves the accumulation of amyloid beta into characteristic plaques in the brain — considered an important hallmark of the condition. Those plaques spur the development of tangles of a protein called tau, which then sparks damaging inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buckley’s research showed that hormone therapy among older women was associated with an increase in tau and with cognitive decline. It was not associated with an increase in amyloid beta, which today is a common therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science Advances &lt;/em&gt;in March and funded in part by the National Institute on Aging, allowed Buckley, Gillian Coughlan, first author and instructor in neurology, and their colleagues to highlight the role of hormone replacement in the accumulation of tau tangles in older women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Buckley said the study also highlights significant areas where work remains to be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The database used for the study didn’t have information about variables that may be important, such as a woman’s reproductive history, information on when the replacement therapy was initiated, and the length of hormone therapy use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the importance of that missing data, Buckley said, is a step forward even though the fact that it’s missing limits the conclusions that can be made in her study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To remedy that, Buckley is planning her own study that will gather what she believes is all the pertinent data, including reproductive history, and details of hormone therapy use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We work with a lot of secondary data that already exists, and that’s great but there are limitations to what we can do with it,” Buckley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re trying to see if we can set up a new study design where we can really look at the time of menopause, what is changing in the blood, what is changing in the brain, what is changing in cognition, and how that might be associated with later life risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sussing out how biological sex affects risk of Alzheimer’s disease, Bonkhoff and Buckley said, can help us understand Alzheimer’s more generally. That understanding, they said, has the potential to lead to new pathways of treatment and prevention of a disease that, despite decades of research and encouraging recent progress, is still poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s an important aim in medicine to understand and then to innovate in how we can prevent or treat,” Bonkhoff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we can find ways to incorporate sex difference to optimize the treatment for individuals, both men and women, that is the overarching goal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alvin Powell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Alvin Powell – Harvard&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adt9243" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sex differences in age-associated neurological diseases—A roadmap for reliable and high-yield research&lt;/a&gt;” by Anna Bonkhoff et al. &lt;em&gt;Science Advance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex differences in age-associated neurological diseases—A roadmap for reliable and high-yield research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once taken into consideration, sex differences in neurological diseases emerge in abundance: (i) Stroke severity is significantly higher in females than in males, (ii) Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology is more pronounced in females, and (iii) conspicuous links with hormonal cycles led to female-specific diagnoses, such as catamenial migraines and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these differences receive increasing attention in isolation, they likely link to similar processes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, this review aims to present an overview of the influences of sex chromosomes, hormones, and aging on male and female brains across health and disease, with a particular focus on AD and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus here on advancements across several fields holds promise to fuel future research and to lead to an enriched understanding of the brain and more effective personalized neurologic care for all.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 12:34:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE1uWUhNa2ZkNnVZQzEyd1BsRFV4eHFWUFFZWGl6ZEpCREIyZmpvUUwxcHJZTTI2ZWhfc3VEa2ltVi1WaXNyTncyTUJQU0dDRWtIUDM4VWdnWldZanQyZ2FRZ1M5Y2ZVUlFUOFY2ckk1MA</guid></item><item><title>“卵巢可以发育牙齿” ：外科医生正在揭示他们通常不会告诉其他人的人体秘密- BuzzFeed | "Ovaries Can Develop Teeth": Surgeons Are Revealing Secrets About The Human Body That They Don't Typically Tell Other People - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTFBxNy1pemhSMkxlRnNOVHFlSDNQNW9SQXA5WVdxNkZhM2JORGQ3Yi13RGtreDROSGdEeDVmTFNWNkxmR25mT21GNGVXQlBKdEhXNWhpUDhTTDlxWDhzOFJBc25fS1BjY0NJRExBbkMwZmQ3RXlMbmxDRXAxVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research led by Sichuan University in China has revealed that bedtime antihypertensive medication dosing improves nocturnal blood pressure control over morning dosing in patients with hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Hypertension is a major global health challenge. In China, nearly 300 million individuals live with elevated blood pressure and fewer than 17% achieve adequate control. Nocturnal pressure is often the most difficult to manage and can be a better predictor of heart attack and stroke than daytime readings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have examined the optimal timing for antihypertensive medication with conflicting evidence and substantial variability in study outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Morning vs. Bedtime Dosing and Nocturnal Blood Pressure Reduction in Patients With Hypertension: The OMAN Randomized Clinical Trial," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2836172" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/randomized+clinical+trial/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;randomized clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; to compare bedtime versus &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/morning/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;morning&lt;/a&gt; administration of antihypertensive drugs on nocturnal blood pressure reduction and circadian rhythm control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across 15 hospitals in China, the trial enrolled 720 participants aged 18 to 75 years who either had never received antihypertensive treatment or had discontinued treatment for at least two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were randomly assigned to groups receiving antihypertensive medication either in the morning (6:00–10:00 AM) or at bedtime (6:00–10:00 PM). All patients received a single-pill combination of olmesartan (20 mg) and amlodipine (5 mg), with dosage adjustments based on ambulatory and office blood pressure monitoring every four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;After 12 weeks, the bedtime dosing group showed a greater reduction in nighttime &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/systolic+blood+pressure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;systolic blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, with a between-group difference of -3.0 mm Hg (95% CI, -5.1 to -1.0 mm Hg). Nighttime diastolic blood pressure also decreased more in the bedtime dosing group (-1.4 mm Hg; 95% CI, -2.8 to -0.1 mm Hg).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nighttime systolic blood pressure control rates were higher with bedtime dosing (79.0%) compared with morning dosing (69.8%). Office systolic blood pressure control rates were 88.7% in the bedtime group and 82.2% in the morning group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bedtime dosing also lowered morning systolic and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/diastolic+blood+pressure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;diastolic blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; with fewer dose escalations. No significant differences were observed in the incidence of nocturnal hypotension or reported adverse effects between groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers conclude that bedtime dosing provided better nocturnal blood pressure control and improved circadian rhythm without reducing the efficacy of mean daytime or 24-hour blood pressure or increasing the risk of nocturnal hypotension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings support the potential advantages of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bedtime/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bedtime&lt;/a&gt; administration and offer evidence to guide future research on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/antihypertensive/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;antihypertensive&lt;/a&gt; chronotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

You’re also more likely to lose muscle mass and strength or to develop osteoarthritis, and both can put more stress on the muscle you do have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="COV5MCEVYZES3P2UYBOX2H2FFE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As a result, up to 60 percent of older adults live with persistent muscle pain, according to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8034863/" target="_blank"&gt;2020 review in the journal Medical Clinics of North America.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DUKQVJBPE5GHDMP4KASKRTHACY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But there’s a lot you can do to ease that discomfort. Here’s a look at sources of muscle pain and the best routes to feeling better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QF65MQC7MFGXROGK22RJ2V7WLM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These “pulled” muscles are often more common later in life, Gardner says. The best treatment is a day or two of rest, ice, compression and elevation. But that doesn’t mean lying in bed all day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CTNE3QKEU5HYXC3QQ4VUYPIJWQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Try taking a short walk or marching in place. “Light activity can help reduce muscle pain and stiffness because it encourages blood flow to the area,” she says. After about three days, try to resume your normal activities, but if it hurts, scale back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K4R6V7Y5M5G5JM4BJZCICVQYRM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You can do a bit of self-massage, too. This increases blood flow to the muscle, which can reduce inflammation and speed healing, says Tiffany Shubert, chair of the American Physical Therapy Association Geriatrics/National Council on Aging Task Force. One method: Put a tennis ball between your body and a wall or the floor, then roll up and down on the sore area. You can also roll a foam roller on tight, achy muscles. But avoid massage guns. “There’s always the concern it could be too rough for some older adults and lead to a fracture,” Shubert says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XKJ2QEDTZ5CULE4MZB72UIUPVI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Feel like you need something more for the pain short term? Over-the-counter oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen (Advil and generic) can raise the likelihood of gastrointestinal bleeding in older adults. Instead, use acetaminophen (Tylenol and generic) or an OTC topical NSAID cream such as diclofenac. “Follow dosing labels carefully,” Gardner says. “A small amount is still absorbed by the bloodstream into the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EFHO74UVBFBPXFZJ5CUZLLEJ5I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Another option is a topical cream or ointment containing the herb arnica, says Benjamin Kligler, a professor of family and community medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8537440/" target="_blank"&gt;2021 review published in the journal Medicines&lt;/a&gt; found that arnica may be comparable to standard medications for muscle strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DH52YFSQLVCHLIUJRFNINPWW2M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If your pain persists for more than a couple of days or eases and then returns, ask your doctor about seeing a physical therapist. “There may be other factors driving your muscle pain, for example, underlying arthritis or weak hip muscles that place more stress on your knees,” Gardner says. A PT can figure out the cause and recommend appropriate strengthening and stretching exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UYHL6DPJWFAAFHQITVH552K3PM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aches from respiratory infections&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CEL277I2TBBVRMIECTZAMTRYV4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you have the flu or covid-19, the muscles all over your body may really hurt. “Older adults often feel muscle aches more intensely during a virus than younger ones, as their muscles tend to be tighter and weaker,” says Michael Hochman, an internist in Oak Park and Sunland, Calif.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QVL43KETC5A3XPQFCL43IZ6NP4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;What to do: Call your doctor for an antiviral prescription (Paxlovid for covid-19 or Tamiflu for the flu). This may ease symptoms and help you recover faster. And while you’re sick, drink plenty of fluids because dehydration can worsen achiness, he says. Water is best. You can also take the over-the-counter pain reliever acetaminophen (Tylenol and generic) to ease aches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YR4BS27UB5GYFOP2QMYT4DG7BU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;More than 32 percent of people between the ages of 70 and 79 experience uncomfortable nighttime leg cramps at least five times a month. “It’s very common because older adults are more vulnerable to factors that raise the risk of muscle cramps, such as dehydration or electrolyte imbalances,” Kligler says. The natural shortening of your tendons as you age can also make the cramps more likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NGDMWZA7HBCWBK5SHWC72MR75U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If a painful leg cramp wakes you up at night, Kligler recommends stretching your calf. You can do this while standing up or even while lying down in bed. For the latter, with the affected leg straight in front of you and flat on the bed, point your toes toward the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EQSFNPFRHNBXTCITKJ7U2O7YE4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If that doesn’t provide sufficient relief, try walking around your home until the cramp subsides. After that, elevate your leg to get more blood flowing to the area. You can also take a hot shower or a warm bath (add in some Epsom salts if you like), or use a heating pad on the area that’s cramped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AM6QFKQBDBEHNGACTXKG6ABHGY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you’re prone to nighttime muscle cramps, stretch your calves and hamstrings at least once a day. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8127570/" target="_blank"&gt;2021 Cochrane review&lt;/a&gt; concluded that while this won’t eliminate cramps, it may make them less severe. Kligler also recommends a supplement of about 100 to 200 mg of magnesium before bedtime. But check with your doctor first because magnesium can cause diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4WA33NNBARFV7MQ5HERH6PUODQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you feel achy every day for more than a couple of weeks, see your doctor. You may have a medical problem that needs attention. For widespread pain, for instance, your doctor may have you evaluated by a rheumatologist for fibromyalgia, a chronic condition marked by deep muscle aches and stiffness. “It often starts in your neck or shoulders before spreading to your middle and lower back, arms and legs, and chest wall,” says Don Goldenberg, a rheumatologist and professor emeritus of medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston. You may also notice specific tender points near joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZBTVMYBFZVFXRNJYTM7KVPWQ3Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“One of the best treatments available is cognitive behavior therapy, not because fibromyalgia is ‘all in your head’ but because it gives you coping tools to help live with the condition,” Goldenberg says. Low-impact activities such as walking, water aerobics, tai chi and gentle yoga may help, too. “We know that people who do moderate exercise regularly with fibromyalgia have lower pain levels.” You may also need an antidepressant that targets the brain chemicals that process pain. If that doesn’t work, your doctor may recommend an anticonvulsant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XIF2D4IVCVAE7E3OAHLBUY6ZPU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Another condition that can cause muscle pain is polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), which occurs almost exclusively in people over age 50, Goldenberg says. “We think of it anytime we have an older adult complain of new-onset aches, pain and stiffness in their neck, shoulders, upper back and hips, particularly in the morning,” he says. Treatment is a long-term (a year or two, or even more) low dosage of a steroid such as prednisone. Your doctor should also monitor you closely for sudden loss of sight, he says. This, and symptoms such as new headaches and high fever, may be signs of a serious condition called giant cell arteritis, which &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9909075/" target="_blank"&gt;one small 2023 study&lt;/a&gt; found was present in more than 40 percent of people with PMR. Treatment for this is usually a short course of high-dose steroids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y43R7NQ2BNBZDGL54HJMANMSK4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Statin drugs for lowering cholesterol, such as atorvastatin (Lipitor and generic) and rosuvastatin (Crestor and generic), can cause a rare side effect of muscle pain. This occurs in fewer than 5 percent of people, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/s0140-6736(22)01545-8/fulltext#" target="_blank"&gt;2022 paper&lt;/a&gt;, but can be quite uncomfortable. “Patients often tell me that it feels like they got hit with a truck — it’s a whole-body, flu-like experience,” says Chad Worz, chief executive of the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XDNLGJCAAZEYXHHZGGTQL4DFOU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you notice this kind of pain, let your doctor know. They may want you to stop taking your statin drug for about a week, says John Batsis, a geriatrician at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill. If your symptoms improve, the medication was probably the culprit. You can then work with your doctor to reduce the dosage of your current medication or try a different statin altogether. And if these steps don’t help, talk to your doctor about other options for &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/high-cholesterol/your-guide-to-cholesterol-control-a2665297083/" target="_blank"&gt;managing cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p id="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" class="wpds-c-esEUdQ wpds-c-esEUdQ-hqvHjm-isBold-false wpds-c-esEUdQ-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Copyright 2024, Consumer Reports Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NGIOUE72HRGJHDJS2MZ36HBWDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Consumer Reports is an independent, nonprofit organization that works side by side with consumers to create a fairer, safer and healthier world.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jo Frost, best known as Supernanny, has opened up about a life-threatening health condition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've survived more anaphylactic shocks than I'm prepared to go into detail about right now.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And, driving home just how life-threatening anaphylactic shock can be, she said:  'If you ignore the severity of this medical condition, it's as bad as shoving a loaded gun in my face.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Frost continued that she is one of 'millions' of people who '&lt;span&gt;live cautiously and anxiously...with not nearly enough compassion, education and empathy' from people who do not suffer from extreme allergic reactions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She added that she—and no doubt other sufferers—feel forced to take full responsibility for what they put in their bodies as others do not take allergies seriously, calling out 'lazy' restaurant staff and large food corporations who are not transparent about their production methods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I'm unapologetic for my medical condition. I did not ask for it, and it does not define who I am and the impact that I make in the world daily,' she said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'But it does impact how I live my life daily, like the precautions I take, the energy I have to use to discern with hyper vigilance whether you do know what you're talking about when you're in a restaurant or just winging it, because you can't be arsed to go to the back of the kitchen and truly ask the chef.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She also slammed food manufacturers who 'dodge accountability legally and put your greed before my safety' by placing "it may contain" labels on their products.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'It means that your inclusion of health and safety standards doesn't apply to me, just non anaphylaxis people out there,' she said.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Frost first shot to fame in 2004 when she fronted international hit show Supernanny &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In the show, she helped parents who were at the end of their tether with their unruly kids &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And by the way, I speak on behalf of those who also have coeliac disease too, because we are all not faddy eaters, I'm not looking to be treated special. I'm looking to be treated with the same dignity and attentiveness as you just showed others.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/health/article-14542313/coeliac-disease-symptoms-Olympic-rebecca-adlington-diagnosis.html"&gt;Coeliac disease&lt;/a&gt; is a genetic autoimmune condition which means it develops when your body decides that healthy cells are foreign and so it sends antibodies out to 'protect' your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When someone has coeliac disease, their body triggers an immune response to gluten entering their systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During this process, antibodies are released that damage the lining of their gut and can cause a number of unpleasant symptoms, some of which are not even tummy-related. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-ffacf770-6093-11f0-a21b-5ddd939b6e9d" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14903303/Supernanny-Jo-Frost-reveals-little-known-health-condition-kill-bad-shoving-loaded-gun-face.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;Symptoms of anaphylaxis &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swelling of your throat and tongue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty breathing or breathing very fast&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty swallowing, tightness in your throat or a hoarse voice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wheezing, coughing or noisy breathing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling tired or confused&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling faint, dizzy or fainting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skin that feels cold to the touch&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Blue, grey or pale skin, lips or tongue – if you have brown or black skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Source: NHS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Frost rounded off her impassioned post by urging establishments to improve the training of their staff, and for food firms to generally do better at creating products that everyone can enjoy without fear of falling ill or dying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I don't need your mumbling insults, your passive aggressive comments or your ignorance, just your need to be willing to learn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Educate your staff, change your policies, menus, work spaces, school training, event spaces for all, to champion children who are all ours, really, in this world, and show empathy and understanding to each other.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2012, she told US magazine &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.allergicliving.com/2013/07/16/profile-tvs-nanny-jo-frost-on-her-allergies/"&gt;Allergic Living&lt;/a&gt; that she had been hospitalised by her allergies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The worst I’ve dealt with left me in hospital for a couple of days and my blood pressure went really low. [This incident happened three years ago, brought on by a restaurant meal.] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had been told, very confidently, that were no nuts in a particular meal, and there were. It left me never in the same place again.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added that the experience had made her much more cautious about eating out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What has changed is my ability to trust those who may not be fully informed. You have to read between the lines. At a restaurant if they say, “I think so,” that is not – “I know so”,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now in a restaurant, I ask: “Are you sure?” and “Can I see the chef?” because I have to be in control of my life and responsible for my life, so I will do what’s necessary to do that.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added that while filming Supernanny, all foods which could cause an allergic reaction—and pets—were removed from the family's home and it underwent a very deep clean before shooting began. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Frost added: 'I don’t see myself as a sufferer. I just know there are certain things that I can’t do. For instance, I would love to go horseback riding, but I can’t; it’s life or death. So there are things you can do and things you can’t. For instance, I waterski and cycle, things like that.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 11:26:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>专家无法忍受的10个更年期迷思-《西雅图时报》 | 10 menopause myths the experts can’t stand - The Seattle Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxPcFNqMnZQYndFSnZGNFdKMnp2MmhXY1AtMWJDd1BjUzVRZVEwMVZVcHVWMHlseFJ5VWhpbVFpQTMtTXFxUnl6cDQxLWZfd0VfWnZrZnA4d09Sb1dXNWJzZVIxYThIRkhOZnI5Yy04TFplX1lsVUE2TjcxZ1NlWXhzNXg3VW9UZmVmbHRONEM2WFYtT200LWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxPcFNqMnZQYndFSnZGNFdKMnp2MmhXY1AtMWJDd1BjUzVRZVEwMVZVcHVWMHlseFJ5VWhpbVFpQTMtTXFxUnl6cDQxLWZfd0VfWnZrZnA4d09Sb1dXNWJzZVIxYThIRkhOZnI5Yy04TFplX1lsVUE2TjcxZ1NlWXhzNXg3VW9UZmVmbHRONEM2WFYtT200LWc?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;10 menopause myths the experts can’t stand&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/stories/CAAqNggKIjBDQklTSGpvSmMzUnZjbmt0TXpZd1NoRUtEd2lUd3F2T0RoSE1VZXpCTjdabm55Z0FQAQ?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US:en&amp;amp;oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;View Full Coverage on Google News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 11:00:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPcFNqMnZQYndFSnZGNFdKMnp2MmhXY1AtMWJDd1BjUzVRZVEwMVZVcHVWMHlseFJ5VWhpbVFpQTMtTXFxUnl6cDQxLWZfd0VfWnZrZnA4d09Sb1dXNWJzZVIxYThIRkhOZnI5Yy04TFplX1lsVUE2TjcxZ1NlWXhzNXg3VW9UZmVmbHRONEM2WFYtT200LWc</guid></item><item><title>5种不会刺激血糖的天然甜味剂- Vogue | 5 Natural Sweeteners That Won’t Spike Your Glucose - Vogue</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZkFVX3lxTFAtUmVJUnZ2WHZqRzVCQ0FwRWh6LXJTS0RwUGlqREt3TFMzemJYUU1waWZkTmloNWt0OTVPZ2x0QUtVZnNkTkd0bnpCU2FrYkp1TzZFVUR4SmIzNjdkV2NzdW5sTTc2QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no way around it—many of us consume far too much sugar. Though the maximum recommended daily amount of sugar is 9 teaspoons, most adults in the United States average a whopping 17 teaspoons each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, a lot of that sugar is consumed accidentally. Often, it is &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/how-to-avoid-hidden-sugar-in-foods" target="_blank"&gt;hidden in plain sight&lt;/a&gt;. According to research, between 60% and 80% of packaged foods and beverages sold in grocery stores contain added sugar. And it’s not just in the obvious “sweet” foods like cookies, cakes, and chocolates either; even so-called savory foods like dips, sauces, and soups are often covertly laced with sugar in some form. Think: high fructose corn syrup, fruit juice, and aspartame. Sugar is so omnipresent in our foods that it insidiously creeps into our diets and becomes &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/toxic-relationship-with-sugar" target="_blank"&gt;addictive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there are some things you can do to &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/giving-up-sugar" target="_blank"&gt;cut back&lt;/a&gt;. First, learn to read ingredient labels and remember that anything that ends in “-ose” is usually a form of sugar—i.e. glucose and sucrose. Next, avoid processed foods as much as possible. And, lastly, find substitutes for white sugar that won’t cause blood glucose to spike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latter isn’t as hard as it sounds. Many natural sweeteners come without the glucose-spiking qualities of conventional white sugar. Here, we’ve listed some favorites along with their &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/blood-sugar-health" target="_blank"&gt;glycemic indexes&lt;/a&gt; (GI)—a.k.a. the rate at which the &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/glucose-energy-tips" target="_blank"&gt;glucose level of the blood&lt;/a&gt; is raised on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 being pure glucose. After all, sometimes you need a little something sweet. Life is short—and a life without the occasional treat would be no fun at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5 natural sweeteners that won’t spike glucose&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;1. Agave syrup (GI 15)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agave syrup is a natural sweetener extracted from the sap of the agave plant, which is the same plant that &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/mezcal-ancient-artisanal-cocktail-tequila" target="_blank"&gt;tequila&lt;/a&gt; is made from. Agave has a fluid texture and a sweet flavor thanks to its fructose concentration, but its glycemic index is three times lower than that of white sugar (GI 15). It can easily be used in drinks, desserts, dressings, and other dishes that require a little sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;2. Honey (GI 55)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though vegans may want to stay away, raw honey is a great sugar substitute. With a moderate glycemic index (GI 55) and distinctive flavor, it’s the perfect compliment to healthy breakfasts and snacks. Most honey—&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/benefits-of-manuka-honey" target="_blank"&gt;especially Manuka&lt;/a&gt;—also contains medicinal properties and can be used for everything from soothing sore throats to healing wounds. Win-win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;3. Coconut sugar (GI 35)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coconut sugar is the natural sweetener obtained from the sap of coconut blossoms. Less refined than white cane sugar, it has a fairly low glycemic index (GI 35), making it a sensible alternative for curbing cravings. It also contains a significant amount of inulin, a &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/prebiotic-foods" target="_blank"&gt;prebiotic fiber&lt;/a&gt; beneficial to digestion. And its unique, sweet, caramelized flavor makes it an indispensable part of the culinary repertoire, especially in pastry-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;4. Monk fruit (GI 0)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monk fruit is 250 times sweeter than cane sugar, yet it contains no calories or carbohydrates. Derived from the fruit of the monk fruit plant, this natural sweetener contains mogrosides that do not raise blood sugar levels—it does not contain any glucose or &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/unhealthy-foods" target="_blank"&gt;fructose&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, the glycemic index of monk fruit sugar is 0, which means it does not raise blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;5. Date syrup (GI 47)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/dates" target="_blank"&gt;Dates&lt;/a&gt; are like nature’s candy, with a sweet, caramel flavor. But despite their confectionary conjurings, the fruit’s glycemic index is around 47, less than half that of conventional sugar. Same goes for date syrup, which contains essential minerals like potassium, magnesium, and iron as well as antioxidants and fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have a beauty or wellness trend you’re curious about?

I had very low self-esteem so I didn't like going out very much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I looked in the mirror and never really felt beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Covid hit and everything shut down and I thought "I've got an opportunity to better myself and I have a lot of time on my hands".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It started with home workouts on YouTube and I started learning lots about nutrition, I watched Joe Wicks and Chloe Ting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Once it started, I fell in love with the process and once you start seeing results it gets easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was 105kg [16st 5lbs], so my health was on the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Previously, Jessica would regularly eat calorie-laden foods including pizza.

And &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65182610/hidden-signs-of-aging/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:turning 40;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;turning 40&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, marks a major milestone: It’s time to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a60659620/new-mammogram-screening-guidelines-2024/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:start getting regular mammograms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;start getting regular mammograms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say 40 is also the perfect time to ask about other life-saving health screenings, as the risk for heart disease, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a30915774/what-causes-high-blood-pressure/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hypertension;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a64900107/myths-about-skin-cancer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:skin cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;skin cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and more increases as you age.

Consider asking your doctor about them at your next annual exam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mammograms&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Starting at age 40, routine mammograms are a must,” says &lt;a href="https://www.jessicashepherdmd.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jessica Shepherd;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jessica Shepherd&lt;/a&gt;, M.D., a board-certified OB/GYN.

Pap smears screen for &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a44798697/cervical-cancer-still-kills-thousands-of-women/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cervical cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and just like any cancer, early detection is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cervical cancer can affect any woman who is or has been sexually active,” Dr. Gaither says. “But it primarily occurs in women who have had HPV, are immune-compromised, have poor nutrition, and don’t get pap smears.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Anchiy - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Eye and Ear Exams&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we age, our vision and hearing often gets worse. That doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll go blind or deaf.

This is especially important if you show risk factors for osteoporosis or frequently fracture your bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Inti St Clair - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Immunizations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Routine immunizations are always important. But since our immune systems can weaken as we age, getting routine vaccinations—like the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a28943934/flu-shot-over-50/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:flu shot;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;flu shot&lt;/a&gt;—is especially essential as you get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;SDI Productions - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Diabetes Screenings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone will benefit from a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a37936855/new-guidance-for-diabetes-testing/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes screening;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diabetes screening&lt;/a&gt;.

And while common symptoms—like hair loss, insomnia, low sex drive, and brain fog—are often caused by the condition, they may also signal something more serious. Checking your hormone levels routinely can give your doctor more insight into what you’re experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;YakobchukOlena - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Complete Lipid Panels&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A complete lipid panel—or a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a63398546/cholesterol-myths-facts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; test—is important in assessing your risk for heart disease, which increases as you age. It’s usually part of a routine annual exam. But if your doctor doesn’t mention it, you can ask to have one done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;MoMo Productions - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Skin Checks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting your &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/g20688920/types-of-skin-cancer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:moles checked;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;moles checked&lt;/a&gt; by a dermatologist is a good idea at any age.

                Frank Frost found camaraderie and better health in a cycling group in the U.K. that his doctor recommended he try.&lt;br&gt;

            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


            &lt;b class="toggle-caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;toggle caption&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;span class="credit" aria-label="Image credit"&gt;
        
        Frank Frost
        
    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;For more than 30 years, Frank Frost worked as a long-distance truck driver, ferrying industrial chemicals across the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I worked away from home six days a week, working up to 12-15 hours a day," says Frost, now 76. "My only exercise was looking for a fast food outlet in the evening when I'd parked up."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He gained weight and was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in his 50s. His doctors put him on insulin injections and told him to lose weight and move more.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When l, like most people, failed, they made me feel weak and worthless," says Frost.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Then, Frost met a doctor with a completely different approach — one that changed his life.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"He asked me what mattered to me, which I'd never been asked before by a doctor," says Frost. "I told him that I wanted to live long enough to see my grandkids grow up." &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The doctor also asked Frost about things he enjoyed doing as a kid and discovered he used to love riding a bike. He gave him a prescription for a 10-week cycling course called &lt;a href="https://pruk.azurewebsites.net/tblnews_list.php?page=list" target="_blank"&gt;Pedal Ready&lt;/a&gt; for adults getting back into cycling.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I hadn't been on a bike for almost 50 years until I started cycling again," says Frost.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;What Frost's doctor had done was give him a social prescription, says journalist Julia Hotz, who's written about Frost's experience in her new book &lt;a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Connection-Cure/Julia-Hotz/9781668030349" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Connection Cure: The Prescriptive Power of Movement, Nature, Art, Service, and Belonging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's the idea of health professionals "literally prescribing you a community activity or resource the same way they'd prescribe you pills or therapies," she explains. The prescriptions include exercise, art, music, exposure to nature and volunteering, which are known to have enormous benefits to physical and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And it all starts with "flipping the script from what's the matter with you to focusing on what matters to you," Hotz says. "What are your activities that you love? What gets you out of bed in the morning?"&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Frost's prescription helped him make friends after years in a solitary profession.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And it helped him lose 100 pounds, get his diabetes under control and go off insulin. He says he still bikes with friends he made through the biking class. They call themselves the "Chain Gang," and members look after each other.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We're all of a certain age," says Frost. " We don't leave anybody. It's changed my life."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Tapping into lifestyle's role in health&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Social prescriptions are not intended to replace pills or therapies, says Hotz, but to complement them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer are now the leading cause of death worldwide. And decades of research has shown that adopting healthy habits can stave them off.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For instance, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/08/23/1193148718/why-a-strangers-hello-can-do-more-than-just-brighten-your-day" target="_blank"&gt;social connection&lt;/a&gt; lifts our mood and benefits health overall — and friends can &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/15/nx-s1-5217975/the-secret-to-doing-hard-things-and-getting-stuff-done" target="_blank"&gt;hold people accountable&lt;/a&gt; when building new, healthy habits. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/08/22/1195337204/a-guide-to-forest-bathing" target="_blank"&gt;Time in nature&lt;/a&gt; can reduce stress, says Hotz. Studies also show that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/05/nx-s1-5247787/depression-walking-step-count-fitness-tracker" target="_blank"&gt;exercise can ease depression and anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/03/12/591513777/hearts-get-younger-even-at-middle-age-with-exercise" target="_blank"&gt;boost cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;. And music and arts are known to be therapeutic for people with mental and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/02/19/1081263873/mental-health-art-therapy" target="_blank"&gt;behavioral disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health care providers in about 30 countries are doing social prescribing to address symptoms of Type 2 diabetes, chronic pain, dementia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and depression,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;among others&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; Hotz says. And a growing number of providers — around 250 so far — in the United States are starting to use them, too, according to &lt;a href="https://www.socialprescribingusa.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Social Prescribing USA&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit organization advocating for this approach.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Social prescribing, really has the promise and the research to back it up to change health care in ways that would be healing for all of us," says&lt;a href="https://www.socialprescribingusa.com/alan-siegel" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Alan Siegel&lt;/a&gt;, a family physician at Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, Calif., and executive director of Social Prescribing USA.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The National Health Service in the U.K. has incorporated social prescribing, covering the cost of hiring caseworkers to connect patients to the right community group. Most prescribers in the U.S. partner with community organizations offering group activities.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But in some instances, health insurers help cover related costs. For example, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield has &lt;a href="https://www.newjerseystage.com/articles/2021/07/13/horizon-blue-cross-blue-shield-of-nj-supports-njpacs-capital-campaign-new-arts-and-wellness-initiative-with-3m-grant/" target="_blank"&gt;partnered with the New Jersey Performing Arts Center&lt;/a&gt; to connect high utilizers of the health system to arts and culture programs in the community.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Health and cost benefits&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Studies in the U.K., which routinely uses social prescribing, show that not only does it improve health, it also saves money.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's a reduction in emergency room visits, in repeat visits to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9615419/" target="_blank"&gt;primary care providers&lt;/a&gt;, and that over time generates a pretty significant return on investment," Hotz says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health care systems are increasingly recognizing that "it's cheaper for them to cover 10 weeks of Zumba classes than it is to cover, for example, high blood pressure medication over the course of a lifetime, or GLP agonists over the course of a lifetime," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A report on &lt;a href="https://irp.cdn-website.com/92bb31b3/files/uploaded/A_Healthier_Canada-An_Analysis_of_the_Potential_Economic_and_Social_Impacts_of_Social_Prescribing.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;social prescribing in Canada&lt;/a&gt; found that for older adults, there was nearly $300 million cost saving from lower hospitalizations, emergency calls and visits to the ER due to fewer falls. Among youth, they found a 14% increase in lifetime earnings for youth ages 15-17 struggling with anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.artpharmacy.co/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22390708514&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAApn8V2F4tL_I-kz3vaQ3CQTVyGSNk&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw1JjDBhDjARIsABlM2SvC6D9qY0-5fGRyJxO6xWkZY81NBUDa56nx8Y1tSZsP7pg4INj6YpkaApGvEALw_wcB" target="_blank"&gt;Art Pharmacy&lt;/a&gt;, a Georgia-based program that collaborates with health systems, insurers and universities to connect patients with cultural activities, reports that more than two-thirds of people participating saw improved mental health, and a reduction in ER visits.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Doctors at &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/departments/community-care/depts/geriatric" target="_blank"&gt;the Center for Geriatric Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; have found social prescribing especially valuable for seniors, says &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/22798-ardeshir-hashmi" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Ardeshir Hashmi&lt;/a&gt;, chief of geriatrics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They now regularly ask patients questions like: "What was your career in? Who else is at home? Do you have friends? Do you have family? What do you enjoy doing and are you still doing those things?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hashmi has had patients who want to be more connected to nature, or want to resume being a member of a book club, or engage in creating art, or in volunteering.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;His patients have seen "significant improvement" in levels of loneliness, he says, as well as in symptoms of depression, anxiety and memory problems.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;What lights you up? Find a prescription for yourself&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Anyone interested in social prescribing can &lt;a href="https://www.socialprescribingusa.com/initiative-tracker" target="_blank"&gt;check out a map&lt;/a&gt; on Social Prescribing USA's website for a list of organizations and health systems that are doing this in some capacity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The kinds of programs listed include &lt;a href="https://walkwithadoc.org/who-we-are/our-mission/" target="_blank"&gt;Walk with a Doc&lt;/a&gt;, an organization hosting walks with doctors in communities in 54 states and territories. It's aimed at helping people embrace walking together for health. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And if you're not seeing something in your area, try asking your doctor for help, even if they aren't familiar with social prescribing, suggests Hashmi.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He suggests asking your doctor questions like, "Is there a community you can connect me with? This is what matters most to me in my life. I've lost that at some point over time. Are there other patients that you know of that you could connect me with? Is there a community organization that you know of?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And if your doctor is unable to help you, Hotz suggests turning to the internet to look for community organizations already doing what you are seeking, whether it's hiking, drawing, singing, swimming, volunteering with kids, or spending time with friends.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's a ton of options to choose from, a lot of options at local libraries, local parks departments, a ton of groups trying to make social prescriptions free or low cost to people," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The key, Hotz says, is asking yourself the right questions before you start looking for a community organization to join. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, "What lights you up in the morning? If you had two more hours in the week, what would you spend it doing? What was an activity you loved to do as a kid but haven't had a chance to do since?" she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

But for people with diabetes, who must watch their carbohydrate and sugar intake closely, the natural sugar content in mango raises important questions: Is it safe to eat? Can it be part of a balanced diet? And what does the research say?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="26638092" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="can-diabetics-eat-mango" source="keywords"&gt;Can diabetics eat mango&lt;/keyword&gt;? Here's why this sweet fruit can be a smart choice&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mango often gets a bad rap for being too sweet—but in reality, it can be a healthy, diabetes-friendly fruit when enjoyed in moderation. Despite its natural sugar content, mango is rich in nutrients, fibre, and antioxidants that support overall health and may help manage blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Diabetes Management Made Simple: 5 Yoga Asanas That Work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One cup of sliced mango (about 165 grams) provides 99 calories, 25 grams of carbohydrates, and 22.5 grams of natural sugar, along with 2.6 grams of dietary fibre. It also delivers 67% of your daily vitamin C, 18% folate, 20% copper, and 10% each of vitamins A and E, plus 6% potassium. These nutrients boost immunity, support metabolism, and contribute to overall wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly for people with diabetes, mango has a low glycemic index (GI) of around 51, which means it raises blood sugar more slowly than high-GI foods. The fibre content helps slow digestion and sugar absorption, reducing the risk of sudden glucose spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While over 90% of mango’s calories come from sugar, its nutritional profile makes it a better option than many processed or high-starch snacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to its balance of natural sugars, fibre, and micronutrients, mango can be a smart carb choice in a diabetes-friendly diet—as long as portion sizes are controlled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Studies supports moderate mango consumption&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2014 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4155986/#:~:text=However%2C%20there%20were%20no%20significant,effect%20on%20fasting%20blood%20glucose." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published in the journal Nutrition and Metabolic Insights found that overweight individuals who consumed 10 grams of freeze-dried mango daily experienced improvements in blood sugar control. Another &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mango.org/Mangos/media/Media/Documents/Research%20And%20Resources/Research/Industry/Nutrition/Obesity_Pilot_Study_Full_Report_ENG.pdf?ext=.pdf&amp;amp;" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; by the Oklahoma State University’s Department of Nutritional Sciences concluded that mango polyphenols may help reduce adiposity and improve glucose tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/3/490?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published in Food &amp;amp; Function found that mango consumption was associated with improved insulin sensitivity and reduced inflammation markers in adults. These effects were observed when mango was eaten in moderation and not paired with high-starch or high-fat foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to make mango more diabetes-friendly&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have diabetes, you don’t necessarily need to avoid mango altogether—but how much you eat and what you eat it with can make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start by focusing on portion size. One standard carbohydrate serving equals about 15 grams of carbs. A half-cup of sliced mango (around 82.5 grams) contains roughly 12.5 grams of carbs, making it a safe starting portion for most people with diabetes. Eating more than this in one sitting could raise your blood sugar more than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make mango even easier on your blood sugar, pair it with a source of protein or healthy fat. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add mango slices to Greek yoghurt or cottage cheese&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enjoy it with a boiled egg or a handful of nuts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blend it into a smoothie with protein powder and chia seeds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These combinations slow digestion, which helps reduce blood sugar spikes and keeps energy levels more stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to avoid mango in processed forms. Mango juice, dried mango, and sweetened mango products often contain added sugars and minimal fibre, making them much more likely to spike blood sugar levels quickly. Stick to fresh mango in controlled portions for the healthiest option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When and how to eat mango if you have diabetes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timing matters when it comes to fruit and blood sugar. Many doctors and dietitians suggest eating fruit like mango earlier in the day, when your insulin sensitivity is naturally higher. This means your body is better able to handle carbohydrates and convert them into energy without spiking blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another simple trick is to cut mango into small cubes. This helps you slow down while eating and makes it easier to enjoy the sweet flavour in smaller, more satisfying portions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also helpful to understand how mango sugar is processed in the body. About 30% of the sugar in mango is fructose, which is metabolised by the liver. While moderate amounts are fine for most people, excess fructose can increase triglyceride levels—a type of fat in the blood linked to heart disease. This is especially important for people who have both diabetes and high cholesterol. In short, mango can be a healthy, diabetes-friendly treat when eaten mindfully—with attention to timing, portion size, and smart food pairings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mango is not off-limits for people with diabetes. It has a low glycemic index, is rich in fibre, and contains valuable antioxidants and vitamins. The key is moderation: start with small portions, monitor your blood sugar response, and pair mango with protein or healthy fats to reduce its glycaemic impact. Always consult a healthcare provider or dietitian before making dietary changes, especially if you have blood sugar issues. With the right approach, mango can be a delicious and health-supportive addition to a diabetes-friendly diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="strong" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Also Read:  This blood test can predict heart attack risk, and it’s not cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 08:44:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwJBVV95cUxQRHZGMFlmV01BN0FNbWZnYXRZM3dJdFFOOElybkNldUtDb0RITXFWS0ZOaW8wUGJjaUxUTzNiUGVCZm92MkNyQ3d4MjlueDY5VW1uTmh0djFfeEh4YU5yTmNkdVZ0VjR4bV92ZGhiVHNWQUtCY0ZDck9aYzVmTGdqSnlEcy1Gd1JQdXBQSFNKQ05fYTJodmhhUzhjcVlOTzdKTEZzQ1pCb2pBSFFCbmtHaVVZRkJFVDZSaVpYTTlPdXpsdFdtTzk3NHJkOTktVWZ3Y1ZwUzFkUGZwSWU5TTRwckRxa2g1dFBTRm01c0YwanFNRW9POGZEempGdElkSHRDTzMyUENzYw</guid></item><item><title>世卫组织推荐使用注射用来那卡帕韦预防艾滋病毒-世界卫生组织（世卫组织） | WHO recommends injectable lenacapavir for HIV prevention - World Health Organization (WHO)</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxONkR6TDNqc0I5UjVrTnUtUTByODBpN2tWdWctWDFWTVROV1Q5Qmx5cUZmcHFGWGljNElnZkNPLUZCSDJ3U2E0N0R6a0ljZFNhbEJkS25LLW5OR0tJV2tZZjR5aGU5bTRsN2hOcF9uU0JUY1VzWEVVZlhoOGZUdVVCRjF6clNoWXd2SDM0em94YVhBQ0RYeFBxcERDeDh0UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) released today &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/9789240111608"&gt;new guidelines recommending the use of injectable lenacapavir (LEN)&lt;/a&gt; twice a year as an additional pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) option for HIV prevention, in a landmark policy action that could help reshape the global HIV response. The guidelines are being issued at the 13th International AIDS Society Conference (IAS 2025) on HIV Science, in Kigali, Rwanda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LEN, the first twice-yearly injectable PrEP product, offers a highly effective, long-acting alternative to daily oral pills and other shorter-acting options. With just two doses per year, LEN is a transformative step forward in protecting people at risk of HIV – particularly those who face challenges with daily adherence, stigma, or access to health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While an HIV vaccine remains elusive, lenacapavir is the next best thing: a long-acting antiretroviral shown in trials to prevent almost all HIV infections among those at risk," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “The launch of WHO’s new guidelines, alongside the FDA’s recent approval, marks a critical step forward in expanding access to this powerful tool. WHO is committed to working with countries and partners to ensure this innovation reaches communities as quickly and safely as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines come at a critical moment as HIV prevention efforts stagnate with 1.3 million new HIV infections occurring in 2024 – with disproportionate impact among key and priority populations, including sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgender people, people who inject drugs, people in prisons, and children and adolescents. WHO’s recommendation on LEN signals a decisive move to expand and diversify HIV prevention, giving people more options to take control over their health with choices that fit their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Simplified testing: a major barrier removed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of these guidelines, WHO has recommended a public health approach to HIV testing using HIV rapid tests to support delivery of long-acting injectable PrEP, including LEN and cabotegravir (CAB-LA). The simplified testing recommendation removes a major access barrier by eliminating complex, costly procedures and enabling community-based delivery of long-acting PrEP through pharmacies, clinics, and tele-health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Next steps: call for implementation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;LEN joins other WHO-recommended PrEP options, including daily oral PrEP, injectable cabotegravir and the dapivirine vaginal ring, as part of a growing arsenal of tools to end the HIV epidemic. While access to LEN outside clinical trials remains limited at the moment, WHO urges governments, donors and global health partners to begin rolling out LEN immediately within national combination HIV prevention programmes – while collecting essential data on uptake, adherence and real-world impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additional WHO recommendations at IAS 2025&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, WHO’s &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/B09471-eng"&gt;treatment guidelines&lt;/a&gt; include a clear recommendation for the use of long-acting injectable cabotegravir and rilpivirine (CAB/RPV) as an alternative switching option for antiretroviral therapy (ART) for adults and adolescents who have achieved full viral suppression on oral ART and do not have active hepatitis B infection. This approach is designed to support people living with HIV facing adherence challenges to oral regimens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Updated guidelines on service delivery integration include recommendations to integrate HIV services with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as hypertension and diabetes, as well as mental health care for depression, anxiety and alcohol use disorders into HIV services, alongside interventions to support ART adherence. Additionally, new guidelines on &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/9789240104907"&gt;management of asymptomatic STIs recommend screening of gonorrhoea and/or chlamydia in key and priority populations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people living with HIV who have &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/B09434"&gt;mpox&lt;/a&gt; and are either ART naive or have experienced prolonged ART interruption, rapid initiation of ART is strongly recommended. Additionally, early HIV testing is advised for individuals presenting with suspected or confirmed mpox infection. &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/B09434"&gt;WHO’s standard operating procedures&lt;/a&gt; further emphasize HIV and syphilis testing for all individuals with suspected or confirmed mpox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the broader challenges facing HIV programmes, WHO has also issued new &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/9789240112759"&gt;operational guidance&lt;/a&gt; on sustaining priority HIV services in a changing funding landscape. The guidance aims to provide a stepwise framework to help countries prioritize services, assess risks, monitor disruptions, and adapt systems to protect health outcomes and preserve progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have the tools and the knowledge to end AIDS as a public health problem,” said Dr Meg Doherty, Director of WHO’s Department of Global HIV, Hepatitis and STI Programmes and incoming Director of Science, Research, Evidence and Quality for Health. “What we need now is bold implementation of these recommendations, grounded in equity and powered by communities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIV remains a major global public health issue. By the end of 2024, an estimated 40.8 million people were living with HIV with an estimated 65% in the WHO African Region. Approximately 630 000 people died from HIV-related causes globally, and an estimated 1.3 million people acquired HIV, including 120 000 children. Access to ART continues to expand, with 31.6 million people receiving treatment in 2024, up from 30.3 million in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a time of reduced funding for HIV and health, WHO’s new and updated guidelines offer practical, evidence-based strategies to sustain momentum. By expanding prevention and treatment options, simplifying service delivery and promoting integration with broader health services, they support more efficient, equitable, and resilient HIV responses. Now is the moment for bold implementation to ensure these gains translate into real-world impact.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Note to the editor&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO at the 13th IAS Conference on HIV Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IAS 2025, the&lt;a href="https://www.iasociety.org/conferences/ias2025" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;13th IAS Conference on HIV Science&lt;/a&gt; is being held in Kigali from 13 to 17 July 2025. It is the world’s most influential meeting on HIV research and its applications. This biennial conference presents the critical advances in basic, clinical and operational HIV research that move science into policy and practice. Through its programme, the meeting sets the gold standard of HIV science, featuring highly diverse and cutting-edge research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At IAS 2025, WHO will present new normative guidance through key satellite sessions and engage at the highest level to highlight innovations and promote health equity, while sounding the alarm on the risks posed by declining global health funding.

Kennedy Jr. spent much of his confirmation process before becoming the nation’s health secretary reassuring lawmakers that he would not undermine public confidence in vaccines and &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/30/rfk-jr-confirmation-hearing-day-2-health-secretary-nominee/"&gt;seeking to distance himself&lt;/a&gt; from the anti-vaccine group he founded, Children’s Health Defense.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As health secretary, he has installed former prominent members of that group and other vaccine skeptics in positions at the department he runs or agencies it oversees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The appointment of officials from CHD, including a former president of the group, points to the growing influence of anti-vaccine advocates at federal health agencies since Kennedy took over in February. To former officials at the Department of Health and Human Services as well as public health experts, the hires are the latest signs that &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/16/robert-kennedy-moderate-for-hhs-confirmation-returns-to-anti-vaccine-roots/"&gt;Kennedy is embracing vaccine skepticism&lt;/a&gt; and undermining the public health apparatus that reviews, approves, and recommends vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

            The World Health Organization is now recommending that countries include an HIV drug newly approved for prevention, lenacapavir, as a tool in their efforts to fight HIV infections – especially for groups most at risk and in areas where the burden of HIV remains high.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d00013b6n6xdo5c18@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://programme.ias2025.org/Programme/Session/202" target="_blank"&gt;global recommendation&lt;/a&gt; – issued Monday at the International AIDS Conference in Kigali, Rwanda – comes about a month after the US Food and Drug Administration approved lenacapavir as a twice-yearly injection for the prevention of the human immunodeficiency virus or HIV. Lenacapavir had been approved in 2022 to treat certain HIV infections and, in trials for prevention, it&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;was found to dramatically reduce the risk of infection and provide almost total protection against HIV.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d00033b6nc6niv3x3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These new recommendations are designed for real-world use. WHO is working closely with countries and partners to support the implementation,” Dr. Meg Doherty, director of WHO’s Department of Global HIV, Hepatitis and Sexually Transmitted Infections Programmes, said in a news briefing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d00043b6n9h2bxakw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The first recommendation is that a long-acting injectable, lenacapavir, should be offered as an additional prevention choice for people at risk for HIV and as part of combination prevention. With that, we call it a strong recommendation with moderate to high certainty of the evidence,” Doherty said. The second recommendation in the guidelines is that rapid diagnostic tests like at-home tests can be used to screen someone for HIV when they are starting, continuing or stopping long-acting medication to prevent infection – called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d00053b6nmrqu0gnt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HIV spreads primarily through unprotected sex or sharing needles. It attacks the body’s immune system, and without treatment, it can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS. Globally, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/hiv-aids" target="_blank"&gt;about 40 million people were living with HIV&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2023, according to WHO.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d00063b6ngrqsd2xz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            PrEP has been used to prevent HIV infections for years. In the United States, this may involve taking pills, such as a daily medication called Truvada, or getting injections, such as every two months of the medication Apretude.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d00073b6n19o4g4ut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But twice-yearly injections of lenacapavir, or LEN, have become another option in the prevention toolbox – not just for the United States but for the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d00083b6n4qm4m7f6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “LEN is a six-monthly injectable option, and it may be particularly attractive for people who prefer fewer clinic visits or have challenges with daily oral PrEP. … It could improve adherence and reach more people who need HIV prevention and can be used in pregnant and breastfeeding women,” Doherty said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d00093b6nywpmrx3e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “WHO is providing technical assistance to countries interested in adopting LEN and simplified testing strategies, in coordination with global partners like the Global Fund, UNAIDS and several other partners and donors,” she said. “We call on governments, funders, implementers and civil society to work together for implementing and integrating LEN into the HIV programs. And we believe time to act is now.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000b3b6nhk43rz6a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There has been growing concern around funding for global HIV prevention efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            International assistance accounts for 80% of prevention programs in low- and middle-income countries, according to the United Nations. But in the past six months, the United States has significantly withdrawn funding for much of its foreign assistance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The Trump administration has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/30/politics/bush-obama-trump-usaid"&gt;dismantled the US Agency for International Development&lt;/a&gt;, or USAID, and reduced funding for the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/about-us-pepfar" target="_blank"&gt;PEPFAR&lt;/a&gt;, which acts as the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease in history.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Gilead Sciences, maker of lenacapavir, announced Wednesday that it has reached an agreement with the nonprofit Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to supply lenacapavir for HIV prevention at no profit to the company. Under this agreement, Gilead’s pricing reflects only the cost of producing and delivering lenacapavir.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000f3b6n7mn6vimf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are providing the medicine at no profit to Gilead, and in enough supply to reach up to two million people in low- and lower-middle-income countries ahead of generic lenacapavir becoming available,” Gilead Chairman and CEO Daniel O’Day &lt;a href="https://www.gilead.com/news/news-details/2025/gilead-finalizes-agreement-with-the-global-fund-to-accelerate-access-to-twice-yearly-lenacapavir-for-hiv-prevention-for-up-to-two-million-people-in-primarily-low--and-lower-middle-income-countries" target="_blank"&gt;said in a news release&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000g3b6n7uctffwp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The company added that the cost of lenacapavir under this agreement remains confidential.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000h3b6nlwm1wypb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the United States, the only place where lenacapavir has received approval for HIV prevention&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;so far, the drug has an annual list price of $28,218 when used for HIV prevention. The cost is similar to the price of other prevention medicine options, according to Gilead.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000i3b6nt16k9mgc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lenacapavir can “fundamentally change the trajectory of the HIV epidemic,” but only if it reaches the people who need it most, Peter Sands, executive director of the Global Fund, said in the news release.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000j3b6nfhoe3oo6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our ambition is to reach 2 million people with long-acting PrEP. But we can only do that if the world steps up with the resources required,” he said. “This is a pivotal moment — not just for the fight against HIV, but for the fundamental principle that lifesaving innovations must reach those who need them most — whoever they are, and wherever they live.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000l3b6nzj2h4j4i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/UNAIDS-global-AIDS-update-2025" target="_blank"&gt;United Nations warned in a report&lt;/a&gt; released Thursday that millions more people could die from HIV-related causes by 2029 if funding for HIV programs permanently disappears.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000m3b6n7x0a95fr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among the 60 low- and middle-income countries included in the report, 25 have indicated increasing their domestic budgets for HIV response efforts next year. But the report noted that may not be sufficient to replace the scale of international funding that these countries have been heavily reliant on.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000n3b6np0qd0tbe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We know that PEPFAR had committed $4.3 billion to over 50 countries &lt;a href="https://2021-2025.state.gov/pepfar-world-aids-day-2023/update-on-pepfars-programming-budget-for-2024-2025/" target="_blank"&gt;in 2025&lt;/a&gt;, and that support was suddenly ended in January of 2025,” Mary Mahy, director of &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/aboutunaids/unaidsleadership/bios/mary-mahy" target="_blank"&gt;UNAIDS’s Data for Impact&lt;/a&gt; department, said in a news briefing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000o3b6n698i8lji@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If none of the PEPFAR funding is replaced, we’d expect something like 4 million additional deaths between 2025 and 2029, and another 6 million additional new infections,” she said. “We also know that drug resistance would likely occur with some of those people going off treatment.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000q3b6nm8y8s3lx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some countries already have seen effects of the rollback of funding for HIV programs, according to Mahy. In Nigeria, facilities reported that there were about 40,000 people who received PrEP at least once during the later part of last year. That number dropped to fewer than 7,000 in April, &lt;a href="https://aidsinfo.unaids.org/services" target="_blank"&gt;according to UNAIDS data&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000r3b6nwqah161l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A similar trend emerged in Kenya, where there has been a decline in the number of women living with HIV who recently gave birth&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and received medications to reduce their risk of transmitting the virus to their newborns. About 3,000 women already received medications and nearly 900 initiated medications in October 2024, but those numbers fell to only about 300 already receiving and 100 starting medications in April.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000s3b6necbfw9yb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is not just a funding gap — it’s a ticking time bomb. … We have seen services vanish overnight. Health workers have been sent home. And people — especially children and key populations — are being pushed out of care,” UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/pressreleaseandstatementarchive/2025/july/20250710_global-aids-update?c" target="_blank"&gt;said in a news release Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “There is still time to transform this crisis into an opportunity,” Byanyima said. “Countries are stepping up with domestic funding. Communities are showing what works. We now need global solidarity to match their courage and resilience,”
    &lt;/p&gt;

The study analysed people born between 2008 and 2017 and estimated that 15.6 million individuals globally from this generation are at risk of developing gastric cancer in their lifetime. Worryingly, almost two-thirds of these cases will occur in Asia, largely due to high population numbers and ongoing exposure to risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;India and China could see 6.5 million gastric cancer cases combined&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study highlights that India and China together could account for approximately 6.5 million new gastric cancer cases in the coming decades. This projection positions Asia as the global hotspot for the disease. The rise is largely driven by factors such as rapid population growth, increasing life expectancy, and a continued prevalence of key risk factors—many of which are still not adequately addressed through public health measures. These include poor sanitation, limited access to healthcare, and dietary habits that may increase stomach cancer risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say this could make gastric cancer one of India’s biggest future health crises if timely action is not taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="24374347" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="Helicobacter-pylori-infection" source="keywords"&gt;Helicobacter pylori infection&lt;/keyword&gt; causes most gastric cancer cases in India&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most important takeaways from the study is that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the leading cause of future gastric cancer cases—accounting for about 76% of them. This bacterium infects the lining of the stomach and can remain undetected for years. Over time, it causes inflammation that can lead to ulcers and eventually cancer. In India, where access to preventive screening is limited and awareness is low, H. pylori often goes untreated, significantly raising the risk of long-term health complications. The study urges stronger surveillance and early intervention programmes to tackle this hidden epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gastric cancer is rising in India faster than in many regions&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, gastric cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, but its burden is not evenly distributed. While some regions, like Sub-Saharan Africa, report relatively low incidence rates today, the study warns of a six-fold increase in cases in those areas over time. In contrast, India’s numbers are expected to rise more sharply and sooner due to existing health inequalities, limited diagnostic infrastructure, and lack of widespread awareness about early symptoms. This puts millions of Indians at a heightened and preventable risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Early detection could prevent most gastric cancer cases&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research points to a clear solution: early screening and treatment of H. pylori can dramatically reduce future cases of gastric cancer—by as much as 75%. In countries like India, where healthcare resources may be stretched, focusing on population-wide, low-cost screening initiatives could be a game-changer. Treating H. pylori with antibiotics and simple follow-up care could save countless lives and significantly ease the burden on the healthcare system. These preventive steps are not only scientifically sound but also financially viable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Younger populations in India face rising gastric cancer risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most alarming finding from the study is that gastric cancer is increasingly affecting younger individuals, especially those born after 2008. This is a major shift from previous decades when the disease primarily affected older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined with India’s ageing population, this trend could create a dual burden of both young and elderly patients requiring long-term cancer care. Without timely intervention, India risks reversing years of public health progress in cancer control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;India must take public health action against gastric cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce its future gastric cancer burden, India needs to adopt a multi-pronged public health strategy. The study recommends:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nationwide screening campaigns to detect and treat H. pylori early&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Public education initiatives to raise awareness of gastric cancer symptoms, such as persistent indigestion, bloating, and unexplained weight loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strengthening diagnostic infrastructure, especially in rural areas where healthcare access is limited&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Promoting healthy dietary and lifestyle habits, such as reducing salt-preserved foods, stopping tobacco use, and increasing intake of fruits and vegetables&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These actions are essential not only to control gastric cancer rates but also to build long-term resilience in India’s public health system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With projections estimating over 1.6 million new gastric cancer cases in India alone, the country is at a crossroads. The study’s findings are a powerful reminder that prevention is not just possible—it is necessary. Investing in screening, early detection, and health education can prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths and reduce the financial and emotional toll on families. If India acts now, it can turn the tide and prevent gastric cancer from becoming an unstoppable epidemic in the decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/the-first-60-minutes-after-a-heart-attack-make-all-the-difference-why-the-golden-hour-is-crucial/articleshow/122380076.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;The first 60 minutes after a heart attack make all the difference: Why the ‘Golden Hour’ is crucial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 05:41:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAJBVV95cUxQYTc1VVhGTndFdE53MlR5a2EtcEZSbnNVU0FQZXpMYnVoLVNhWUhJcHUyLW5mUTM1el90YmtLR3RydzNhWU9jWW9mdVhYaC03b3g5RTJneUxQQXVIVzBraVV1Z080elBoTnFEckMtcTd5bVJ3cWt4QTd1MVVTcVh2YURiQ3R5M1picTBoaTZ4Z3AtS3l3YmRFeTl3VmZqNHcyNDZMOGZKb2VGeTV5REJWeDlOdnNBelEzMXVUUXFVclhpRmxpbGFldGlUUVRybkg2TkU1bzZsRWNPR1E1UHpZUVI5ZkN5WXg5a3dpT2o1WTBMLVppYnk2LV9tZzU4RS1JU0tueGZ0TGFuZ0hV0gGSAkFVX3lxTE5vb2hZT0ZHRkhheWh4UU1FcEpQWHZMYXFMZzVIZlR2cHVNUHV2N2dIaXZZWjVmNV91V2I2WVppSWRmV0RDdWNsazBuWmtQRk1oVDFWVmxnMHM0VlAyeGN0LW5KWFJnYzFzN2s4Zm1aaVpYS2pfY3R4N0NBcjZXc0xTQ0t4NDZGZi1sLUtweWtDYndqeHJmVjN4YTNEREJHU2haNThTbHNoR05hZUNScW1TQ0JpbC1GclhkWEhPNV9fYm1IWW42bExMZkM2Qm9ZMEJJa3h3TXhURTRpT2VSZGpMcWQtdXg1RXl5U2NMd1htSTNwWHNTY0MtM0phX3RLYUZ5MnZtTzF6OTJELUxQRWlzZkE</guid></item><item><title>GoodSAM警报应用程序由英国广播公司（ BBC ）推出，由South Central Ambulance Service | GoodSAM alert app introduced by South Central Ambulance Service -

known as GoodSAM - which uses mobile GPS technology to message volunteers within 500m of an incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It is hoped the responders could then begin CPR before an ambulance arrives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;David Harmer, operations manager of SCAS, said it could "dramatically increase the chances of a positive outcome" for cardiac arrest patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The early delivery of CPR and defibrillation is critical in improving survival rates from cardiac arrest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Every minute without intervention reduces the chance of survival by up to 10%, SCAS said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The first phase of GoodSAM has been introduced in the SCAS area - Hampshire, Berkshire and Oxfordshire -  as well as Isle of Wight Ambulance Service area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Certified healthcare professionals and clinically trained individuals are able to register.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The aim is to then open it up to trained public volunteers from the autumn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The registration process includes verification of credentials and training to ensure all responders meet the required standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;David Hamer, operations manager for SCAS, said: "By enabling trained responders to reach patients faster, we can dramatically increase the chances of a positive outcome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"This is about saving lives, and we are proud to be part of this initiative."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This project has been partly funded by South Central Ambulance Charity, which supports SCAS in enhancing emergency care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 05:13:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1YN3RLcXJSNU9oYVdyMlRBZXZYN1pmZXRYcnQwTHhvcGVIRGF2Sy1ZbmVzS0Z4Z2syb1dJdGFxZDNfWjlkN2hMd3pIYl9wUWR6LTMyd2MzNnk4d9IBX0FVX3lxTFAxZ0FGZGRlWUMxcFlZclpSd3VxaEVsOGsxYTZJckhIc01VSmhBUHBfaUFSd01JZkptSVFobi15VGFIY0Q3TDhmcE1WczZaYnMwUkxjZVhjWVA2eU4tTWFj</guid></item><item><title>什么是“fibremaxxing” ，我们都应该这样做吗？ -
