              &lt;p&gt;Bill Nye, the science educator who’s been a TV mainstay for decades, is not the kind of guy you’d expect would be friends with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the most prominent anti-science kook in the country. But apparently they go way back. And Nye is getting sick of all the texts he’s getting from Kennedy spouting absolute garbage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nye met Kennedy “many years ago,” according to a new profile of The Science Guy in &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a64929773/bill-nye-interview/"&gt;Men’s Health&lt;/a&gt; magazine, after the two men were introduced by actor Ed Begley Jr. to talk about environmental issues. Nye told the magazine that Kennedy, who’s now the head of the Department of Health and Human Services, sends him endless texts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Just no self-awareness,” Nye said of Kennedy. “And if you read these articles he sent, they’re all this speculation about autism and just cause-and-effect, and mercury in vaccines, that &lt;em data-node-id="10.1"&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; there’s a connection.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Kennedy has long been an anti-vaccine extremist, working from 2015-2023 as chair of the Children’s Health Defense. The health secretary has previously said “there’s no vaccine that is safe and effective” and has worked to limit access to vaccines, risking the lives of millions of Americans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nye told Men’s Health that he responded to the texts by saying he’d read Kennedy’s book, though it’s not clear which one. Kennedy has contributed to quite a few anti-science screeds, including books like &lt;em&gt;Vax-Unvax: Let the Science Speak&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Wuhan Cover-Up&lt;/em&gt;, and 2021’s &lt;em&gt;The Real Anthony Fauci&lt;/em&gt;. That last one includes a section where Kennedy promotes “miasma theory” and rejects germ theory. Miasma theory was abandoned in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miasma_theory"&gt;19th century&lt;/a&gt;, while the germ theory of disease is foundational to our 21st-century understanding of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease"&gt;how diseases spread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nye told the magazine that after he got “miles and miles” of texts from Kennedy, he finally said, “Okay, no more texts,” concluding Kennedy simply wasn’t suited for the job he’s holding in the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Kennedy is a dangerous lunatic who doesn’t even believe in germ theory. But he’s going to do a lot of damage before he leaves his job. And it’s already happening. Kennedy’s so-called Make America Healthy Again commission issued a report last month that was riddled with errors and cited studies that &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-make-america-healthy-again-report-cites-fake-studies-2000608850"&gt;don’t exist&lt;/a&gt;. And earlier this week, Kennedy fired all &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-purges-cdcs-vital-vaccine-advisory-committee-2000613732"&gt;17 members&lt;/a&gt; of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Those are the folks who help steer the country’s vaccine policies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The FDA under Kennedy is also reportedly using AI to help &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/after-slashing-thousands-of-jobs-trumps-fda-wants-to-use-ai-to-approve-new-drugs-more-quickly-2000614144"&gt;approve new drugs&lt;/a&gt;, something that boggles the mind when you remember just how unreliable AI can be. Kennedy has repeatedly touted “&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-touts-spirituality-as-fix-for-americas-health-problems-2000565002"&gt;spirituality&lt;/a&gt;” as a fix to America’s health crisis, something Trump’s new pick to be Surgeon General has emphasized &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/maga-crackpots-turn-on-trumps-crackpot-surgeon-general-nominee-2000599701"&gt;as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Kennedy has long claimed that vaccines cause autism, and promised during a White House event &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/secretary-brain-worm-rfk-jr-tells-trump-well-know-the-cause-of-autism-by-fall-2000587763"&gt;back in April&lt;/a&gt; that he would reveal the “cause” of autism by the fall. Science doesn’t work with that kind of certainty or timetable, announcing the cause of a given disease like you’re unveiling a new Star Wars show before the holidays. But we’re not dealing with serious people, as Trump has taken charge, booting scientific experts in favor of the weirdest people on the planet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Science Guy may try to be diplomatic when it comes to his old friend, “Bobby” Kennedy, as he calls him in the new Men’s Health article. But when even your friends are saying you don’t have “good judgment” in national magazines, something is way off.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

It's the first time a regulator &lt;a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/prac-concludes-eye-condition-naion-very-rare-side-effect-semaglutide-medicines-ozempic-rybelsus-wegovy" target="_blank"&gt;has confirmed the side effect&lt;/a&gt; following previous &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/17/healthy-returns-ozempic-faces-scrutiny-over-potential-eye-condition-risk.html"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; in Type 2 diabetes patients linking Ozempic to the condition, known as non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee has asked Novo Nordisk to add the eye condition as a side effect of "very rare" frequency in the product information for drugs that contain semaglutide. That's the active ingredient in Wegovy, Ozempic and Novo Nordisk's diabetes pill Rybelsus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's the latest potential concern about popular GLP-1s such as Ozempic and Wegovy, which mimic gut hormones to regulate blood sugar and tamp down appetite. Demand for the drug class has soared despite hefty price tags and a handful of unpleasant side effects that are most commonly gastrointestinal, such as nausea and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It likely won't be a big concern for the vast majority of patients: the eye condition may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people taking semaglutide for at least one year, according to the committee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee said people with diabetes who are exposed to semaglutide are at a twofold increase in the risk of developing NAION compared with those not taking it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eye condition is the second-most common cause of blindness due to optic nerve damage, after glaucoma. It is characterized by vision loss due to decreased blood flow to the front part of the optic nerve, which connects the eye to the brain. The disease typically occurs without any pain and most commonly affects people ages 50 and above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee said patients should stop treatment with semaglutide products if they experience the side effect. Since December, it has been reviewing &lt;a href="https://laegemiddelstyrelsen.dk/en/news/2024/suspicion-of-rare-eye-condition-from-ozempic-use-to-be-investigated-further/" target="_blank"&gt;the findings&lt;/a&gt; of two Danish &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.09.24318574v1.full.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; linking Ozempic to the condition in diabetes patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Novo Nordisk said it has concluded that the data "did not suggest a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between semaglutide and NAION." The company said the benefits of semaglutide still outweigh its risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the drugmaker said it will collaborate with the EMA to update the labels for semaglutide products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A day before the committee's statement, GLP-1s faced scrutiny over another potential eye-related side effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2834964?guestAccessKey=6090e38f-93ad-448f-aaff-ef4768286c5d&amp;amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;amp;utm_term=060525" target="_blank"&gt;published &lt;/a&gt;Thursday in JAMA Ophthalmology and conducted by University of Toronto researchers, found that diabetes patients who use GLP-1 drugs were twice as likely to develop neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) compared to those who don't take the medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that the longer patients were treated with these medications, the greater their risk of developing nAMD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;nAMD, commonly known as "wet" AMD, is the less common but more aggressive form of age-related macular degeneration. It is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss among older adults in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers drew on health records from Ontario, Canada. They analyzed nearly 140,000 adults with Type 2 diabetes to investigate a possible link between GLP-1 use and wet AMD. In the vast majority of cases, patients received semaglutide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk said semaglutide's "efficacy and safety have been extensively demonstrated in people with obesity/overweight with robust evidence for improving health outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at &lt;a href="http://nbcuni.com/?__source=newsletter%7Chealthyreturns" target="_blank"&gt;annikakim.constantino@nbcuni.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Latest in health-care tech: Here are the health tech companies that made CNBC's Disruptor 50 List&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/2025-cnbc-disruptor-50-see-the-full-list-of-companies.html"&gt;2025 CNBC Disruptor 50&lt;/a&gt; list is here, and a number of health tech startups including Transcarent, Abridge and Rad AI made the cut this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Disruptor 50 designation is a ranked list of innovative private companies that are advancing breakthrough technology within their sector. Any private, independently owned startups that were founded after Jan. 1, 2010 were able to be nominated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nominated companies had to submit qualitative information, like descriptions of their core business model, which were assessed by a team of CNBC editorial staff. They also had to submit quantitative data, like sales and user numbers, which were evaluated by CNBC's Disruptor 50 Advisory Board and Disruptor 50 VC Advisory Board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the health tech companies that earned a spot this year:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#14: Transcarent.&lt;/strong&gt; Founded by longtime health-care executive Glen Tullman in 2020, Transcarent helps workers quickly access care and navigate benefits. The company has raised $940 million in total funding at a $3 billion valuation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#17: Virta Health.&lt;/strong&gt; Sami Inkinen (CEO), Stephen Phinney and Jeff Volek founded Virta Health in 2014. The startup helps patients manage diabetes and obesity, and it has raised $364.5 million at a $2.1 billion valuation, according to PitchBook.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#23: Oura.&lt;/strong&gt; This smart ring-maker has raised $200 million at a $5.2 billion valuation. The company was founded by Petteri Lahtela, Kari Kivelä and Markku Koskela and launched in 2013. The consumer and wearable technology company is now led by Tom Hale.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#26: Iambic Therapeutics.&lt;/strong&gt; Founded by Tom Miller (CEO) and Fred Manby, Iambic Therapeutics uses artificial intelligence to accelerate the pace of drug discovery and development. The company launched in 2020 and has raised $220 million.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#37: Formation Bio.&lt;/strong&gt; Benjamine Liu (CEO) and Linhao Zhang founded Formation Bio in 2016. The company uses AI to accelerate the clinical development of promising drug candidates. It has raised $600 million at a $1.7 billion valuation, according to PitchBook.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#41: Rad AI.&lt;/strong&gt; This startup uses generative AI to save radiologists time and enhance productivity. Doktor Gurson (CEO) and Jeff Chang founded the company in 2018. Rad AI has raised $143 million in funding at a $528 million valuation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#43: ElevateBio.&lt;/strong&gt; David Hallal, Vikas Sinha and Mitchell Finer founded the genetic medicines company ElevateBio in 2017. The company has raised $1.3 billion and is now led by Ger Brophy. ElevateBio is advancing treatments for cancer, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and other conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#47: Abridge.&lt;/strong&gt; This startup uses generative AI to automate the clinical documentation that doctors and nurses&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;handle. Founded by Dr. Shiv Rao (CEO) and Zack Lipton in 2018, Abridge has raised $462.5 million at a $2.7 billion valuation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, some of the major players in AI took the top five spots on this year's list. Anduril, an autonomous defense company, earned the first spot, followed by OpenAI, Databricks, Anthropic and the design platform Canva. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these five companies have a combined valuation of just under $500 billion, which is more than the combined total valuation of almost every past Disruptor 50 list of the last 12 years. A sign of the times, no doubt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full Disruptor 50 List &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/2025-cnbc-disruptor-50-see-the-full-list-of-companies.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

considered a 'probable carcinogen' - also forms during the making of french fries, potato chips, toasted bread, crackers, cookies and breakfast cereals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Mark Hyman, a top longevity expert from New York, urges people to drink more cold brew or dark roasts because the beans generally go through a less intense roasting process leading to the formation of less acrylamide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acrylamide is broken down in the body into glycidamide, a substance that can damage DNA and, according to studies in animals, raise the risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Modern processing techniques with their high temperatures lead to the formation of more acrylamide, particularly in fast foods - although levels in foods across the board remain very low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The announcement comes amid a rise in colon cancers in young people, although it is not clear whether that is linked to consuming more acrylamide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There’s a hidden chemical in many of your favorite crispy, crunchy, golden-brown foods, and it’s not on the label,' Dr. Hyman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graphic shows the foods listed by the American Cancer Society that could contain acrylamide&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Acrylamide is a byproduct of modern food processing, but it’s one we can control. Let this be your reminder today to avoid fried food.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acrylamide is created when refined sugars react with an amino acid called asparagine, which can be found in&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14082081/expert-reveals-type-coffee-thats-linked-cancer.html"&gt; coffee beans&lt;/a&gt;, potatoes, wheat, corn and rice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It forms when these foods are heated to around 248 F (120 C) or above - this is hotter than standard baking temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some studies on rodents have suggested the chemical can cause tumors to form in or on the breasts, skin and lungs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Among the studies was a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0940299314001791"&gt;2015 paper&lt;/a&gt; that found rats exposed to high levels of acrylamide over two years had a higher likelihood of suffering tumors in the breasts and thyroids than those that did not receive it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But others have found little risk of the cancer from exposure to the chemical, including when the doses are relatively low. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Studies tracking diet in humans have been &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9858116/"&gt;equally inconclusive&lt;/a&gt;, with some suggesting an increased risk of cancer among those consuming more acrylamide-laced foods while others suggest it doesn't raise risk for the disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Hector Perez, a bariatric surgeon at Renew Bariatrics in Mexico, told the Daily Mail that the current evidence does not support avoiding a cup of coffee because of this probable carcinogen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Acrylamide is a byproduct of roasting, and, yes, it's been linked to cancer in rodents at insanely high doses, but that doesn't make your morning cup a hazard,' he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'In fact, moderate coffee consumption is linked to lower risks of type 2 diabetes, liver disease and mortality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Coffee beans contain the amino acid that can react with refined sugar to form acrylamide (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'So, unless you're drowning your coffee in sugar and cream, the bigger health risk isn't acrylamide, it's fear-mongering around it.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At present, the FDA does not advise people to stop eating foods that may contain acrylamide because of the cancer risk, and says more research is needed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Instead, it currently tells people to ensure they eat a balanced diet with low sugar consumption and plenty of fruits and vegetables.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, eating your veggies can still expose you to more acrylamide as scientists say foods that have taken on a darker hue from cooking tend to contain more of the chemical.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Hyman - who appeared recently at a press briefing with the Trump administration, where he supported the announcement of the removal of artificial dyes from foods - raised the alarm over the potential threat on X, and also suggested ways to limit exposure to acrylamide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This included eating golden brown instead of dark toast, boiling and steaming foods instead of frying them and avoiding refrigerated potatoes, which contain more sugar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Hyman did not suggest that people should stop eating foods that could contain acrylamide, but instead said they should see his post as a 'warning' to consume fewer fried foods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The amount of the chemical found in foods varies greatly depending on the cooking time and temperature used, but experts say that fast and processed foods tend to be the biggest dietary sources because of the high heat used to prepare them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.myfoodresearch.com/uploads/8/4/8/5/84855864/_6__fr-2022-528_nahid.pdf"&gt;2021 Ethiopian study&lt;/a&gt;, it's estimated that potato chips contain the most acrylamide at around 211 to 3,500 micrograms per kilogram, alongside french fries, which contain 779 to 1,299 micrograms per kilogram.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The FDA has not set limits on how much acrylamide can be present in foods, but it has released guidance on how to reduce levels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Europe, regulators have acknowledged the need to set an acrylamide exposure limit, but also have not taken action to date.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But comparing it to Ozempic is “oversimplified and misleading”, she warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"wellness","tags":[{"id":"wellness/wellness","type":"Keyword","title":"Well actually"},{"id":"campaign/email/well-actually","type":"Campaign","title":"Well Actually (Newsletter sign up)"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/nutrition","type":"Keyword","title":"Nutrition"},{"id":"food/food","type":"Keyword","title":"Food"},{"id":"science/nutrition","type":"Keyword","title":"Nutrition"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","type":"Keyword","title":"Health &amp;amp; wellbeing"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"profile/madeleine-aggeler","type":"Contributor","title":"Madeleine Aggeler","bylineImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2023/10/31/Madeline_Aggeler.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=941aa4893ff7a0165c0d43241305e14e","bylineLargeImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2023/10/31/Madeline_Aggeler.png?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=237d41eba137320866c62c54d68129d8"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-lifestyle","type":"Tracking","title":"US Lifestyle"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"wellness/2025/jun/11/what-is-psyllium-husk","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;On TikTok, more than 12,500 videos boast the psyllium husk tag. But this substance is not new; it has long been popular in India and across south Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Is psyllium husk a miracle weight-loss substance? No. But there are benefits, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-psyllium-husk" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What is psyllium husk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The outer covering of any seed is called a husk. Psyllium husk comes from the seed of &lt;em&gt;Plantago ovata&lt;/em&gt; plants, a type of shrub that &lt;a href="https://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=PLOV" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;grows&lt;/a&gt; in sandy deserts and steppes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In the US, “it is best known as the active ingredient in over-the-counter laxatives like Metamucil”, says Beal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Psyllium husk can be consumed in pill or powder form. It can also be consumed whole, when is resembles tiny wood shavings. When combined with water, it creates a gloopy, gel-like substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-psyllium-husk" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What are the benefits of psyllium husk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;That gloopiness may not sound appealing, but it’s part of what makes the product useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Psyllium husk is a good source of soluble fiber, explains Katherine Zeratsky, a registered dietitian at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. Soluble fiber – unlike &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/special-topic/soluble-vs-insoluble-fiber#:~:text=Soluble%20fiber%20is%20found%20in,bran%2C%20vegetables%20and%20whole%20grains." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;insoluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which remains unchanged during digestion – attracts water during digestion and turns into a gel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This gel can soften stools and add bulk to them, which helps in the management of constipation and diarrhea, says Julia Zumpano, a registered dietitian with the Cleveland Clinic Center for Human Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2af3dcb7-dbf7-4f82-bc6d-5f42609b5773" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":12,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"What is okra water and is it good for your health?","elementId":"2af3dcb7-dbf7-4f82-bc6d-5f42609b5773","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/oct/21/okra-water-health-benefits"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Additionally, Zumpano says, this gel can bind with the bile in your gut, which is composed of cholesterol, and remove it with the body’s waste, thus reducing the amount of cholesterol in your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Beal points to a 2018 meta-analysis in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30239559/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; which found 10-15g of psyllium husk a day significantly reduced LDL (or “bad” cholesterol) and total cholesterol in “healthy individuals and those with high cholesterol”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;By slowing the rate of glucose in the bloodstream, it can also help in blood sugar management, says Zumpano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Psyllium husk can also increase one’s overall consumption of fiber, a significant benefit given that only 5% of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6124841/#:~:text=Although%20adequate%20intake%20of%20all,consume%20recommended%20amounts%20of%20fiber." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; in the US and 9% of &lt;a href="https://www.fdf.org.uk/fdf/our-work/our-campaigns/action-on-fibre/#:~:text=Currently%20only%209%25%20of%20adults,in%20the%20UK%20population%20intake." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;adults&lt;/a&gt; in the UK eat the recommended amount of 25-30g of fiber a day. Psyllium husk provides about 7g of fiber per tablespoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Eating fiber in any form has many benefits, says Zumpano, including “slowing down digestion and increasing satiety, which are both benefits of weight-loss drugs”. (She is careful to add that fiber does not accomplish either of these outcomes to the extent GLP-1s can.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-18" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She suggests starting with a powder form, which gives you control of the amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-risks-of-psyllium-husk" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What are the risks of psyllium husk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Experts emphasize that it’s extremely important to consume psyllium husk with enough water: &lt;a href="https://www.jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(17)30225-3/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;roughly&lt;/a&gt; 500ml of water per 20g of fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Because psyllium husk expands quickly with liquid, without an adequate amount of water, it can become a choking hazard and potentially lead to gastrointestinal obstruction, says Beal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This also means it may not be ideal for everyone. “People with swallowing difficulties, bowel strictures or severe gastrointestinal conditions like Crohn’s disease should consult a healthcare provider before using psyllium,” says Beal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Fiber and psyllium can also potentially interact with certain medications, warns Zeratsky, so consult a doctor or pharmacist before taking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Also, thinking of it as “nature’s Ozempic” comes with its own risks, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Overconsumption can lead to digestive discomfort, she warns, adding that people may overly rely on a single ingredient instead of a “holistic lifestyle change”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If psyllium husk isn’t your thing, there are plenty of other foods that offer similar benefits, says Zeratsky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Fruits, vegetables, beans and other legumes, and whole grains, particularly oats, barley and quinoa, all contain soluble fiber” and a variety of other beneficial nutrients, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 16:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE02Mm1wdE9ZTGRrNk1tU3J1VDRJSjJjWDgtdzg4eFphYkNMY21QdVVSSnRtYmN5M3E2a2xXYm15MUhDTGJhT1U0dWNoTEt3cHRCSUYxNF92RlVVS2ZlcGFJTDJHdjdQMUYwUHpxZnd2dUV4bFlRa3RFYmRB</guid></item><item><title>性建议：我女朋友喝醉时也想要同样鲁莽的东西。我拒绝。- Slate Magazine | Sex advice: My girlfriend wants the same reckless thing when she's drunk.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="19" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqz8jnc00173b77bitbansi@published"&gt;There are times when I will come home to find my girlfriend, “Bethany,” drunk and wanting to have sex.&lt;/p&gt;




  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqzbkz9002l3b77wkmn51dz@published"&gt;I, however, don’t feel comfortable doing this, as I believe someone who is intoxicated isn’t in a position to give consent, even with a partner. My refusals don’t sit well with her; she gets loud and belligerent before finally going to sleep it off. When she wakes up, she claims to have no memory of what occurred. Bethany doesn’t get loaded that often (only three to four times a month), but my patience with this behavior is running dry. Is this problem serious enough to warrant my demanding that she get some help?&lt;/p&gt;

They’re also within their rights to tell you to pack their bags, or to pack their own, and end the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqz8jum001b3b77iaf64ltg@published"&gt;That said, people who wake up three to four times per month with no recollection of their behavior while drunk are often resistant to changing this habit. And, generally, demands aren’t the most diplomatic way to go. So if you’re hoping to preserve the relationship and encourage Bethany to consider her relationship with alcohol, you’ll want to take a more gentle approach. Let her know what effect her drinking has on you. Tell her the situation is jeopardizing your relationship and shared living situation. Ask her whether she’s open to shifting her behavior. Then listen, and go from there.&lt;/p&gt;

This approach was led by Yuxuan Wang, an assistant professor of oncology at the &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/som/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-test-for-early-cancer-detection"&gt;Blood test for early cancer detection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed blood samples collected from individuals who had no visible signs of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-is-the-next-frontier-in-cancer-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt;. They discovered that certain tumor-related markers showed up in the bloodstream far in advance of a cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Three years earlier provides time for intervention. The tumors are likely to be much less advanced and more likely to be curable,” noted Wang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts used sensitive methods to spot changes in DNA, which is genetic material found in every cell. When tumors form, small pieces of this DNA can enter the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding such fragments takes advanced technology and careful analysis. Detecting them early may allow for better outcomes and more personalized care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-early-cancer-clues-in-blood-samples"&gt;Early cancer clues in blood samples&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used stored blood samples from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (&lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/atherosclerosis-risk-communities-aric-study" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ARIC&lt;/a&gt;) study, which has been running since the 1980s. This long-term study follows thousands of people to understand the causes of heart and vascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By going back to samples collected over three years before diagnosis, the researchers could look at real-world cases where cancer &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-scientist-discovers-that-common-non-cancer-drugs-when-combined-can-kill-cancer-cells/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;developed&lt;/a&gt; naturally over time. That makes their findings stronger because they didn’t rely on artificial lab conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-test-detects-cancer-before-symptoms"&gt;Blood test detects cancer before symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many tests only catch disease once symptoms are obvious. The study highlights a potential window of opportunity that could shift how doctors monitor at-risk individuals. Armed with this type of blood-based detection, it might be possible to begin treatments much sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study shows the promise of &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/screening/multi-cancer-early-detection-tests.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MCED tests&lt;/a&gt; in detecting cancers very early, and sets the benchmark sensitivities required for their success,” said Bert Vogelstein, co-director of the Ludwig Center at Johns Hopkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizations such as the &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/research-context-detecting-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; have supported investigations into early detection methods for several years. These efforts have broad implications for public health. When disease is found at an early stage, there is a greater possibility of simpler treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-early-detection-helps-treat-cancer"&gt;Early detection helps treat cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early identification often makes treatment easier. Targeted therapies or less aggressive interventions could become more common when irregular cells are discovered before they have time to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors may combine the blood-based tests with imaging or other types of health screening. This layered approach could lead to new pathways in cancer &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/aspirin-may-prevent-cancer-from-moving-to-other-parts-of-the-body/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;care&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are still refining how best to merge these methods without causing undue stress for patients or increasing costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-regular-blood-testing-could-save-lives"&gt;Regular blood testing could save lives&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often visit their doctors only when something feels wrong. But these findings suggest that regular blood testing, even when you feel healthy, could help catch issues before they turn serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these tests become part of routine care, doctors may one day use them the same way they check blood pressure or cholesterol. That could reshape how annual physicals are done and who gets referred for further screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-test-may-detect-more-than-cancer"&gt;Blood test may detect more than cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this study focused on cancer, the strategy of using blood samples to track emerging health concerns has broader potential. Other diseases may also produce telltale signals that show up early in circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts believe this framework could improve how doctors handle chronic illnesses. If medical teams can identify trouble before any clinical signs appear, there might be more room for preventive measures. Large-scale trials remain essential to show where these strategies fit best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-challenges-and-next-steps"&gt;Challenges and next steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain laboratories already test blood samples for tumor-related genetic hints, but refining accuracy takes time. False positives and unnecessary procedures are a concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers continue to work on standards to ensure these screening tools are both reliable and accessible to the wider population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gathering diverse data is key. Different cancers have different markers, and not all forms of the disease release the same patterns of DNA into the bloodstream. Ongoing research should show where these blood tests work well and where they do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-future-research"&gt;What this means for future research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists now have a clearer idea of the mutation levels that need to be detected for blood tests to catch cancer early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some samples showed the same DNA changes as later ones, but at levels up to 79 times lower. That gives labs a benchmark to improve test sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These insights could guide how future trials are designed.

No relationship, whether it's a friendship, marriage, or even a friend-with-benefits thing, can escape the occasional argument about something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also totally healthy to argue from time to time; far healthier than keeping it in and letting it stew. While this is true, there is such a thing as arguing too much, and doing so can affect not just your relationship but also your waistline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;According to research, couples who argue a lot tend to gain faster than couples who don't.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-06/odd-reason-couples-argue-a-lot-gain-weight-faster.png" alt="couple who argue a lot" title="the odd reason couples who argue a lot tend to gain weight faster" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Drazen Zigic / Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2802980/how-arguing-spouse-make-fat-marital-rows-depression-lead-fewer-calories-burned-meals.html"&gt;A 2014 study found&lt;/a&gt; that your excess arguing could be making you overweight. This is especially true for those &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/common-reasons-strongest-people-struggle-depression-anxiety"&gt;persons who suffer from depression&lt;/a&gt; or any type of mood disorder. The problem is that huge blowout arguments affect how high-fat foods are processed in the body and result in fewer calories being burned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/tiny-rules-separate-couples-who-fight-those-who-dont"&gt;4 Tiny Rules That Separate Couples Who Fight And Those Who Don't&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;In marriages where fighting was just a constant theme, those couples burned, on average, 31 fewer calories an hour than those who were in a marriage where arguing wasn't as frequent. &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One would think that getting fired up and shaking your hand wildly at your spouse while you try to prove your point would help you burn calories, but no such luck. Sorry, you guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 43 healthy couples who had been married for at least three years. After they were given questionnaires about their marriage, depression, and mood disorders, they were given a pretty hearty meal totaling 930 calories and 60 grams of fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/psychological-reason-so-many-couples-fight-about-dishwasher"&gt;The Psychological Reason Why So Many Couples Fight About The Dishwasher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, roughly two hours after their meal, the couples were asked to discuss topics given to them by the researchers that were specifically chosen to really &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/love/top-issues-couples-fight-about-least-most-common"&gt;get each partner ticked off and yelling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next several hours, the couples were continually tested via their blood and breathing.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqkqe0000gsnksf7beuaol@published"&gt;For over a year, I walked around feeling like my head was underwater. Tasks blurred together; it took longer to think of words. I struggled to follow conversations, and as a result experienced social anxiety for the first time in my life. On bad days, even reading a single sentence required a painful level of focus. I started calling it “brain fog,” though the term felt frustratingly vague, more of a symptom than a diagnosis. Was it just my mental health? Burnout? I’d had COVID—was it from that?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlb3r000o3577r8gll6kl@published"&gt;I tried everything: sleep, stretching, meditation, medication. I got blood panels to make sure I was healthy. The doctors I saw looked at me with a shrug. The gist was: &lt;em&gt;We can run more tests if you want, but everything seems fine. It’s probably just anxiety. Try to relax.&lt;/em&gt; The fog always returned. I felt doomed.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlb8w000p3577qqm40e1y@published"&gt;Then I came across a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9845100/"&gt;small study&lt;/a&gt; in Bioelectronic Medicine, in which researchers gave nicotine patches, the same ones that smokers use to quit cigarettes, to four long-COVID patients for up to a week. Their cognitive symptoms—things like poor concentration and memory issues—improved dramatically, according to patient surveys. The study was tiny and far from conclusive, but I was desperate and willing to give anything a try.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="66" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlbe7000q3577yfk51wp7@published"&gt;The patch seemed like a big leap, though. At 7 milligrams of nicotine, it felt like too much for me. I’ve never smoked a cigarette or vaped in my life, so this would be my introduction to the substance. I was also worried about the nausea that some people experience with the patches. So I picked up the lowest-dose nicotine gum I could find: 2 milligrams.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="148" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlbkd000r3577qkeb2h0e@published"&gt;That afternoon, I chewed a piece, feeling a bit ridiculous. I was skeptical that this potential fix would be any different from everything else I’d tried (that is, a bust). But within an hour, something had clicked. The fog didn’t lift entirely, but my brain felt like it had come back online in a way it hadn’t in months. Now, I keep a pack of gum on my desk and another in my bag, just in case. Most mornings, I pop a piece while I’m answering emails or getting ready to write. I take another before social events. Two months in, I still chew one or two pieces a day, and the symptoms have mostly stayed away. Every few weeks I can feel a hint of brain fog creeping back in, but it’s nothing like before. My concentration has skyrocketed. I feel like I have my life back.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlbnh000s3577yo5szlmw@published"&gt;To be very clear: Anyone taking nicotine to treat brain fog (like me) is still very much experimenting. There are no protocols or prescribed doses approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The evidence for nicotine’s use in otherwise-healthy people with mild cognitive issues is limited to early studies and &lt;a href="https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/nicotine-patches-for-long-covid/?pg=2"&gt;anecdotal accounts across long-COVID forums&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that for some people, it might help. There is more research on how nicotine may help people with some cognitive disorders, though this, too, is something scientists are still exploring. Overall, it might be accurate to say that nicotine “holds promise” as a potential tool for brain functioning.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="138" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlbr8000t3577j7b168rl@published"&gt;Bear with me. You might be thinking, &lt;em&gt;Isn’t nicotine bad?&lt;/em&gt; The word carries decades of baggage, mostly thanks to Big Tobacco. And there’s no doubt cigarettes (and even vapes) are terrible for your health. But when divorced from cigarettes and delivered in controlled, slow-release doses, researchers say it can, in fact, be good. “We have found that nicotine patches are useful along a whole spectrum of impairments, like people with ADHD, Alzheimer’s, and people with age-related memory and cognitive impairment,” says &lt;a href="https://psychiatry.duke.edu/profile/edward-daniel-levin"&gt;Edward Levin&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University who studies the effects of nicotine. It has also been shown to help with &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/today/2017/01/23/nicotine-normalizes-brain-deficits-key-schizophrenia"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4430096/"&gt;Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6129985/"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;. However, Levin emphasized that all those uses for nicotine patches—anything other than quitting smoking—are still under investigation. He hopes scientists will know more in the “near future.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="114" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlbvd000u35778d0i61ci@published"&gt;What we know now is that nicotine is a chemical compound that acts on receptors in the brain called nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, or nAChRs. “The word we use is &lt;em&gt;modulate&lt;/em&gt;—so they modulate nerve cell–to–nerve cell transmission throughout the brain,” says &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/ccm/person/paul-newhouse-md"&gt;Paul Newhouse&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychiatry and pharmacology and the director of the Vanderbilt Center for Cognitive Medicine at Vanderbilt University. ”They have an important role in all sorts of human behaviors and cognitive functions.” Those receptors usually respond to acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in everything from muscle activation to attention. But nicotine can bind to and activate those receptors in much the same way as acetylcholine, essentially mimicking its effects on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="159" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlbyb000v357769ym1vga@published"&gt;Nicotine’s role in facilitating attention is one of its most well-established functions. “We know that nicotine receptors are involved particularly in attention—so the ability to focus and maintain attention, all of that seems to have an important role for nicotinic signaling,” says Newhouse. “And attention is the front end of memory, right? So without attention, you can’t encode or remember anything.” That’s why it’s promising when it comes to conditions involving memory. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3466669/"&gt;In 2012&lt;/a&gt;, Newhouse and Levin published a randomized controlled trial showing that short-term nicotine use improved cognitive performance in people with mild cognitive impairment. They’re now wrapping up a larger, &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/alz.064697"&gt;multiyear follow-up study&lt;/a&gt; looking at the long-term effects of nicotine in this population, with results expected later this year.&lt;br&gt;While this kind of data could help build the case for therapeutic nicotine, doctors currently have no guidelines—and no FDA approval—to prescribe it for anything beyond smoking cessation, so many clinicians probably wouldn’t feel comfortable recommending it just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlc1a000w3577vncofv1j@published"&gt;The research on nicotine’s effects on long COVID is very new compared to other cognitive conditions, and there is yet to be a randomized controlled trial. But Marco Leitzke, who is a guest scientist at the Clinic and Polyclinic at the University of Leipzig in Germany and the researcher behind the initial nicotine and long-COVID study that I read, is optimistic about its potential. “Impaired nAChR function in the human body is the &lt;a href="https://bioelecmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42234-025-00167-8"&gt;first and only hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; that can logically explain and decipher every symptom of long COVID,” he says. Since publishing his findings, he’s continued researching dosing regimens and giving lectures to build awareness around the hypothesis that this is what’s happening with long COVID, and that nicotine can help. But to move from hypothesis to proven treatment, he says, the scientific community urgently needs double-blind, randomized, controlled trials—the gold standard for treatment research—on nicotine therapy for post-acute infection syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlc4z000x35770bpyq22l@published"&gt;Cigarettes and vapes are bad for your health because of what they do to your lungs, but that’s not the only difference between those vices and therapeutic nicotine. Compared to the near-instant delivery of a cigarette—where nicotine spikes in the brain within seconds—gum and patches release it far more gradually. “With the patch, it comes up to a plateau and stays there all day long,” says Levin. The gum—my delivery system of choice—is a little different, but it also doesn’t deliver the big hit that comes with puffing on a cigarette or a vaping device. “You have a very slow absorption, and it kind of comes to a peak, depending on how long you have it in your mouth, but it’ll gradually dissipate,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="136" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlc8j000y3577evrcjcu0@published"&gt;That slower absorption matters, not just for side effects, but for addiction risk. “Anything that you put in your body has a risk associated with it,” Levin says. “But I would say that the gum and the patches are at the very low end of the risk curve.” A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8183099/"&gt;2021 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; looked at 608 nonsmokers who were administered the patch and found that no one reported dependence. Still, nicotine isn’t side effect–free. The most common issues for nonsmokers include nausea, dizziness, or (in the case of patches) skin irritation. Many people who tried the patch to manage long-COVID symptoms have &lt;a href="https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/nicotine-patches-for-long-covid/?pg=4"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in forums that they’ve had to stop because it caused vomiting. And nicotine isn’t safe for everyone; Levin specifically warns against use during pregnancy, nursing, and in children due to potential effects on brain development.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlcav000z3577mba903pk@published"&gt;There’s another important caveat: More isn’t always better. Over Zoom, Newhouse shows me a U-shaped graph. On the x-axis: dose. On the y-axis: performance. “If you’re not working at the optimal level, then stimulating nicotinic receptors will bring you up to here or closer to here.” He points to the top of the curve, where performance is peaking. That’s the ideal case.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlcdx00103577x8zdbf5k@published"&gt;If your brain is already working well, though, nicotine can have the &lt;em&gt;opposite &lt;/em&gt;effect. “If you’re right here at the top of the curve, functioning at a high level, if I flog your nicotinic receptors, you’re actually going to have a decline in performance,” he adds. I’ve noticed this in my own nicotine use—on days when I used the gum while already feeling clearheaded, I sometimes felt jittery, not sharper. That was rare, but it reminded me that there is the potential to overdo it.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="146" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlch6001135774mg7uy5q@published"&gt;So: An article on the internet, like this one, cannot tell you that nicotine is a proven therapy for brain fog, or anything else. But if you do try it, Levin recommends going “low and slow,” and working with a doctor. Newhouse says he regularly fields questions from patients curious about trying nicotine for early Alzheimer’s concerns, though he doesn’t have data on how many physicians are actually discussing it with their patients. Both he and Levin are skeptical that nicotine will ever gain FDA approval for cognitive impairment. There’s simply no financial incentive—nicotine is too cheap, too old, and too unsexy for drug companies to invest in. “If it turns out to work for certain kinds of cognitive problems, then it’s a pretty cheap and easy-to-access treatment,” says Newhouse. “But it’s not without its side effects and risks, too. I mean, there’s no free lunch.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="43" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqlcjq00123577xnghv6si@published"&gt;For me, the uncertainty around nicotine feels like a small price to pay. The gum’s been working, so I haven’t bothered switching to patches. (Why mess with a good thing?) After a year of fog, I’m just glad to feel like myself &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Beards have long attracted suspicion, sometimes seen as stylish, sometimes as unsanitary. But how dirty are they, really?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human skin is home to billions of microorganisms – mainly bacteria, but also fungi and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="164300" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; – and facial hair provides a unique environment for them to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro.2017.157"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that beards, in particular, support a dense and diverse microbial population, which has fuelled a persistent belief that they are inherently unhygienic. The Washington Post recently &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/05/14/beards-bacteria-toilets/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that some toilets contain fewer germs than the average beard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But are beards truly a hygiene risk? A closer look at the evidence reveals a nuanced picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The microbial population on skin varies by location and is influenced by factors such as temperature, pH, humidity and nutrient availability. Beards create a warm, often moist environment where food debris and oils can accumulate – ideal conditions for microbial growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These microbes thrive not just because of the warm, moist conditions beards provide, but also because of constant exposure to new contaminants and microbes, especially from hands that frequently touch surfaces and the face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns among scientists about beard hygiene date back over 50 years. Early &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC547091/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; showed that facial hair could retain bacteria and bacterial toxins even after washing. This led to the enduring idea that beards act as bacterial reservoirs and could pose an infection risk to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For healthcare workers, this has made beards a point of controversy, especially in hospitals where pathogen transmission is a concern. However, hospital-based research has shown mixed results. One &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9542990/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that bearded healthcare workers had higher bacterial loads on their faces than clean-shaven colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00330-018-5648-z"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt;, looking at whether it would be hygienic to evaluate dogs and humans in the same  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="164300" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; scanner, found that most men's beards contained significantly more microbes than dog fur, including a greater presence of harmful bacteria. The researchers concluded: "Dogs are no risk to humans if they use the same MRI."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164309" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164309" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/dog_in_mri_642.jpg" alt="dog in an mri" class="wp-image-164309 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/dog_in_mri_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/dog_in_mri_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/dog_in_mri_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164309" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Which is less hygienic, a dog or your beard? (Zinkevych/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, other studies have challenged the idea that beards increase infection risk. For example, one investigation found &lt;a href="https://www.journalofhospitalinfection.com/article/S0195-6701(14)00090-5/fulltext"&gt;no significant difference&lt;/a&gt; in bacterial colonisation between bearded and clean-shaven healthcare workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same study also reported that bearded doctors were less likely to carry &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt;, a major cause of hospital infections, and that there was no increase in infection rates among patients treated by bearded surgeons wearing surgical masks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beards can sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/skin/beard-burn"&gt;spread skin infections&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="https://medicinetoday.com.au/dermatology-quiz/vesiculopustular-eruption-beard"&gt;impetigo&lt;/a&gt; – a contagious rash often caused by &lt;em&gt;S. aureus,&lt;/em&gt; which is commonly found in facial hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In rare cases, parasites like pubic lice – which usually live in the groin area – can also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0365059619301783"&gt;show up&lt;/a&gt; in beards, eyebrows or eyelashes, particularly in cases of poor hygiene or close contact with an infected person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The case for good beard hygiene&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neglected beards can foster irritation, inflammation and infection. The skin beneath a beard – rich in blood vessels, nerve endings and immune cells – is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27212465/"&gt;highly sensitive&lt;/a&gt; to microbial and environmental stressors. When sebum, dead skin, food debris and pollutants accumulate, they can irritate the skin and provide fuel for &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/problems-caused-by-beards"&gt;fungal and bacterial growth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC547091/"&gt;strongly recommend&lt;/a&gt; washing your beard and face every day. Doing so removes dirt, oils, allergens and dead skin, helping prevent microbial buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164310" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164310" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/beard_trim_642.jpg" alt="man getting his beard trimmed" class="wp-image-164310 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/beard_trim_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/beard_trim_642-600x388.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164310" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A well-trimmed, washed beard is no bacterial utopia. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEbw1Bn5tA/"&gt;Pavel Danilyuk from Pexels/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dermatologists also &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ics.12328"&gt;advise&lt;/a&gt; moisturising to prevent dryness, using a beard comb to clear debris, and trimming to control loose hairs and reduce shedding. These steps help maintain not only hygiene but also beard health and appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, are beards dirty? Like most things, it depends on how well you care for them. With daily hygiene and proper grooming, beards pose little risk and may even be healthier than we once thought.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256917/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

That’s not entirely surprising. Dietitians say that many people don’t know about the health benefits of eating seafood, or they may have concerns about the environmental impact and sustainability of commercial fishing. Some may be worried about exposure to mercury, a neurotoxin that’s found throughout the ocean and that can accumulate in fish.

Because they’re low on the food chain, they’re relatively low in mercury and other toxins (large predatory fish at the top of the food chain accumulate more contaminants). They’re high in protein and omega-3 fats. And they tend to be sustainable because they reproduce more rapidly than larger fish species, said Zeratsky at the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="6XBCRAWIHBEHHIYGQH2UX22JDQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="6XBCRAWIHBEHHIYGQH2UX22JDQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Rainbow trout&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LEJYN3Y2MZH2BPB3MY7K6YKONA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A single serving of rainbow trout contains more than an entire day’s worth of vitamin D and vitamin B12, as well as large amounts of omega-3 fats, protein and minerals. It has a mild flavor that makes it easy to use in a variety of dishes. It’s also a good choice for &lt;a href="https://www.seafoodwatch.org/seafood-basics/sustainable-healthy-fish/nutritious-rainbow-trout" target="_blank"&gt;environmental reasons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3NRH5EHAPNAWHC52UWPGPCOVF4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And it’s relatively affordable. Just look for tinned rainbow trout and frozen rainbow trout fillets at your grocery store. One type of rainbow trout called steelhead actually looks and tastes a lot like salmon (and it usually costs less, too). If you’ve never cooked trout before, don’t be intimidated. Consider trying this simple recipe for &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/baked-lemon-trout-caper-salsa/" target="_blank"&gt;Baked Lemon Trout with Caper Salsa&lt;/a&gt;, or this one for &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/pecan-crusted-trout-brown-butter-herb-sauce/" target="_blank"&gt;Pecan-crusted Trout with Brown Butter Herb Sauce&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="MICWIFS2VVDD5FEFW2ETKZD7X4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="MICWIFS2VVDD5FEFW2ETKZD7X4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Mussels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WSOFQLAMGBFIFF75RWG3S4LXP4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Mussels are one of the unsung heroes of the seafood world. They’re packed with protein, omega-3 fats, iron, zinc and vitamin B12. They’re very low in mercury. You can usually buy them for between $5 and $10 a pound. And most of the mussels sold in stores and restaurants are farm-raised, which is environmentally sustainable. Mussels can also be &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2020/10/29/mussels-recipe-with-three-sauces/" target="_blank"&gt;surprisingly easy&lt;/a&gt; to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="TS7W4R6ECBHWBL5SUBMCDSMOVA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="TS7W4R6ECBHWBL5SUBMCDSMOVA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Oysters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FY3GS5ZEIBGB5HVSZRSZOGZSZ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Oysters are chock full of omega-3 fats, vitamins and minerals, and they’re very low in mercury. Most oysters consumed in the United States are farm-raised and cultivated in a way that &lt;a href="https://www.seafoodwatch.org/seafood-basics/sustainable-healthy-fish/oysters" target="_blank"&gt;benefits the environment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KD5LEWINKVHQHFHJY7PCS3KK7U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Raw oysters can carry potentially harmful bacteria.

According to tests taken 18 months ago, Dr. Mohammed Enayat's biological age was 17 years younger than his chronological age. He used GlycanAge and TruAge PACE tests, which measure inflammation and epigenetics, to determine his biological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, Dr. Enayat, founder of Hum2n longevity clinic, has tracked his health for seven years using wearables like Oura ring and Whoop strap, along with regular blood, urine, and microbiome tests. Based on the results, he adjusts his longevity routine, including supplements. His core supplements include daily cycles of B complex, folate, magnesium, and omega-3 fatty acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="v-ndtv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While I believe these supplements have supported my biological age reversal, I credit them as one component in a much broader framework," Mr Enayat told &lt;em&gt;&lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/a-longevity-doctor-takes-these-3-supplements-daily-2025-6" rel="noindex,nofollow"&gt;Business Insider.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Vitamin B complex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Enayat said he takes vitamin B complex and folate supplements due to a methylation gene defect that causes elevated homocysteine levels, increasing his risk of blood clots, heart attack, and stroke. The supplements help lower these levels. Generally, dietitians recommend obtaining nutrients through food and supplementing only when necessary, such as in cases of deficiency or inability to consume certain nutritious foods. Foods rich in B vitamins, like fish, poultry, legumes, and leafy greens, can also help reduce homocysteine levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests B vitamins may be linked to improved mood and dementia prevention, but further studies are required to confirm these findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even without a methylation-related gene defect, I would still consider taking a methylated B complex, particularly during periods of high stress, poor sleep, or intensive training, as these increase the demand for B vitamins," Mr Enayat said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Magnesium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Enayat takes magnesium bisglycinate due to his naturally low magnesium levels from dietary intake. This form is chosen for its better absorption, helping to boost his levels. Magnesium is essential for bone health, blood sugar regulation, and muscle function, and can also be found in foods like legumes and leafy greens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He reported that taking magnesium helps reduce muscle aches and improves his sleep, allowing him to fall asleep more easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Omega-3 Fatty Acids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Enayat takes a daily omega-3 supplement due to his naturally low levels. Omega-3s, found in oily fish, walnuts, and chia seeds, support heart health, reduce inflammation, and lower blood pressure. While eating fatty fish weekly is proven to protect against cardiovascular disease, the benefits of supplement form are less clear. However, some research suggests omega-3 supplements may have anti-ageing effects, with a recent study finding participants who took omega-3s daily had lower biological ages.&lt;/p&gt;

As more adults cross the half-century mark, that gradual loss of mental sharpness looms large, reshaping conversations about healthy aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent work following thousands of older Europeans now argues that one everyday choice casts a bigger shadow over &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/air-pollution-weakens-brain-function-and-focus-in-daily-tasks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain function&lt;/a&gt; and cognitive decline than most people realize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research team led by University College London (&lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCL&lt;/a&gt;) analyzed lifestyle data from 32,000 adults in 14 European countries who were at least 50 years old and showed no signs of dementia when tracking began. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across as many as 15 years, participants completed memory and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9999359/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;verbal-fluency tests&lt;/a&gt;, providing one of the most detailed portraits yet of how thinking skills change in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-behaviors-linked-to-cognitive-decline"&gt;Behaviors linked to cognitive decline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators assembled sixteen lifestyle “packages” from four common habits: smoking, moderate or vigorous exercise at least once a week, weekly social contact with friends or family, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/is-marijuana-really-safer-than-alcohol-science-weighs-in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;daily alcohol intake&lt;/a&gt; capped at two drinks for men or one for women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They compared every package with a reference pattern that included all four healthy behaviors. By separating the habits instead of folding them into a single &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01254-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;wellness score&lt;/a&gt;, the team could see which ones truly moved the needle on brain performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Smoking may be among the most important lifestyle factors affecting how quickly our cognitive skills decline as we age,” suggests a new study led by UCL researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That headline finding emerged once the data were crunched: participants who smoked experienced the steepest drops in test scores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their memory and word-finding abilities fell up to 85 percent more over ten years than scores among non-smokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smoking-s-outsized-impact"&gt;Smoking’s outsized impact&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study is observational, so cannot definitively establish cause and effect, but it suggests smoking might be a particularly important factor influencing the&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/does-vaping-help-people-quit-smoking-cigarettes-new-study-breaks-it-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; rate of cognitive ageing&lt;/a&gt;,” lead author Dr. Mikaela Bloomberg explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She noted that earlier studies linked clusters of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/forming-healthy-habits-takes-much-longer-than-21-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthy habits&lt;/a&gt; to slower decline, yet those studies rarely teased apart which behaviors mattered most. By isolating each habit, the new analysis revealed that lighting up stood apart from the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, when cigarettes dropped out of the picture, the remaining lifestyle combinations produced very similar cognitive trajectories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether participants exercised a little less, enjoyed an extra drink, or skipped a weekly gathering, their brains aged at nearly the same pace as those following the reference lifestyle – as long as they did not smoke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previous evidence suggests that individuals who engage in healthier behaviors experience slower cognitive decline; however, it was unclear whether all behaviors contribute equally to cognitive decline or whether specific behaviors drive these results,” Dr. Bloomberg added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smoking-biology-and-cognition"&gt;Smoking, biology, and cognition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cigarette smoke&lt;/a&gt; exposes tiny cerebral blood vessels to a mix of toxins that stiffen vessel walls and limit oxygen flow. The same chemicals spark chronic inflammation, leaving neurons vulnerable to damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over years, those insults can accelerate the shrinkage of key brain regions linked to memory and language. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise, moderate drinking, and social engagement can bolster overall health, but they struggle to counter the direct harm tobacco inflicts on neural tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the study offered a glimmer of good news for current smokers who embrace other healthy habits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that among the healthy behaviors we examined, not smoking may be among the most important in terms of maintaining cognitive function,” Dr Bloomberg said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For people who aren’t able to stop smoking, our results suggest that engaging in other healthy behaviors such as &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/metamorphosis-exercise-triggers-molecular-changes-in-major-organs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;regular exercise&lt;/a&gt;, moderate alcohol consumption and being socially active may help offset adverse cognitive effects associated with smoking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cognitive-decline-and-global-health"&gt;Cognitive decline and global health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, about one in five adults continues to smoke, and the habit remains more common in lower-income regions where dementia care is often scarce. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because memory loss erodes independence, quitting earlier in life can spare families emotional strain and reduce medical costs tied to long-term care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new analysis strengthens the case for investing in cessation services – nicotine-replacement therapy, counseling, and prescription aids – before cognitive slips gain momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers accounted for age, gender, education, wealth, chronic illnesses, and country of residence, confirming that smoking’s influence held steady even after those factors were considered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By following participants over such a long span, the team also captured changes that shorter studies might miss, reinforcing confidence in the pattern they observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-now-that-you-know-what-will-you-do"&gt;Now that you know, what will you do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skipping cigarettes emerges as the clearest step toward safeguarding late-life thinking, yet the study suggests that pairing a smoke-free routine with modest weekly movement, sensible drinking limits, and regular social contact yields an even sturdier foundation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brisk walk through the neighborhood, a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/morning-coffee-drinkers-have-a-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cup of coffee&lt;/a&gt; with a friend, and a single evening drink offer manageable ways to keep neurons working smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive decline rarely arrives overnight, but its grip tightens with each passing year. This large-scale European study highlights how one habit – smoking – quickens the slide more than any other measured behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armed with that insight, adults can stack the odds in their favor: stub out the cigarette, stay active, connect with others, and enjoy alcohol in moderation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small choices made today shape the clarity of tomorrow’s thoughts, giving every reader a practical path toward a sharper, more confident future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49262-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 11:36:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxQUGo1SFRUMnR1R2p2ek01eS05cnlVc0tvQmljSTJsdmJpWFJFZGNibTBlOS1HaDY1UVRMVUU5YUdxb0lZeTI0QUJ3YmxYN3lCakdnYTZyOTBpZlZEMU9Lc0R3RmJCQ0RHSWd4bWktR1VRaGZReUs4N2N1UVJhS3F3cFZIbU9GUUhGOFFCOGFkNlllUUk5SFNWM1FwM0Z0TzJ4Z0s1MjVqb2NiTWVMd3M3MFV5TQ</guid></item><item><title>对于佛罗里达州的一对夫妇来说，助听器不起作用。一位医生提出了一个解决方案。-坦帕湾时报 | For a Florida couple, hearing aids weren’t working.

They’d ask one another to repeat a question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;But by a few years ago, the loss had grown so severe that the couple of four decades began to alter their routines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Once regulars at the orchestra, they no longer listened to music. Longtime trivia fanatics and frequent champions, they opted to stay home instead of straining to pick questions out of gargled noise. At dinners with friends, they’d smile and nod and hope the reaction was appropriate for wherever the conversation had drifted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“It’s debilitating,” said Dennis O’Neil. “How can you relate to people when you can’t hear them?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article__body-image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="description" class="caption"&gt;Dr. Melissa Sirois performs a hearing test on Dennis O’Neil, center, with his wife Susan O’Neil at his side during a pre-surgery appointment at the Vitale Ear, Nose &amp;amp; Throat clinic on Friday, June 6, 2025, in Zephyrhills. &lt;span class="caption__credit"&gt;[ DOUGLAS R.

Susan, who struggled with ear infections, couldn’t stand the feeling of her ears being plugged by the molds. For hearing aids to work, they need to be worn consistently. The O’Neils were never able to adapt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And so the retirement they’d dreamed of together — active and social and chock-full of quality time — was quieter than they’d hoped. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Then, in December, their doctor told them about an emerging device that could help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Like a hearing aid, the &lt;a href="https://www.cochlear.com/us/en/home/products-and-accessories/cochlear-osia-system/osia-sound-processor?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=prosp_brnd_ci_o_can_ci-prog_nuc-ev&amp;amp;utm_content=cochlearproductsosia_rsa&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=21086588150&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAADgAqWYVLnSOAp4cYrlIPR3KaYd5t&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwr5_CBhBlEiwAzfwYuCxVWKibgnDQFkqkTkp8hC0nZTR--cebHiIevx9IW_uAyT2yQJAyIxoCu-0QAvD_BwE&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cochlear.com/us/en/home/products-and-accessories/cochlear-osia-system/osia-sound-processor?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=prosp_brnd_ci_o_can_ci-prog_nuc-ev&amp;amp;utm_content=cochlearproductsosia_rsa&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=21086588150&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAADgAqWYVLnSOAp4cYrlIPR3KaYd5t&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwr5_CBhBlEiwAzfwYuCxVWKibgnDQFkqkTkp8hC0nZTR--cebHiIevx9IW_uAyT2yQJAyIxoCu-0QAvD_BwE&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds"&gt;Cochlear Osia System&lt;/a&gt; amplifies sound. But instead of sitting in the ear, the device is implanted into the skull. It uses bone vibrations to send sound directly to the inner ear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;It would require surgery, which gave the O’Neils some pause.

Dennis offered her a house tour, and they bonded over a love of music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;When Dennis tells the story, he likes to say Susan turned to him, smiling, and quipped, “I bet we could make some beautiful music together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Susan doesn’t remember it quite that way. The rest was history all the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The couple raised four kids. They moved to Texas and then Washington. Traveled to Japan and took family trips to Vancouver Island. They spent summers packed into a small RV with their kids, all string musicians at the time — violins and violas and a double-bass in tow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Dennis had a knack for finding conversation. He was the type to chat up campground guests and then invite them to spur-of-the-moment concerts put on by his kids. He made friends wherever they’d go. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;As their hearing declined, it’s that spontaneity that Dennis and Susan miss most — with strangers and each other, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;When necessity prompts it — at a doctor’s appointment or on a family video call — people will find a way to get information across. They’ll say something loudly. They’ll say it slowly. They’ll write it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;But much of human connection, Susan and Dennis have learned, lives in the in-between. The inside jokes, the witty remarks, the callbacks that don’t feel important enough to repeat five times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;When your hearing goes, those interactions do, too. The feeling of closeness starts to fade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article__body-image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="description" class="caption"&gt;The Osia System is a bone-anchored hearing aid that uses digital vibration to send sound directly into the bones of the skull, which then carry the sound to the inner ear to bypass damaged areas of the outer and middle ear. It is designed for individuals with conductive hearing loss, mixed hearing loss, or single-sided deafness, and is being implanted by Zephyrhills Dr. Joseph Derbyshire, with Vitale Ear, Nose &amp;amp; Throat, into patients Susan and Dennis O’Neil. &lt;span class="caption__credit"&gt;[ DOUGLAS R. CLIFFORD  |  Times ]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;About 30% of people ages 65 to 74, and nearly half of seniors 75 and older, live with hearing loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Not coincidentally, more than a third of U.S. seniors report feeling lonely, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Studies have found that seniors treated effectively for hearing loss &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/news/addressing-hearing-loss-may-reduce-isolation-among-elderly#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20U.S.%20Centers,with%20communication%20and%20relationship%20building." target="_blank" rel=""&gt;maintain more connections&lt;/a&gt;, while untreated hearing loss has been linked to a higher risk of &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568(23)00232-5/fulltext" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;mortality&lt;/a&gt;. One study found that people with severe hearing impairment were five times more likely to &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-hidden-risks-of-hearing-loss" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;develop dementia&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a higher risk of Alzheimer’s, too, which hits close to home for the O’Neils. Both Dennis’s and Susan’s mothers had the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Still, many seniors go without care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Insurance plans, including traditional Medicare, rarely cover hearing aids, which can cost thousands. Among adults 70 and older who could benefit from hearing aids, fewer than 1 in 3 has used them, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/statistics/quick-statistics-hearing" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;. The number is lower for &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2826274" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Black, Hispanic and other minority&lt;/a&gt; populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Now, implants like the Cochlear Osia, offer an alternative path for some — with full insurance coverage. But the process is more invasive and less known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;b&gt;Renewed hearing and hope&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Not everyone is a good candidate for the Osia implant, but doctors at Vitale Ear, Nose &amp;amp; Throat in Zephyrhills ran tests and determined that both Susan and Dennis hit the mark. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;They synced their appointments each step of the way, from a consultation to a pre-op and then surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Dennis had a harder time with recovery, since a blood thinner made healing more difficult. But when it was time to activate the devices in April, he was ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article__body-image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="description" class="caption"&gt;Dennis O'Neil, 77, left, is examined by Dr. Joseph Derbyshire during a pre-surgery appointment at the Vitale Ear, Nose &amp;amp; Throat clinic on Friday, June 6, 2025, in Zephyrhills. &lt;span class="caption__credit"&gt;[ DOUGLAS R.

It felt like hearing in technicolor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Then went Susan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Her eyes widened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“Hi Susan! How are you?” Dennis asked, gently. “Can you hear me?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Susan turned toward her husband, her face etched with smile lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“Yeah, I can,” she answered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Dennis smiled back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“We talked to one another,” he marveled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article__body-image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="description" class="caption"&gt;Dr. Joseph Derbyshire, left, greets Dennis O'Neil, 77, center, and his wife, Sudsan O’Neil, 70, while attending pre-surgery appointment at the Vitale Ear, Nose &amp;amp; Throat clinic on Friday, June 6, 2025, in Zephyrhills. &lt;span class="caption__credit"&gt;[ DOUGLAS R.

Maybe they’ll go see live music again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Most significantly, the O’Neils are talking. Not about anything of great significance. Just the little things.

Here’s what they’d never do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Discount the importance of movement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m moving all day long. And I think if everyone can make it a habit to just keep moving, our general health would be better in so many ways,” said &lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/doctors/1023498490/priya-m-freaney-md" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Priya Freaney" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nm.org/doctors/1023498490/priya-m-freaney-md" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Dr. Priya Freaney&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist and women’s heart health specialist at Northwestern Medicine in Illinois.

Most people have sitting jobs, we spend most of our day sedentary, and we know that the biggest killer of women is heart disease, so as we get older, it becomes more and more important to protect our hearts, keep those arteries clear by doing things like exercising,” added &lt;a href="https://familydoctor.org/media_ambassadors/brintha-vasagar/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Brintha Vasagar" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://familydoctor.org/media_ambassadors/brintha-vasagar/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. Brintha Vasagar&lt;/a&gt;, a family physician in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise can &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="also lessen" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;also lessen&lt;/a&gt; feelings of anxiety and depression, help you sleep better and lowers the risk of certain cancers, &lt;a href="https://www.breastcancer.org/managing-life/exercise" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="including breast cancer" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.breastcancer.org/managing-life/exercise" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;including breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.

Ignore their numbers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Vasagar and Freaney said it’s important that you know your numbers — meaning, the factors that are generally checked through routine wellness and blood tests such as your blood pressure, blood sugar levels and cholesterol, in addition to your weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people wait until they have a problem to get their numbers checked, but that isn’t the way to live a long, healthy life, noted Vasagar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s those prevention strategies — knowing what your blood pressure is, knowing what your ideal weight should be for your body size, knowing what your sugars are and if you’re at risk for diabetes — catching those things early,” Vasagar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/risk-factors/index.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Having high blood pressure and high cholesterol" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/risk-factors/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Having high blood pressure and high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; can put you at heightened risk of developing heart disease, but, lifestyle changes like diet and exercise can help get these numbers in a healthy range, and medication can help, too, noted Vasagar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s why it’s so important to know your numbers early, so you can do something about it, attack it and keep your health as optimal as possible for as long as possible,” Vasagar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Disregard their heart disease risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, heart disease is the No. 1 killer of women in the United States — a fact that many people don’t realize, said Freaney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sixty million women in the United States have some form of heart disease and 80% of that is preventable to some degree,” Freaney noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The common forms of heart diseases that can affect and ultimately kill women start early in life and accumulate silently in the body without us realizing it ... before they come to clinical significance, before we feel something that leads our doctors to discover it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earlier you can understand and address your heart disease risk factors (things like diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure) the better, Freaney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, one piece of advice is that it is never too early for a woman to seek advice about their heart health,” she noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Grace Cary via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Grace Cary via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;It's important that you know your health numbers, including blood pressure, so you can keep them in control and make changes to stay healthy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Purchase scented creams and washes for their genitals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I really tell people, and I myself, never douche or put something to cleanse your vagina,” Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re basically getting rid of the normal flora that’s supposed to be there,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flora is necessary for maintaining a healthy pH balance, maintaining a barrier against bacteria and fungal infections and more. So, disrupting it can cause problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Women are extremely, almost too, hygienic in that area because they want to smell nice, and that’s a particular area of concern,” Paik noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While lots of brands market lotions and soaps for the genital region, they aren’t necessary or even safe. “Just normal showering and washing with water is all you need to do in that area. You do not need to use soaps, perfumes, bath bombs, douching. I avoid any of that,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Skip prenatal vitamins when pregnant and trying to get pregnant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For pregnant women, I always tell them to take prenatal vitamins,” Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The folic acid in the prenatal vitamins is not the same as in multivitamins, it has an extra dose of folic acid, which is important for preventing spinal cord abnormalities in the baby,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are trying to get pregnant should also take prenatal vitamins, Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Ignore the impact that pregnancy complications can have on your heart health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Freaney, pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes can put you at higher risk of heart disease later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3034989/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Research shows" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3034989/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that people who had preeclampsia are at higher risk of stroke and&lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/diabetes-during-pregnancy-may-increase-risk-of-heart-disease" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" those who had" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/diabetes-during-pregnancy-may-increase-risk-of-heart-disease" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt; those who had&lt;/a&gt; gestational diabetes are more likely to have heart artery calcification. This is true even if your blood sugar levels and other heart health markers go back to normal after pregnancy, Freaney noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Individuals who have had pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia or gestational diabetes should have a proactive discussion with their doctors about how they can reduce their risk of heart disease,” Freaney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Suffer in silence during perimenopause and menopause.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Menopause is a big topic these days ... every woman is so different in terms of how they view and feel during menopause,” Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some folks have hot flashes and night sweats for a few months while others are plagued with tough symptoms for years and years, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how menopause impacts you, it isn’t a time to throw your hands up and say “oh well” or think you have to silently push through the discomfort. “I, myself, just realized, ‘Wow, this is the latter half of my life, I have one life to live. I better take good care of myself,’” Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I really kicked into the nutrition and exercise and just trying to keep myself healthy, rather than dealing with illness once it happens,” she noted. And going on hormone treatment is also a good option for many women, Paik added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know that estrogen has been a really hot topic, and that also is one of those things where our medical opinions on hormone replacement and the benefits and risks of estrogen have changed over time as we’ve gotten more information,” Vasagar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a while, women strayed away from hormone treatments because of fears of breast cancer risk, Vasagar noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now, I think we’re starting to get back into how can we use hormones to benefit women, protecting their heart health, protecting from osteoporosis, while also mitigating any risk that each individual has towards breast cancer and some other things that estrogen can contribute to,” Vasagar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Ignore the impact menopause has on cardiovascular health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/menopause" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="menopause" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/topic/menopause" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt; bring hot flashes, mood changes and bone density loss, it also brings negative changes to heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a big shift that happens there. We lose our natural estrogen levels, and with the loss of natural estrogen, our whole cardiometabolic profile shifts for the worst,” Freaney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I try to counsel my female patients that the years around menopause are really a time of accelerating cardiovascular risk, and we need to go into that decade of life in the most optimal cardiovascular health to brace ourselves for this transition that is going to inevitably come to every woman,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around menopause, your blood pressure increases, your LDL cholesterol (also known as the bad cholesterol) goes up and your HDL cholesterol (your good cholesterol) goes down, according to Freaney. Your fat mass goes up while your muscle mass goes down, she added. Your sleep and mood worsens, too, which can have downstream effects on exercise and nutrition — because who wants to go for a bike ride after a night of bad sleep?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

Most people have sitting jobs, we spend most of our day sedentary, and we know that the biggest killer of women is heart disease, so as we get older, it becomes more and more important to protect our hearts, keep those arteries clear by doing things like exercising,” added &lt;a href="https://familydoctor.org/media_ambassadors/brintha-vasagar/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Brintha Vasagar" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://familydoctor.org/media_ambassadors/brintha-vasagar/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. Brintha Vasagar&lt;/a&gt;, a family physician in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise can &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="also lessen" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;also lessen&lt;/a&gt; feelings of anxiety and depression, help you sleep better and lowers the risk of certain cancers, &lt;a href="https://www.breastcancer.org/managing-life/exercise" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="including breast cancer" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.breastcancer.org/managing-life/exercise" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;including breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Skip out on nutrition. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three experts told HuffPost that healthy eating is one of the pillars they stick to for their current health and future health. This means fresh foods and less meat for &lt;a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/obgyn/team/777/clara-paik---gynecology---obstetrics-and-gynecology-sacramento/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Clara Paik" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://health.ucdavis.edu/obgyn/team/777/clara-paik---gynecology---obstetrics-and-gynecology-sacramento/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Dr. Clara Paik&lt;/a&gt;, the co-chief of the division of general obstetrics and gynecology at UC Davis Health in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vasagar described diet as well-being 101 and said she limits processed foods and focuses on lean meats, fresh fruits and veggies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freaney said she follows an 80-20 rule, where 80% of the time she eats nutritious foods and the other 20% of the time she chooses foods that may not have a big nutritional benefit but are celebratory or joy-inducing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freaney also tries to limit bready sweets, overall, because of their high levels of cholesterol and saturated fats. She also cooks at home often and makes extra so she has easy, healthy meals throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Ignore their numbers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Vasagar and Freaney said it’s important that you know your numbers — meaning, the factors that are generally checked through routine wellness and blood tests such as your blood pressure, blood sugar levels and cholesterol, in addition to your weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people wait until they have a problem to get their numbers checked, but that isn’t the way to live a long, healthy life, noted Vasagar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s those prevention strategies — knowing what your blood pressure is, knowing what your ideal weight should be for your body size, knowing what your sugars are and if you’re at risk for diabetes — catching those things early,” Vasagar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/risk-factors/index.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Having high blood pressure and high cholesterol" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/risk-factors/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Having high blood pressure and high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; can put you at heightened risk of developing heart disease, but, lifestyle changes like diet and exercise can help get these numbers in a healthy range, and medication can help, too, noted Vasagar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s why it’s so important to know your numbers early, so you can do something about it, attack it and keep your health as optimal as possible for as long as possible,” Vasagar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Disregard their heart disease risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, heart disease is the No. 1 killer of women in the United States — a fact that many people don’t realize, said Freaney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sixty million women in the United States have some form of heart disease and 80% of that is preventable to some degree,” Freaney noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The common forms of heart diseases that can affect and ultimately kill women start early in life and accumulate silently in the body without us realizing it ... before they come to clinical significance, before we feel something that leads our doctors to discover it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earlier you can understand and address your heart disease risk factors (things like diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure) the better, Freaney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, one piece of advice is that it is never too early for a woman to seek advice about their heart health,” she noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Grace Cary via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Grace Cary via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;It's important that you know your health numbers, including blood pressure, so you can keep them in control and make changes to stay healthy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Purchase scented creams and washes for their genitals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I really tell people, and I myself, never douche or put something to cleanse your vagina,” Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re basically getting rid of the normal flora that’s supposed to be there,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flora is necessary for maintaining a healthy pH balance, maintaining a barrier against bacteria and fungal infections and more. So, disrupting it can cause problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Women are extremely, almost too, hygienic in that area because they want to smell nice, and that’s a particular area of concern,” Paik noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While lots of brands market lotions and soaps for the genital region, they aren’t necessary or even safe. “Just normal showering and washing with water is all you need to do in that area. You do not need to use soaps, perfumes, bath bombs, douching. I avoid any of that,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Skip prenatal vitamins when pregnant and trying to get pregnant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For pregnant women, I always tell them to take prenatal vitamins,” Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The folic acid in the prenatal vitamins is not the same as in multivitamins, it has an extra dose of folic acid, which is important for preventing spinal cord abnormalities in the baby,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are trying to get pregnant should also take prenatal vitamins, Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Ignore the impact that pregnancy complications can have on your heart health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Freaney, pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes can put you at higher risk of heart disease later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3034989/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Research shows" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3034989/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that people who had preeclampsia are at higher risk of stroke and&lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/diabetes-during-pregnancy-may-increase-risk-of-heart-disease" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" those who had" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/diabetes-during-pregnancy-may-increase-risk-of-heart-disease" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt; those who had&lt;/a&gt; gestational diabetes are more likely to have heart artery calcification. This is true even if your blood sugar levels and other heart health markers go back to normal after pregnancy, Freaney noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Individuals who have had pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia or gestational diabetes should have a proactive discussion with their doctors about how they can reduce their risk of heart disease,” Freaney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Suffer in silence during perimenopause and menopause.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Menopause is a big topic these days ... every woman is so different in terms of how they view and feel during menopause,” Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some folks have hot flashes and night sweats for a few months while others are plagued with tough symptoms for years and years, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how menopause impacts you, it isn’t a time to throw your hands up and say “oh well” or think you have to silently push through the discomfort. “I, myself, just realized, ‘Wow, this is the latter half of my life, I have one life to live. I better take good care of myself,’” Paik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I really kicked into the nutrition and exercise and just trying to keep myself healthy, rather than dealing with illness once it happens,” she noted. And going on hormone treatment is also a good option for many women, Paik added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know that estrogen has been a really hot topic, and that also is one of those things where our medical opinions on hormone replacement and the benefits and risks of estrogen have changed over time as we’ve gotten more information,” Vasagar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a while, women strayed away from hormone treatments because of fears of breast cancer risk, Vasagar noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now, I think we’re starting to get back into how can we use hormones to benefit women, protecting their heart health, protecting from osteoporosis, while also mitigating any risk that each individual has towards breast cancer and some other things that estrogen can contribute to,” Vasagar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Ignore the impact menopause has on cardiovascular health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/menopause" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="menopause" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68483ad7e4b0c1bc4e818f97" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/topic/menopause" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt; bring hot flashes, mood changes and bone density loss, it also brings negative changes to heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a big shift that happens there. We lose our natural estrogen levels, and with the loss of natural estrogen, our whole cardiometabolic profile shifts for the worst,” Freaney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I try to counsel my female patients that the years around menopause are really a time of accelerating cardiovascular risk, and we need to go into that decade of life in the most optimal cardiovascular health to brace ourselves for this transition that is going to inevitably come to every woman,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around menopause, your blood pressure increases, your LDL cholesterol (also known as the bad cholesterol) goes up and your HDL cholesterol (your good cholesterol) goes down, according to Freaney. Your fat mass goes up while your muscle mass goes down, she added. Your sleep and mood worsens, too, which can have downstream effects on exercise and nutrition — because who wants to go for a bike ride after a night of bad sleep?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

If human hemoglobin is present, blood has likely leaked into the digestive system, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://divisionofresearch.kaiserpermanente.org/researchers/levin-theodore/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Theodore R.

Well, cancerous tissue — and even large benign polyps — is more likely to bleed than normal health tissue in the colon, Levin said. But the blood isn’t always noticeable when you go to the bathroom. In fact, the FIT was designed because growing polyps and cancers tend to microscopically bleed, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/luigi_ricciardiello.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Luigi Ricciardiello" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="683f1e5ce4b049ed4229b599" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/luigi_ricciardiello.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Luigi Ricciardiello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a professor of medicine in the department of gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;in Houston.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A positive result indicates there’s blood in your stool, which could mean you have colorectal cancer. That said, abnormal test results do not automatically mean you have cancer, as there are other health conditions, like hemorrhoids or benign polyps, that also cause bleeding. If your FIT finds blood, however, you’ll definitely want to follow up with a colonoscopy to get an accurate diagnosis, Levin advised. “A positive FIT test should never be the end test. A next step is needed,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ricciardiello said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Thomas Barwick via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Thomas Barwick via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;You don't have to wait until you're 45 to begin early detection.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How effective are FITs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Very.

								&lt;p&gt;Post-pandemic amnesia is a natural reaction, and it’s common for misremembering to occur after a pandemic or collective traumatic event occurs. Yet the reality is that SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/covid-19" target="_blank"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, is still finding ways to infect people by evolving new mutations, and a new variant has raised concern among virologists that continue to track the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;labeled&lt;/a&gt; the COVID variant NB.1.8.1 a “variant under monitoring” because it has been surging across Asia and made up 10.7% of global sequences reported as of mid-May. Now, the variant has been detected in the United States, Europe and Canada as well, concerning virus trackers who — for the first time since the &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2023/08/20/a-new-variant-nicknamed-pirola-is-raising-global-alarm-but-dont-freak-out-yet/" target="_blank"&gt;Pirola variant began circulating in August 2023&lt;/a&gt; — bestowed upon it a nickname: Nimbus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nimbus has recombined genetic material from other strains three times. Although the process of &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/11/14/recombinant-strains-explainer/" target="_blank"&gt;recombination is a natural process&lt;/a&gt; of viruses trying to evolve to survive among the population, recombination events are concerning because each time a virus does so, it has the potential to evolve into something that is more infectious or causes more severe disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these mutations in Nimbus allows it to evade the immunity we have built against the virus from prior infections, so transmissibility might be slightly higher, said Dr. Rajendram Rajnarayanan, of the New York Institute of Technology campus in Jonesboro, Arkansas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.30.651462v1"&gt;preprint study&lt;/a&gt;, not yet peer-reviewed, found that the way this variant binds to cells could make it infect them more efficiently than earlier strains and that it could be easier for this strain to be passed along to someone else. However, there has not been any evidence yet to suggest that Nimbus is linked to more severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nimbus "is a strong candidate for the summer surge."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We haven’t seen a big surge in emergency departments due to COVID-related conditions and respiratory things in this term yet,” Rajnarayanan told Salon in a video call. “We have to wait and watch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, many people have been reporting a symptom called “razor blade throat,” but it’s unclear if this is a symptom of COVID or one of the many other viruses circulating. Overall, it is difficult to attribute certain symptoms to variants when there are more than a dozen circulating at a time and testing remains relatively low compared to earlier stages of the pandemic, said Dr. T. Ryan Gregory, an evolutionary and genome biologist at the University of Guelph in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That said, we learned from &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2023/05/02/as-mutates-the-vaccine-goalpost-has-shifted-to-preventing-severe-illness-and/" target="_blank"&gt;Omicron&lt;/a&gt; that high transmissibility can cause as much damage as high per infection virulence, and at this point it is not just acute severity that is of concern, but longer-term impacts of repeated infection,” Gregory told Salon in an email. Such impacts include conditions like "&lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2023/08/13/long-is-devastating-and-far-from-rare-as-infections-rise-again-why-are-we-still-ignoring-it/" target="_blank"&gt;long COVID&lt;/a&gt;," in which the symptoms of COVID last for months or years, often disabling patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, current data shows that most COVID infections in the U.S. are &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions"&gt;currently caused by the LP.8.1 variant&lt;/a&gt;, which descends from Pirola. Both of these strains are technically still in the WHO’s Greek letter “Omicron” family, which now contains thousands of offspring. If there's one thing viruses are good at, it's mutating into new forms that can evade our immunity, whether that's from vaccines or past infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the WHO decided to &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/updated-working-definitions-and-primary-actions-for--sars-cov-2-variants" target="_blank"&gt;only name variants with this system if they were considered a “variant of concern”&lt;/a&gt; and stated that certain action steps should be taken by countries if a variant fell under this classification. However, the agency has not labeled any variants like this since Omicron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/covid-variant-namer-gregory-6e8e9d3d"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt; that some variants have been different enough to warrant a new name, and that not naming variants makes it more difficult to distinguish between the complex alphabet soup of variants that are circulating at any given time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Pirola, which included the BA.2.86 variant along with its descendants, was about as genetically different from the original Omicron strain as Omicron was from the original “wild strain” virus from Wuhan, China. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in the past two years, “it’s largely been the Pirola show,” Gregory said. Current vaccines have been designed to protect against this strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, Nimbus is not very common in the U.S., but it has been identified in California and has enough mutations in its spike protein that it has a potential to cause waves of illness in other regions — which is in part why it was designated a name. At-home tests should still work to detect this variant, but PCR tests that doctors can order are more accurate. Masking also helps prevent the spread of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year following the start of the COVID pandemic, cases have surged in the summer. Last year's summer surge hit around August and was so intense that &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/08/22/is-getting-so-bad-new-vaccines-were-given-early-approval/" target="_blank"&gt;vaccines were approved slightly early&lt;/a&gt;. Although this year's summer wave hasn't yet started, experts predict we will likely experience another wave this summer. As it stands, variant trackers expect either Nimbus or another variant called XFG to be the dominant strain this time around. Although XFG currently makes up a greater proportion of cases in North America than NB.1.8.1, the latter has been &lt;a href="https://www.syracuse.com/coronavirus/2025/06/new-covid-variant-in-ny-what-to-know-about-symptoms-cases-vaccines.html" target="_blank"&gt;detected in New York&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-05-30/a-new-covid-subvariant-spreads-rapidly-as-trump-pivots-away-from-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“NB.1.8.1 is a strong candidate for the summer surge,” Rajnarayanan said. “Yet what we know from previous instances is that it doesn't have to be a single variant that pushes up [to prominence] and sometimes it can be a group of variants … that pick up mutations from each other and recombine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that Nimbus is still similar enough to the Pirola variants that the available vaccines were designed to target. That means they should still be effective, Gregory said. However, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-picks-new-strain-fall-covid-vaccines-means-shot-rcna208726"&gt;concerns have been raised&lt;/a&gt; that vaccine access may be limited this fall due to the Food and Drug Administration announcing it would require drugmakers to conduct a new set of clinical trials before approving new vaccines for use. Last month, the FDA also said it will &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/fda-significantly-limits-covid-19-vaccine-recommendations" target="_blank"&gt;only recommend&lt;/a&gt; COVID vaccines for adults 65 and older and those at risk for severe illness. Critics have said this will only make the vaccines &lt;a href="https://abc7.com/post/covid-19-vaccine-what-know-new-trump-policy-limits/16488196/" target="_blank"&gt;less likely to be covered by insurance&lt;/a&gt; and less available overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy announced he was &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/rfk-jr-hhs-moves-to-restore-public-trust-in-vaccines-45495112"&gt;firing the expert panel&lt;/a&gt; that advises the Centers for Disease Control responsible for making recommendations on vaccines, further complicating matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paired with updated guidelines from the CDC that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/27/nx-s1-5413179/covid-vaccine-children-pregnant-rfk-cdc"&gt;drop recommendations for healthy pregnant women and kids&lt;/a&gt; to routinely get vaccinated, these changes from the federal government could have a chilling effect that leads fewer people to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m concerned about accessibility,” Rajnarayanan said, adding that it’s not clear if vaccines will be available to people without insurance that aren’t included in federal recommendations. “These kinds of things are still murky and I really want to see clearer guidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many people may seem to have forgotten about COVID, people are still routinely hospitalized and killed by the virus. Additionally, each COVID nfection carries a risk of going on to develop long Covid, which continues to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/health/long-covid-world.html"&gt;debilitate millions of people&lt;/a&gt;. As we witnessed when COVID was a full-blown pandemic, emerging viruses can be especially damaging for people with existing conditions like diabetes, obesity and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to protect against things like long COVID not only for the well-being of people today but also for our susceptibility to future viruses, Rajnarayanan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In different parts of the world, I’ve seen funding for continuous surveillance gone down, and not just for surveillance, which is important, but also studying the disease itself,” Rajnarayanan said. “This is not just about protecting [people] today but also protecting them from any other variant in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;

It formed about 11,000 years ago when a fist of magma punched up into the rolling hills of central France,  creating a volcano that spilled out lava before going dormant just a few hundred years later. For the past twenty years or so, a weather station on top of Puy de Dôme has been equipped with air samplers. The mountain is so high that clouds regularly blanket its peak, allowing scientists to capture some of the life they ferry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Studies led by Pierre Amato, an aerobiologist at the nearby University of Clermont Auvergne, have revealed that every millimeter of cloud water floating over Puy de Dôme &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182869" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;contains as many as 100,000 cells&lt;/a&gt;. Their DNA has revealed that some belong to familiar species, but many &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1186847/full" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;are new to science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Scientists who use DNA to identify species are perpetually anxious about contamination, and Amato is no exception. A hawk soaring over Puy de Dôme might fly over Amato's tubes and shake microbes off its feathers, for example. In Amato's laboratory, a graduate student may exhale germs into a test tube. Over the years, Amato has rejected thousands of potential species, suspicious that he or his students have inadvertently smeared skin microbes onto the equipment. But they have confidently discovered over &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182869" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;28,000 species of bacteria in clouds&lt;/a&gt;, and over 2,600 species of fungi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Amato and other scientists who study clouds suspect that they may be particularly good places for bacteria to survive – at least for some species. "Clouds are environments open to all, but where only some can thrive," Amato and a team of colleagues wrote in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;In a cloud, each microbe exists in perfect solitude, trapped in its own droplet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For bacteria, a cloud is like an alien world, dramatically different from the habitats where they usually live on land or at sea. Bacteria typically crowd together. In rivers they may grow into microbial mats. In our guts, they form dense films. But in a cloud, each microbe exists in perfect solitude, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809510001791" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;trapped in its own droplet&lt;/a&gt;. That isolation means that cloud bacteria don't have to compete with each other for limited resources. But a droplet doesn't have much room to carry the nutrients microbes need to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Yet Amato and his colleagues have found evidence that some microbes can indeed grow in clouds. In one study, the researchers compared samples they gathered from clouds on Puy de Dôme to others they collected on the mountain on clear days. The researchers looked for clues to their activity by comparing the amount of DNA in their samples to the amount of RNA. Active, growing cells will make a lot of copies of RNA from their DNA in order to produce proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The researchers found that the ratio of RNA to DNA was &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/22/1257/2025/bg-22-1257-2025.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;several times higher in clouds than in clear air&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful clue that cells thrive in clouds.

Even at temperatures far below the freezing point, water molecules can remain liquid. One way to trigger the formation of ice, however, is to give them a seed of impurity. As water molecules stick to a particle's surface, they bond to one another, a process known as nucleation. Other water molecules then lock onto them and assemble into a crystal structure, which when heavy enough, will fall out of the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It turns out that biological molecules and cell walls are exceptionally good at triggering rain. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0140407" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Fungi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/aem.01850-20" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;algae&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/5/4/044015/meta" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;pollen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bioone.org/journals/lindbergia/volume-38/issue-1/linbg.01070/Ubiquity-of-ice-nucleation-in-lichen--possible-atmospheric-implications/10.25227/linbg.01070.full" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;lichens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2003JD003545" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/18/4431/2021/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; can &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/10/12/786" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;seed ice in clouds&lt;/a&gt;.

Venus, for example, has a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead. But the clouds that blanket Venus &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://science.nasa.gov/venus/venus-facts/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;are much cooler&lt;/a&gt;, and perhaps able to sustain life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Pseudomonas bacteria are commonly found in the soil and on plants, but they may be particularly well adapted as the seeds for ice formation (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Pseudomonas bacteria are commonly found in the soil and on plants, but they may be particularly well adapted as the seeds for ice formation (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Sara Seager, an astrobiologist at MIT, has speculated that life might have arisen on the surface of Venus early in its history, when it was cooler and wetter. As the planet heated up, some microbes &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2020.2244" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;could have found refuge in the clouds&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of sinking back to the surface, they may have bobbed up and down in the atmosphere, riding currents for millions of years, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Thinking about Seager's alien aerobiome can make cloud-gazing even more enjoyable. But when we look at clouds, Amato's research has revealed, we are also looking up at our own influence on the world. When Amato and his colleagues have surveyed the genes in the microbes they capture, they find a remarkable number that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.161264" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;endow bacteria with resistance to antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Down on the ground, we humans have spurred the widespread evolution of these resistance genes. By taking excessive amounts of penicillin and other drugs to fight infections, we favour mutants that can withstand them. Making matters worse, farmers feed antibiotics to chickens, pigs and other livestock in order to get them to grow to bigger sizes. In 2014 alone, 700,000 people died worldwide from infections of antibiotic‑resistant bacteria. Five years later, the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;toll rose to 1.27 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The evolution of antibiotic resistance occurs within the bodies of humans and the animals humans eat. The bacteria endowed with this resistance then escape their nurseries and make their way through the environment – into the soil, into streams, and it turns out, even into the air. Researchers have found high levels of resistance genes in the bacteria &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-021-01197-5" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;floating through hospitals&lt;/a&gt; and around &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412023000247" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;pig farms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Winds can carry dust and microbes over hundreds and sometimes thousands of miles (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Winds can carry dust and microbes over hundreds and sometimes thousands of miles (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But airborne resistance genes can waft even further. An international team of scientists inspected the filters in automobile air conditioners in nineteen cities around the world. The filters had captured a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.8b02204" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;rich diversity of resistant bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. It appears, in other words, that resistance genes float through cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In recent years, Amato and his colleagues have charted even longer journeys. In a 2023 survey of clouds, they reported finding bacteria carrying &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722083681" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;29 different kinds of resistance genes&lt;/a&gt;.  A single airborne bacterium may carry as many as nine resistance genes, each providing a different defense against the drugs. Every cubic metre of cloud, they estimated, held up to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722083681" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;10,000 resistance genes&lt;/a&gt;. A typical cloud floating overhead may hold more than a trillion of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Amato and his colleagues speculate that clouds hold such a high number of resistance genes because they can help the bacteria survive there. Some genes provide antibiotic resistance by allowing bacteria to pump the drugs out of their interiors quickly, getting rid of them before they can cause damage. The stress of life in a cloud may cause bacteria to produce toxic waste that they need to pump out quickly as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Clouds may be able to spread these resistance genes farther than contaminated meat and water. Once in a cloud, bacteria can travel hundreds of miles in a matter of days before seeding a raindrop and falling back to Earth. When they reach the ground, the microbes may then pass along their resistance genes to other microbes they encounter. Every year, Amato and his colleagues estimate, 2.2 trillion trillion resistance genes &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://cnrs.hal.science/hal-04300300v1/document" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;shower down from the clouds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It is a sobering thought to hold in one's mind on a walk through the rain.

And that’s not a healthy strategy, said Alison Brown, a nutrition researcher at the National Institutes of Health. Diets like these can cause you to miss out on the range of nutrients your body requires, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;A much better way to maintain healthy eating habits, she added, is to focus on foods that are not only nourishing, but also bring you joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;That can be challenging when nutrition fads are coming and going with seemingly increasing speed, and often conflicting advice.

In one case, a patient refused transfusion from the standard donor pool — insisting on receiving only blood from unvaccinated individuals — and ultimately experienced severe complications during surgery due to delayed transfusion, despite multiple consults and clear explanations that vaccination status has no impact on blood safety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These encounters underscore the growing challenge of misinformation and the ethical tension between respecting autonomy and protecting patients from preventable harm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The safety of the blood supply in the United States and other high-income countries relies on rigorous donor selection and laboratory-based donor testing. The policies, processes, and practices have been refined over decades to ensure both optimal safety and sufficiency of the blood supply. There is overwhelming evidence that anonymous, voluntary donors pose the lowest risk to transfusion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet requests for directed blood donation — blood donated by a specific donor for a specific recipient — have increased since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. These requests most commonly arise from patients or parents who want blood from “unvaccinated” donors. My colleagues and I (an international team of transfusion specialists, ethicists, legal experts, and public health researchers) examined this development in a paper published in &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00815" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. We found that these requests, though often framed as personal preference, raise significant ethical, medical, and logistical concerns that challenge the safety, equity, and integrity of the blood supply.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Directed blood donation is not new. In the early 1980s, shortly after the discovery of HIV and prior to the availability of tests for the virus, some patients made requests for relatives or friends to donate, assuming that they would be safer than community blood donors. Advances in donor screening, infectious-disease testing, and blood processing have since rendered standard donations extraordinarily safe, and directed donation declined. Covid-19 prompted a resurgence in requests, given concerns from some people regarding harmful effects of then-nascent mRNA vaccines. National utilization data show an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10543447/#:~:text=Of%20the%2010%2C764%2C000%20units%20transfused,units)%20were%20for%20autologous%20transfusions." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;11% increase in directed-donor transfusions from 2019 to 2021&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. That is the most recent year for which peer-reviewed data are available, but anecdotally, it seems that this trend has continued or even increased.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;While there are no licensed tests that can reliably determine whether a donor has been vaccinated against Covid-19, directed donation and “unvaccinated blood” have been promoted by some groups, prompting legislators in several U.S. states to introduce bills that could require hospitals to honor such requests. None of those proposals has become law, but the debate has drawn public attention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many people assume that directed donations are inherently safer, or that receiving blood from a relative increases the likelihood of a better outcome from transfusion. However, this is not supported by evidence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, directed donors are often first-time or infrequent donors. Because of this, they are more likely to pose risks to blood safety. Large studies cited in our review indicate that first-time parental donors have higher rates of markers for transfusion-transmissible infections than community donors (8.6% vs. 1.1% in one series). A likely reason is social pressure: People donating for someone they know may not disclose high-risk behaviors on the donor history questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second, when a donor is a relative, partial genetic matching can — perhaps surprisingly — increase the risk of transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD), a rare but often fatal complication. To prevent TA-GVHD, cellular blood components from related donors must be irradiated, which reduces the shelf life of the donated blood and adds cost. Mother-to-child donations elevate the risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury, and transfusions between reproductive partners can lead to immune responses that can harm future pregnancies by attacking the fetus’s red blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are other problems with directed donations. Every directed unit must be collected, labeled, and stored separately. If the intended patient ultimately does not need the blood, the unit may be discarded because it was kept out of routine inventory rotation. Directed donations cannot be mobilized quickly in emergencies; the blood may arrive too late or in insufficient quantity for patients with large transfusion requirements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, extensive surveillance has found no difference in outcomes between recipients of blood from vaccinated versus unvaccinated donors. Because directed donation introduces additional infectious and logistic risks without offsetting medical advantages, our group concluded that it should be reserved for rare, medically justified situations such as patients with rare blood types and/or multiple antibodies, both of which may pose challenges for procurement of blood from community (i.e., random) blood donors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So what should doctors do with a patient insisting on “unvaccinated blood”?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the ethical principle of autonomy argues that we as physicians provide patients the ability to make their own decisions, it does not obligate health care providers to provide non-evidence-based or potentially harmful products or interventions, which is what our analysis argues that directed donations are. As such, if the patient outright refuses any other blood product, that is their prerogative, but physicians should not acquiesce to provide a directed or Covid-19 vaccine negative unit to meet their needs, as there are no data that supports the efficacy of this product — but numerous data suggest it is more harmful.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blood is a limited, life-saving resource. Policies that allocate it are designed to balance autonomy, safety, and equity. Granting non-medical donor preferences can unintentionally undermine that balance:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equity: Allowing one preference may legitimize another, even if not health-related; examples include requests based on race or gender.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Public trust: Segregating blood on grounds that are not supported by evidence could imply that standard blood is inferior, eroding confidence in established safety measures.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Supply strain: Redirecting donors toward specific recipients reduces the community pool and can exacerbate shortages, particularly during crises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Our analysis recommends that health systems and policymakers continue to prioritize anonymous, need-based allocation and decline directed donation requests that lack medical necessity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Transfusion services in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand have reported similar inquiries about unvaccinated blood. Many patients accept explanations once they learn how universal screening works, though a subset remain concerned. To date, professional bodies such as the Canadian Blood Services and the New Zealand Blood Service have maintained policies that disallow non-medically indicated directed donations, reinforcing consistency across systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given the political climate and ubiquity of misinformation, I suspect that requests for unvaccinated blood will continue apace or even increase. But clear patient-centered communication and transparent publishing of safety data have historically reduced unwarranted fears about blood transfusion. The key is sustained, fact-based engagement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That kind of engagement requires:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plain language: Clinicians should explain that blood banks do not record vaccination status and that strict testing and donor deferral using the donor history questionnaire makes blood that is donated by anonymous community donors safe for transfusion.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Clear institutional policy: Hospitals should have consistent procedures for handling directed-donation requests, including medical-director review and documentation of informed refusal if a patient declines standard blood.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Professional alignment: National and international societies can issue statements affirming that non-evidence-based directed donation is discouraged, providing clinicians with an authoritative reference.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Legislative outreach: Sharing data with policymakers before new bills are drafted can help avert well-intended but impractical mandates that could compromise safety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Directed blood donation occupies a small corner of transfusion practice, but a visible one. By discussing the risks and lack of benefit more clearly with patients, I hope that we can uphold public confidence in our rigorously tested donor system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating mangoes can do more than just satisfy your sweet tooth. Eating mangoes regularly has been linked to many positive health outcomes, in part thanks to their &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290550/10-everyday-superfoods/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;naturally occurring good-for-you nutrients&lt;/a&gt; like beta carotene and a range of plant compounds such as phenolics, polyphenols and tannins.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, one study found that adults eating certain types of mango pulp daily for eight weeks experienced a noticeable drop in their systolic blood pressure, which is important for heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While these findings are promising, more research is needed to understand if these benefits apply to other groups, like postmenopausal women, who are at risk for heart and metabolic issues.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To conduct this study, researchers recruited women ages 50 to 70 who were postmenopausal and living in California. This study was conducted over four weeks, with participants attending three study visits. Before each visit, the participants avoided strenuous exercise for 24 hours, and they came to the research center after fasting overnight.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The women were also instructed not to eat mangoes at least a week before the first visit or during the study. Participants also submitted sets of food logs during the study, so researchers could get a sense of their typical eating habits. At the first visit, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-blood-pressure-factors-study-11742722" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;health measurements like blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and body stats were taken after a period of rest. Two hours later, measurements were repeated to check for any changes.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the second visit two weeks later, participants ate 330 grams of mango, or about 2 cups of the fruit. Researchers conducted health checks before participants ate mango and two hours after. They were then asked to eat one packet of frozen mango (330 grams) daily for the next two weeks—half in the morning and the other half in the evening. At the final visit, after another overnight fast, the same health checks were repeated, participants ate mango again and more measurements were taken two hours later. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Based on the results from the first study, researchers conducted a follow-up trial with just six participants. Measurements like blood pressure and blood samples were taken before they ate anything, then again one hour and two hours later. On one visit, they ate fresh mango pulp. On another visit, they consumed white bread with similar calories and carbohydrates as the mango. Measurements were repeated at the same time intervals after eating to study any changes in blood pressure and blood markers. Each visit was spaced at least two days apart.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study began with 28 participants. However, one person did not complete the study, and three others had issues with their data that prevented it from being included in the final analysis. At the end of the study, 24 participants were evaluated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study found that eating mangoes had specific effects on heart and blood pressure measurements. Initially, there was no noticeable difference in arterial stiffness between the study visits. However, after eating mango pulp, arterial stiffness was reduced by 35% to 38% two hours later during both mango-eating periods. Arterial stiffness is a measurement of the flexibility of your blood vessels—basically, how easily they respond to changes in blood pressure. Stiff arteries can be a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/happiness-may-help-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-stroke-8714853" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;risk factor for heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Blood pressure taken while seated remained stable initially, but after two weeks of daily mango intake, certain blood pressure measures after meals improved. For example, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/5-minutes-exercise-blood-pressure-study-8742275" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;systolic blood pressure dropped significantly&lt;/a&gt; compared to the no-mango period, decreasing by 6 mmHg. Diastolic blood pressure also lowered slightly, by 2.7 mmHg. Overall, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mango-benefits-11727631" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;regular mango intake&lt;/a&gt; seemed to positively influence certain aspects of heart health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Two weeks of mango eating was also associated with a drop in cholesterol levels, which decreased by 9 mg/dL. There were short-term changes observed, too: &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/hdl-vs-ldl-cholesterol-whats-the-difference-11678853" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;LDL (bad) cholesterol decreased&lt;/a&gt; by 9.6 mg/dL two hours after eating, but only once mangoes were part of the daily diet for two weeks. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After eating mangoes every day for two weeks, participants’ &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-your-blood-sugar-is-too-low-11746496" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blood sugar levels were noticeably lower&lt;/a&gt; two hours after eating compared to when they hadn’t started the mango routine yet. Specifically, blood sugar dropped by 5 mg/dL two hours after eating, showing a positive change. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Six participants with slightly higher fasting blood sugar levels joined a second trial to explore how their bodies process glucose after eating. The study found that eating white bread caused both a drop in blood pressure and an increase in heart rate, while &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7833638/foods-to-keep-blood-sugar-in-check/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;mango consumption led to lower blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt; compared to white bread. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, insulin levels were highest after eating white bread and stayed elevated longer than after eating mango. Eating mango caused a smaller and shorter insulin response compared to bread, and skipping food entirely led to the lowest insulin levels of all. These results suggest that mango may be a good choice for someone looking to satisfy a sweet tooth while managing their blood sugar levels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It is important to consider certain limitations of this study when interpreting these results. One limitation of this study is the large amount of mango participants ate. Though the 330 grams of mango used in this study was intended to explore the fruit’s potential benefits, it’s worth noting that most people consume much smaller portions. The researchers share that women of childbearing age typically eat about 90 grams of mango daily, and adults over 60 eat around 91 grams. Future studies using these more common portion sizes would be valuable. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another noteworthy limitation of the study is the small sample size. A limited number of participants may reduce the generalizability of the findings and increase the likelihood of statistical anomalies, making it more difficult to draw robust conclusions. Future studies with larger and more diverse participant pools would help validate these results and provide greater insight. Finally, because the study involved postmenopausal women, the findings can’t automatically apply to other groups. And it’s worth considering that this study was funded in part by the National Mango Board.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re a post-menopausal woman dealing with overweight or obesity, here’s some juicy news: &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7899384/mango-spinach-smoothie/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;incorporating mangoes into your diet&lt;/a&gt; might be a delicious step toward better health. Packed with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8007622/vegetables-you-should-be-eating-every-week/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;nutrients like beta carotene, vitamin C and potassium&lt;/a&gt;, mangoes are more than just a fun snack or smoothie ingredient.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; According to this data, they may help regulate blood sugar, lower cholesterol levels and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-for-gut-and-heart-health-8771784" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;support overall heart health&lt;/a&gt;. While the study suggests eating 2 cups daily, you might not need to go all-in to see benefits. Even smaller, consistent portions may make a difference, especially when paired with other healthy habits like regular exercise and a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;balanced, nutrient-rich diet&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether blended into a smoothie, tossed into a salad or simply enjoyed on their own, these golden fruits provide a simple, satisfying way to fuel your body and support overall health. Some simple ways to eat more mangos include:

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pro tip: Frozen, freeze-dried, dried and canned mangoes provide the same nutrients as fresh options, giving you even more choices for including this fruit in your diet. Just be sure to look out for excess added sugar in packaged versions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This recent study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Nutrition Association&lt;/em&gt; showed some intriguing potential benefits of adding mangoes to your diet, particularly if you are in the postmenopausal stage of life. The research found that eating Ataulfo mangoes regularly was linked to reduced blood sugar levels, improved cholesterol markers and lower arterial stiffness after meals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately, this study adds to the growing evidence that mangoes are more than just a delicious tropical fruit; they’re a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290550/10-everyday-superfoods/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nutrient-rich addition to a healthy, balanced diet&lt;/a&gt;. Whether you’re trying to enhance your heart health, manage blood sugar or simply enjoy the natural sweetness of mangoes, these findings make a compelling case for including them in your meal rotation (as if we needed another reason to love them). Just remember to enjoy mangoes as part of a varied, nutrient-dense diet tailored to your specific health goals and lifestyle. After all, the best dietary choices are sustainable, enjoyable and balanced—qualities that mangoes certainly bring to the table!&lt;br&gt;

Scientists want those later decades to feel less like overtime and more like prime time, so they are probing ways to postpone the biological slide that usually accelerates after age 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One avenue getting serious attention swaps crash diets for chemistry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/can-caloric-restriction-help-you-live-longer-its-complicated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cutting calories&lt;/a&gt; without malnutrition stretches the life of mice, worms, and even rhesus monkeys, but sticking to that routine is tough and can cause dizziness, brittle bones, and hair thinning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are hunting for pills that give the same benefits while letting dinner stay on the plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-importance-of-aging-research"&gt;Importance of aging research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aging drives most top killers – &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/morning-coffee-drinkers-have-a-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-scientist-discovers-that-common-non-cancer-drugs-when-combined-can-kill-cancer-cells/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dementia-was-extremely-rare-in-ancient-times-so-why-is-it-now-so-prevalent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; – by pushing cells toward dysfunction. Delaying the underlying process could reduce the burden of several conditions at once instead of treating each separately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health economists note that trimming even a few years off late-life disability would save billions in care costs and lift quality of life for millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most drug discovery still targets single diseases, yet a growing field called geroscience treats aging itself as the root cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caloric-restriction mimetics, or CRMs, sit high on the wish list because they tap into &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/intermittent-fasting-slows-aging-by-boosting-cell-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolic circuits&lt;/a&gt; that animals already use to survive lean times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When those circuits turn on, cells tidy up damaged proteins, improve energy use, and bolster stress defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-caloric-restriction-and-its-hurdles"&gt;Caloric restriction and its hurdles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dietary-restriction-slows-brain-aging-and-increases-lifespan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;caloric restriction&lt;/a&gt; usually means eating 20–40 percent fewer calories than normal for years on end. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence in rodents is striking, but people find the regimen unsustainable, and severe energy cuts can weaken immunity. A safer strategy aims to flip the same molecular switches with medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computational screening tools now search drug libraries for compounds that make human cells mimic the gene-expression profile seen under calorie shortfall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach is faster than testing each molecule in live animals first and often highlights drugs already approved for other conditions, cutting years off the path to clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rilmenidine-common-pill-fights-aging"&gt;Rilmenidine – common pill fights aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One surprising hit from these searches is rilmenidine, a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/rilmenidine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hypertension medicine&lt;/a&gt; taken by mouth for three decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After machine-learning models flagged it, a team led by molecular biogerontologist João Pedro Magalhães at the &lt;a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Birmingham UK&lt;/a&gt; put it to the test in &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt;, a small soil worm favored by aging researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the first time, we have been able to show in animals that rilmenidine can increase lifespan,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same trial delivered another bonus: older worms benefited almost as much as young ones, hinting that humans would not need to start treatment in middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug’s safety record also helps. Doctors prescribe rilmenidine worldwide for high blood pressure, and side effects are rare and relatively mild: they include palpitations, insomnia, and drowsiness in a few cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Magalhães noted, “We are now keen to explore if rilmenidine may have other clinical applications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-rilmenidine-acts-inside-cells"&gt;How rilmenidine acts inside cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rilmenidine binds to imidazoline receptors, tiny docking stations on cell membranes that regulate metabolism. In worms, one receptor called &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Characterization-of-NISH-1_fig1_355334171" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nish-1&lt;/a&gt; turned out to be essential. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that the lifespan-extending effects of rilmenidine were abolished when nish-1 was deleted,” the research team explained. They then re-introduced the receptor gene. Rescuing the nish-1 receptor reinstated the increase in lifespan after treatment with rilmenidine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those findings outline a clear pathway for future drug tweaks aimed at boosting potency or reducing any unwanted effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downstream from nish-1, the treated worms ramped up autophagy – the cell’s waste-disposal system – and tolerated heat stress better than untreated peers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither developmental timing nor fertility shifted, suggesting the drug targeted aging pathways rather than growth or reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-testing-across-species"&gt;Testing across species&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/rna-junk-is-crucial-for-human-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shares many genes&lt;/a&gt; with humans, yet researchers need data from mammals before moving to people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Birmingham group therefore fed rilmenidine to mice and saw gene-expression changes in liver and kidney tissue that matched the classic caloric-restriction signature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood biomarkers of metabolism shifted toward youthful levels, reinforcing the idea that the pill taps into ancient survival programs conserved across species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the compound is already approved, early-phase human trials could focus directly on biological markers such as &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-loss-has-a-greater-impact-on-heart-health-than-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;inflammatory proteins&lt;/a&gt;, insulin sensitivity, and muscle strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rilmenidine’s oral delivery is a practical advantage over drugs that require injections or special diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-of-rilmenidine-and-anti-aging"&gt;Future of rilmenidine and anti-aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longer human studies must still rule out subtle harms and confirm that improved markers translate into healthier years. Even so, experts see momentum building. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With a global aging population, the benefits of delaying aging – even if slightly – are immense,” Magalhães said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators will need fresh guidelines for drugs that target aging rather than a diagnosed disease, and ethicists are debating fair access. Yet the prospect of taking a small daily tablet instead of counting every calorie is hard to ignore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If rilmenidine or similar compounds keep proving safe and effective, the next generation of seniors may find that staying healthy deep into their eighties feels less like luck and more like routine science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.13774" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Aging Cell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 22:46:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQR1FveUFHRGozV2FrcTBKNURmRDRwdmlMMWpBaU1Ockw3VnNRWlBTS28xSnhlRkZVQTN3ZFUzZWNVOXFYT2QwTm1zOElqWndNNHN2RDI1NGlhYTZEVEowRXRuT3BkSkZkRXhJeFNsZi1FWFgxcjBIMVFrLU9jMFE0UkJDRk44WnBZQ0FhdG9UUEQ3R05IMHVNd1hkNTZiUXE1VnVURGpRNUt4Tm9PX3RoVUV3</guid></item><item><title>每周一次的精神分裂症药丸在临床试验中显示出前景-麻省理工学院新闻 | Once-a-week pill for schizophrenia shows promise in clinical trials - MIT News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxQYWJQRTAzSGNwdDcwY0dVbjNBUU5WeU1ZT1ZBTGt1dE85cjhDUTVWY016OUwwUlczNU1iaVpaSGJEazVuNXAxQk9TajRKV2Rib05ZQ3p2Ul83LTl2Q29TM1FvaHM4T09mYlhNWF9iWGFlNUJZN2lnRmZ1T0l4VWRaTmJRNlJ2SEpxWVdJdTllZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph paragraph--type--content-block-text paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          

            &lt;p&gt;For many patients with schizophrenia, other psychiatric illnesses, or diseases such as hypertension and asthma, it can be difficult to take their medicine every day. To help overcome that challenge, MIT researchers have developed a pill that can be taken just once a week and gradually releases medication from within the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a phase 3 clinical trial conducted by MIT spinout Lyndra Therapeutics, the researchers used the once-a-week pill to deliver a widely used medication for managing the symptoms of schizophrenia. They found that this treatment regimen maintained consistent levels of the drug in patients’ bodies and controlled their symptoms just as well as daily doses of the drug. The results are published today in &lt;em&gt;Lancet Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve converted something that has to be taken once a day to once a week, orally, using a technology that can be adapted for a variety of medications,” says Giovanni Traverso, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT, a gastroenterologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, an associate member of the Broad Institute, and an author of the study. “The ability to provide a sustained level of drug for a prolonged period, in an easy-to-administer system, makes it easier to ensure patients are receiving their medication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traverso’s lab began developing the ingestible capsule studied in this trial more than 10 years ago, as part of an ongoing effort to make medications easier for patients to take. The capsule is about the size of a multivitamin, and once swallowed, it expands into a star shape that helps it remain in the stomach until all of the drug is released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Scranton, chief medical officer of Lyndra Therapeutics, is the senior author of the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(25)00135-X/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, and Leslie Citrome, a clinical professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at New York Medical College School of Medicine, is the lead author. Nayana Nagaraj, medical director at Lyndra Therapeutics, and Todd Dumas, senior director of pharmacometrics at Certara, are also authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustained delivery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, Traverso’s lab has been working on a variety of capsules that can be swallowed and remain in the digestive tract for days or weeks, slowly releasing their drug payload. In 2016, his team reported the &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2016/new-capsule-long-term-drug-delivery-malaria-1116" target="_blank"&gt;star-shaped device&lt;/a&gt;, which was then further developed by Lyndra for clinical trials in patients with schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device contains six arms that can be folded in, allowing it to fit inside a capsule. The capsule dissolves when the device reaches the stomach, allowing the arms to spring out. Once the arms are extended, the device becomes too large to pass through the pylorus (the exit of the stomach), so it remains freely floating in the stomach as drugs are slowly released from the arms. After about a week, the arms break off on their own, and each segment exits the stomach and passes through the digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the clinical trials, the capsule was loaded with risperidone, a commonly prescribed medication used to treat schizophrenia. Most patients take the drug orally once a day. There are also injectable versions that can be given every two weeks, every month, or every two months, but they require administration by a health care provider and are not always acceptable to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT and Lyndra team chose to focus on schizophrenia in hopes that a drug regimen that could be administered less frequently, through oral delivery, could make treatment easier for patients and their caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the areas of unmet need that was recognized early on is neuropsychiatric conditions, where the illness can limit or impair one’s ability to remember to take their medication,” Traverso says. “With that in mind, one of the conditions that has been a big focus has been schizophrenia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phase 3 trial was coordinated by researchers at Lyndra and enrolled 83 patients at five different sites around the United States. Forty-five of those patients completed the full five weeks of the study, in which they took one risperidone-loaded capsule per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the study, the researchers measured the amount of drug in each patient’s bloodstream. Each week, they found a sharp increase on the day the pill was given, followed by a slow decline over the next week. The levels were all within the optimal range, and there was less variation over time than is seen when patients take a pill each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effective treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an evaluation known as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the researchers also found that the patients’ symptoms remained stable throughout the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the biggest obstacles in the care of people with chronic illnesses in general is that medications are not taken consistently. This leads to worsening symptoms, and in the case of schizophrenia, potential relapse and hospitalization,” Citrome says. “Having the option to take medication by mouth once a week represents an important option that can assist with adherence for the many patients who would prefer oral medications versus injectable formulations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side effects from the treatment were minimal, the researchers found. Some patients experienced mild acid reflux and constipation early in the study, but these did not last long. The results, showing effectiveness of the capsule and few side effects, represent a major milestone in this approach to drug delivery, Traverso says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This really demonstrates that what we had hypothesized a decade ago, which is that a single capsule providing a drug depot within the GI tract could be possible,” he says. “Here what you see is that the capsule can achieve the drug levels that were predicted, and also control symptoms in a sizeable cohort of patients with schizophrenia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators now hope to complete larger phase 3 studies before applying for FDA approval of this delivery approach for risperidone. They are also preparing for phase 1 trials using this capsule to deliver other drugs, including contraceptives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are delighted that this technology which started at MIT has reached the point of phase 3 clinical trials,” says Robert Langer, the David H. Koch Institute Professor at MIT, who was an author of the original study on the star capsule and is a co-founder of Lyndra Therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by Lyndra Therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the billions of neurons in the brain, fewer than 500 are responsible for suppressing binge drinking, according to new research by Gilles E. Martin, Ph.D., associate professor of neurobiology.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;i&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;, these &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01970-x" target="_blank"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; provide insights into binge-drinking behavior and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/alcohol+dependency/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;alcohol dependency&lt;/a&gt; that may lead to new therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's really hard to comprehend how only a few neurons can have such a profound effect on behavior," said Dr. Martin, a member of the Brudnick Neuropsychiatric Research Institute at UMass Chan. "This is exciting because we are starting to understand how only a handful of cells are involved in very specific behaviors. Truly, this study is about finding a needle in a haystack."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol addiction and overconsumption constitute a significant health challenge, causing millions of deaths both directly and indirectly through more than 200 associated diseases and injuries resulting from short- and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/long-term+use/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;long-term use&lt;/a&gt;. While recent studies have highlighted specific areas of the brain such as the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/prefrontal+cortex/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt; as playing a role in inhibiting overconsumption of alcohol, these studies have lacked the resolution to pinpoint the specific neuronal circuits involved with suppressing &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/alcohol+consumption/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Martin and colleagues were able to narrow down the area in the brain responsible for suppressing binge drinking to a specific neuronal ensemble by using a combination of advanced fiber photometry, optogenetics, electrophysiology and single cell transcriptomics technologies with a viral vector approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The golden age of neuroscience we entered a decade ago is now accelerating," explained Martin. "With all the tools available to us, we are now able to do things that 10 or even five years ago were unimaginable. There are billions of neurons in the brain. Without these technologies, we wouldn't be able to detect this activity among all those cells. It would fly under the radar because there would be so few cells active, we wouldn't be able to see them."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A discrete group of co-activated neurons, neural ensembles represent the basic units of neuronal code in the brain. These small neural groups function in coordinated and recurring patterns, firing together to create a distinct pattern of activity, often in response to specific stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a special mouse model designed for labeling and manipulating neurons that are activated during a defined time frame, Martin and colleagues were able to identify a small group of neurons activated in response to binge drinking events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When neurons are activated in these animal models, they emit an extremely bright fluorescent protein that can be seen using fiber photometry technologies. Because this happens in real time, scientists can pinpoint the precise neurons that fire when the animal is exposed to a stimulus. Then, using optogenetic techniques that employ light to activate cells safely in living animals, these neurons can be turned on and off, like a switch. This allows scientists to observe potential behavioral changes and link those changes to specific neurons in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We know that in some cases binge drinking can lead to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/alcohol+dependence/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;alcohol dependence&lt;/a&gt;," explained Martin. "This area of the brain appears to be intimately involved with suppressing that behavior. It could be that misfiring in this mechanism is involved in alcohol dependence and reactivating it could be a potential target for therapeutics."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As technology continues to advance and it becomes possible to observe even small subsets of neurons, Martin believes that there may be as few as two or three dozen &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neurons/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neurons&lt;/a&gt; responsible for suppressing binge drinking and knowing what they are might be a critical step toward developing targeted therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officials announced Tuesday that preliminary results of water tests indicated the presence of legionella in the water system at the Mohnton facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legionnaires’ disease is a type of severe pneumonia that can prove fatal for about 10% of people infected, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As well as pneumonia symptoms, it can cause diarrhea, nausea and confusion among those infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of an abundance of caution, they have taken the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• County workers at the South Campus have been dismissed for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• The Facilities Department has ordered portable bathrooms and an enclosed, potable drinking water and utility water supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• All access to water and bathrooms in the building is being restricted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to advised protocols, officials said the building can be occupied safely while these alternative measures for bathroom and water access are in place.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;The South Campus will be closed while the water system is chlorinated over the weekend. The departments and agencies affected include planning, assessment, mapping, community and economic development, archives, the workforce development board, the industrial development authority, the area agency of aging, the Berks County Book Bonanza and the offices of District Judge David Yoch.&lt;/p&gt;

Obviously, one in the fall to prevent the winter increase, but another right now in order to help prevent serious disease during the late summer and early fall,” Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;This goes for people 65 and older, younger people with underlying chronic medical conditions and pregnant people, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;“The recommendation is take special precautions and get that extra dose, because if we get infected ... we get that extra protection and to help keep us out of the hospital,” Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Wearing a mask in indoor spaces, social distancing, washing your hands often and increasing ventilation when possible are more ways to protect yourself from COVID and other respiratory viruses, too, said Burns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you do get sick, there are treatments available.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative col-body mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-[0.875rem]/[1.25rem] mt-1  line-clamp-2 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Oleg Breslavtsev / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;If you have any COVID symptoms, such as sore throat, fatigue, cough or fever, take a test to see if you have COVID. If you are infected, get in touch with your doctor, particularly if you’re high-risk as there are treatments available, said Schaffner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;It’s important that you talk to your primary care provider as the guidance will vary depending on your age, underlying conditions and other risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;COVID is a miserable infection, Horn added. “Over-the-counter meds help — Ibuprofen alternating with Tylenol, if you’re able to take those ... there’s no reason to be miserable,” Horn said. “So, take the medicine that you are able to take to help,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;It’s also important to stay hydrated when you’re sick even if you do have a painful sore throat. A sore throat can make hydration feel like more of a chore, but it’s important to drink water and herbal teas as dehydration can further irritate the dry membranes in your throat, Horn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;“If you are sick, it’s best to keep your germs to yourself,” said Horn. This means canceling the dinner plans, not going to the party and calling out of work if you can — if you can’t, wearing a tight-fitting mask is key, Horn added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;“Preventing transmission is the biggest thing that we can do to help keep everybody healthy,” Horn said.&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/razor-sore-throat-painful-covid-symptom_l_6846f28ee4b0bf9944bd1061" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HuffPost.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/fabianabuontempo/things-women-do-that-make-men-feel-giddy?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:&amp;quot;It's Nice To Feel Wanted&amp;quot;: Guys Are Sharing The Small Gestures Women Do That Make Them Weak At The Knees;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;"It's Nice To Feel Wanted": Guys Are Sharing The Small Gestures Women Do That Make Them Weak At The Knees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/hannahloewentheil/modern-trends-that-should-disappear?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:&amp;quot;I Can't Wait For This To Go Out Of Style&amp;quot;: People Are Sharing Popular Modern Trends That Are Actually Pretty Toxic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;"I Can't Wait For This To Go Out Of Style": People Are Sharing Popular Modern Trends That Are Actually Pretty Toxic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/rachelblatt/love-life-died-signs-medium-essay?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I Was Devastated When The Love Of My Life Died.
