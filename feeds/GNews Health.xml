On the ambulance ride, though, Minka’s condition took a turn for the worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of her eyes closed entirely, the other rolled back, and her tongue twitched uncontrollably, according to her mother. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time they reached the hospital, Minka, from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/maryland/index.html" id="mol-7bbe4b90-0039-11f0-b928-1b9facf74249"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, had stopped breathing, her mother remembered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After her death the family learned the little girl had suffered &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14447909/Doctors-sound-alarm-children-die-frightening-brain-rotting-condition.html"&gt;severe brain inflammation caused by the flu &lt;/a&gt;that has killed more children than usual this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ten-year-old Minka Aisha Greene of Maryland died from flu-related encephalitis after multiple hospital visits, where doctors initially dismissed her illness as routine flu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Minka's mother said doctors didn't investigate Minka's condition further and urged others to press doctors to conduct more tests, such as an MRI or chest X-ray, to ensure it's not something more serious before sending the child home&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US is in the midst of a protracted &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-a6a80350-0039-11f0-b928-1b9facf74249" class=""&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; epidemic that has killed 13,000 people this season, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13354909/boy-dies-flu-infection-sepsis-maryland.html"&gt;including at least&lt;/a&gt; 60 children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Minka’s story of being dismissed at the emergency department is not unique. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other grieving parents have described similar experiences, including that of nine-year-old Alex Doom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically, the flu causes fever or chills, cough, body and headaches, and fatigue. In some cases, flu may give way to &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/pneumonia/index.html" id="mol-d03684c0-0021-11f0-90fe-f39ae02c6785"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;, a potentially fatal condition in which the infection spreads to the lungs and fills it with fluid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Flu can also lead to sepsis – when the infection enters the blood – and respiratory failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-d02e6e70-0021-11f0-90fe-f39ae02c6785"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; recently revealed that nine children have died of IAE, or brain inflammation that can cause delirium, seizures, and, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14142023/Boy-dies-just-days-showing-signs-common-flu-symptom.html"&gt;in some cases, death&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 13 percent of child flu deaths attributed to IAE this season is slightly above average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alex Doom &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.staabfuneralhomes.com/obituaries/Alex-Doom?obId=34258591"&gt;passed away in December&lt;/a&gt;, two days after being sent home from the emergency department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His mother had taken him to urgent care on December 23, where he was diagnosed with the flu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors gave him Tamiflu, the antiviral medication, and sent them on their way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family spent Christmas morning in the emergency room at a Sherman, Illinois hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alex had a high fever and an elevated heart rate, but he was still allowed to go home and ‘let it pass.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The next day, he became limp, stopped responding to people, and his eyes rolled back into his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alex Doom, right, shown with his brother, passed away in December, two days after being sent home from the emergency department. He was diagnosed with sepsis after being airlifted to a larger hospital, and died hours later&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At that same ER, doctors diagnosed him with severe sepsis, and he had to be connected to a breathing machine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Soon after, he lost his pulse, and doctors performed CPR for several minutes until he regained consciousness. But he would not recover. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After air-lifting him to a hospital in St Louis, where he was on life support, his body deteriorated so much that life-sustaining measures were no longer effective.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Alex was a wonderful kid who touched the lives of those around him,’ his parents said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If you ever met Alex, then you know he had the biggest smile ever! Alex had a heart of gold and was loved by so many.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alex’s case echoes that of a Boston police detective, Mark Walsh, 51, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-mark-and-family-through-crisis"&gt;who died&lt;/a&gt; last month from sepsis after contracting the flu and suffered trauma to his heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When he arrived at the hospital with chest pains, doctors said he had endured a ‘cardiac event,’ which does not necessarily mean a heart attack, though the family was not more specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was deemed to be in stable condition at the hospital when he began exhibiting signs of sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mark Walsh, 51, [right] died last month from sepsis after the flu and heart trauma. He was initially stable after arriving with chest pains but soon showed signs of sepsis. Mark loved grilling, golf, and his wife and two sons, John Daniel and Connor William [pictured]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nine-year-old Madeline Vernon from North Carolina died after developing a 104.9°F fever after initially being sent home, with doctors chalking her symptoms up to normal flu infection. She was later placed on a ventilator and passed away hours later&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mark loved grilling for his friends, sports – especially golf – and his wife and two sons, John Daniel and Connor William.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just a few weeks prior, nine-year-old Madeline Vernon from North Carolina &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14406077/girl-dies-flu-fever-season-intense-decade.html"&gt;died after&lt;/a&gt; developing a 104.9F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She had gone to urgent care a few days before, where she was diagnosed with the flu and sent home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A few days later, she was rushed back to urgent care, placed on a ventilator to help her breathe, and transported to Brenner's Children's Hospital in Winston-Salem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She passed away hours later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I literally feel like my heart has been ripped in half. I literally lost a piece of me,’ her mother said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, and Connecticut had the highest flu activity. The five states with the lowest flu activity as of February 2025 are Alaska, Hawaii, West Virginia, Montana, and Wyoming&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Madeline hadn’t gotten a flu shot this year; neither had Minka. It’s unclear whether Mark had gotten vaccinated, though with a state flu vaccination rate of 84 percent, most Massachusetts residents are protected from severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s also unclear whether Alex had been vaccinated before getting sick, but vaccination rates in Illinois are low, with around 28 percent of residents being fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Historically, flu vaccine effectiveness varies annually, typically ranging from 40 percent to 60 percent. This year’s is believed to be about 35 percent effective at preventing hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That 35 percent, which may seem low to some, is still high enough for doctors and public health officials to urge the public to vaccinate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 17:56:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNa2RPVVlMNHNoSGdtUlNjUGZYOVdmcUVXQkJWRklyR1RjNDhoZXhCZVFSRV9wMzBYZTROTlJ5aktIcy02a0RhUGxLR3dvRmQ5VVpFYkd2OTZnazRWZjMxM2FWczFOa1VGcWRFTzRaeFlJQnBRbGhOa2s1eXloUGRKYTRMelJsUUFa0gGOAUFVX3lxTFBtdE1EZlBpMlZxVW1IdVRRLTNzVUpORUV6WGgwcU9Eb0NYNS1NSUhQRTlWWF9QcFVsSnQ0TW8wNHFTQ3JVYzFxZkdIYTZEYlNNelVRYXNDWjdtT192LU90N3VjUlZ1Z01YYkRiRTZoaWIzS0s1WjlvQzFrSGxSeE1SS0RMOS1mYTQ3WjRMN2c</guid></item><item><title>Public Health Survived the Pandemic.

Then came a deadly measles outbreak in neighboring Texas. The number of Louisiana schoolchildren with exemptions to vaccine requirements doubled &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.axios.com/local/new-orleans/2024/09/06/kindergarten-vaccine-exemption-louisiana-increase" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;in a year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;During the Covid pandemic, Dr. Avegno worked with state officials to tame high infection rates and promote vaccines. But after taking office last year, Gov. Jeff Landry began carrying out a promise to remake public health after the state’s Covid response, which he thought was a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Mr. Landry, a Republican, created a position for a state surgeon general, appointing Dr. Ralph Abraham, a former congressman who had &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nola.com/news/politics/louisiana-surgeon-general-blasts-states-past-covid-response/article_64153d82-7c40-11ef-8ed4-07b880ad2d8d.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;railed against the state’s “tyrannical” Covid response&lt;/a&gt; and argued that the real risk was not the virus itself but the vaccines against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;So it was not entirely a surprise when Dr. Abraham announced last month that Louisiana would “no longer promote mass vaccination,” &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://ldh.la.gov/news/7478" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;calling efforts to do so during Covid&lt;/a&gt; “an offense against personal autonomy that would take years to overcome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;To Dr. Avegno, it was a blunt reminder of how the political aftereffects of the pandemic have left her field worse prepared in many ways to fight the next one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“We’re in a very different world right now,” she said. “We are now prepared to throw the baby out with the bath water and leave ourselves incredibly vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

waking up in the middle of the night&lt;/a&gt; - maybe at 2am or 3am?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Do you find yourself doing this every night?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some may believe this has something to do with the 'witching hour,' &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.mattressnextday.co.uk/mattresses"&gt;MattressNextDay&lt;/a&gt; sleep expert Martin Seeley explains that it has a lot more to do with your diet and stress levels than anything else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explains that stress and anxiety are most likely the culprits behind your body waking you up in the middle of the night often. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even if you might believe that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14083591/suprising-subtle-signs-high-functioning-anxiety-symptoms.html"&gt;you're not a very anxious person&lt;/a&gt;, your body may be telling a different story. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Your brain processes emotions while you sleep, so if you're carrying any stress, even subconsciously, your body might jolt you awake as it tries to deal with it' Seeley says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And like many other things, your diet is probably also playing a huge part. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seeley explains that blood sugar dips may be the reason you're randomly waking up in the middle of your sleep.  &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sleep expert Martin Seeley suggests swapping out sugary late night snacks for healthier proteins and fats (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'If you're eating a lot of refined carbs or sugary foods before bed, your blood sugar can spike and then crash in the middle of the night, waking you up,' he says. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;To avoid this, try cutting out whatever sugary snacks you might be consuming before bed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Instead, Seeley suggests something that's a small serving of protein with healthy fats - like a handful of nuts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'These can help keep your blood sugar stable through the night,' he says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you're someone who indulges in alcohol or can't get through the day without your cup of coffee, Seeley has some bad news for you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Alcohol can also be a sneaky culprit, as while a glass of wine might help you doze off, it disrupts your sleep cycle and often leads to you waking up in the middle of the night,' he says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And as for coffee, it may be a good idea to reduce your caffeine intake, especially in the afternoon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Seeley explains that even those who aren't sensitive to caffeine can feel the effects of it lingering in their system for hours, which can eventually affect their ability to sleep. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Seeley says if you can't fall asleep after waking up, sometimes getting out of bed and making yourself tired can help (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And if nothing else is working, you can try tweaking your bedtime routine to make sure you're destressing as much as possible before bed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Seeley suggests winding down with an activity that's relaxing for you, like 'reading a book, stretching, or practicing deep breathing exercises.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;You also want to make sure that you're keeping as consistent of a sleep schedule as possible - yes, even on the weekends. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This, he explains, will regulate your body's internal clock and send a signal to your brain that bedtime is when it's time to settle down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;He also advises to pay attention to your sleep environment.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;A cool, dark, and quiet bedroom is key, with blackout curtains, white noise machines, and breathable bedding able to make a huge difference,' he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And if you do find yourself waking up in the middle of the night without being able to fall back asleep, it's important to remain calm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seeley suggests avoiding your phone or checking the time, because this can trigger stress and make it harder to fall asleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The second you wake up and can't fall back asleep, try deep breathing or meditation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And if that doesn't work, Seeley actually suggests getting out of bed and something something calming (but in a dim light) until you feel yourself getting sleepy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Lying there restless will only encourage your brain to associate your bed with somewhere it doesn't get rest, so hop out of bed and get back in when you feel ready to sleep again,' he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Kownacki)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the research team each examined more than 1,300 raw CT image slices of the mummy produced in 2015 to determine whether there was any radiological evidence of a pregnancy or of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every expert who reanalyzed the CT scans concluded that there was no fetus and that the material assumed to be a fetus was actually part of the embalming process. Further, the suggestion that the fetus' skeleton and soft tissue did not show up on the scans because the body was "pickled" is impossible, the researchers noted in the study, because acids within the human body are insufficient to dissolve bone, especially after a body is embalmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, none of the experts on the new study could identify clear evidence of cancer in the mummy. Some suggested instead that the damage to the woman's skull most likely occurred when her brain was removed during the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/mummification.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/mummification.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;embalming process&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the diagnostic consensus of the international panel of experts, the researchers concluded in the study that "this should resolve once and for all the discussion of the first alleged case of pregnancy identified inside an ancient Egyptian mummy, as well as the dispute about the presence of nasopharyngeal cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But given the public's intense interest in the "case of the pregnant mummy" over the past four years, the researchers suggested that, going forward, additional focus should be given to questions of maternal and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/ancient-egyptians/ancient-egyptian-children-were-plagued-with-blood-disorders-mummies-reveal" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/ancient-egyptians/ancient-egyptian-children-were-plagued-with-blood-disorders-mummies-reveal"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pediatric health in ancient Egypt&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 id="mummy-quiz-can-you-unwrap-these-ancient-egyptian-mysteries-3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/ancient-egyptians/mummy-quiz-can-you-unwrap-these-ancient-egyptian-mysteries" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/ancient-egyptians/mummy-quiz-can-you-unwrap-these-ancient-egyptian-mysteries"&gt;Mummy quiz&lt;/a&gt;: Can you unwrap these ancient Egyptian mysteries?&lt;/h2&gt;

With about two hours left in the 13-hour flight, the 33-year-old got up for the first time to use the bathroom when she suffered a life-threatening medical emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was waiting for the bathroom and I got this really deep dull aching pain in my chest out of nowhere,” she recalled in a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@alwayssingingmom/video/7476535730894867719" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TikTok;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; video. “I coughed three times and that was the last thing I remember.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emily said she collapsed and hit her head, causing a black eye and bruised arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was unconscious for five minutes,” she said. “I had a near-death experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people.com/woman-30-dies-after-blood-clot-symptoms-were-dismissed-8606693" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Woman, 30, Dies After Blood Clot Symptoms Were Dismissed Twice as 'Long COVID and Anxiety';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Woman, 30, Dies After Blood Clot Symptoms Were Dismissed Twice as 'Long COVID and Anxiety'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Thank God there was a doctor on board and some very amazing, competent flight attendants who essentially saved my life,” she continued. “They gave me an oxygen tank, carried me to business class, laid me down. I was vomiting profusely, sweating.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mom of two said she suffered a “massive bilateral saddle pulmonary embolism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Emily Jansson&lt;/p&gt; Emily Jansson&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A saddle pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs when "a large blood clot gets stuck where the main pulmonary artery branches off into a Y-shape to go into each lung," according to &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/saddle-pulmonary-embolism#definition" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Healthline;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Healthline&lt;/a&gt;. Saddle pulmonary embolisms only comprise two to five percent of all PE cases. The symptoms of the condition include chest pain, difficulty breathing, low blood pressure and irregular heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saddle PE requires immediate medical intervention. If left untreated, it can result in heart failure and sudden death. The condition is associated with a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3718593/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:significant mortality rate;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;significant mortality rate&lt;/a&gt; as high as 30%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Emily Jansson&lt;/p&gt; Emily Jansson&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the flight landed a couple hours later, Emily was taken to the airport clinic for three hours and then transported to Rashid Hospital in Dubai where scans and blood tests were done to diagnose her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to how long it took Emily to get to the hospital, doctors told her that “it was essentially a miracle that I'm still alive.” She was hospitalized for six days undergoing treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people.com/lauren-boebert-undergoes-surgery-for-blood-clot-in-her-leg-8624015" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Boebert Undergoes Surgery for Blood Clot in Her Leg: ‘Looking Forward to Making a Full Recovery’;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lauren Boebert Undergoes Surgery for Blood Clot in Her Leg: ‘Looking Forward to Making a Full Recovery’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emily later learned that a number of factors were “detrimental” to her health during the flight. She said doctors attributed her PE to her not moving during the lengthy flight and wearing compression stockings that cut off blood flow. Taking estrogen birth control could have also contributed, she said, because it can lead to an increased risk of blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, that’s how I almost died,” she said in the clip. “I’m speaking out about it to be transparent and also hopefully educate people about the risks of blood clots and just as a reminder that life is so precious and to just really appreciate it. It sounds so cliché but I just have this new outlook on life now.

All but one of those people were vaccinated, Grace Kelly-McGovern, a Suffolk County health department spokesperson, said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One person who was exposed was a child too young to be vaccinated and has been quarantined, Kelly-McGovern said. She added that the child who was diagnosed with measles was also too young to receive the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/ny-health-officials-urge-measles-vaccinations-for-kids-amid-rise-in-cases" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;third case of measles reported in New York&lt;/a&gt; this year as outbreaks rage in Texas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we follow this case and closely monitor potential exposures, we strongly encourage all residents to protect their health and the health of our youngest and most vulnerable residents by ensuring they are on time and up to date on their measles vaccines and all recommended and lifesaving immunizations,” Dr. Gregson Pigott, Suffolk County commissioner of health services, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that children get the first dose of the MMR vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella between 12 and 15 months and a second dose between the ages of 4 and 6, before starting school. However, only about 81% of children in New York have received their first doses by the age of 2, according to the city and state health departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two New York City infants under 12 months old contracted the virus &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/ny-health-officials-urge-measles-vaccinations-for-kids-amid-rise-in-cases" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; in unrelated cases, the New York City health department said last month. New York City had 14 measles cases last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Jersey also reported three measles cases last month, which may have signaled community spread.

            Are you feeding your children fresh fruit and vegetables, whole grains, fish and plant-based proteins? Parents often think about what foods are healthiest for their little ones.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            But what about what your kids drink? Four leading national health and nutrition organizations &lt;a href="https://healthyeatingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HER_ConsensusStatement_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;recommend you also consider their beverage&lt;/a&gt; intake.

            The &lt;a href="https://healthyeatingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HER_ConsensusStatement_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;consensus statement&lt;/a&gt; summarizes the latest evidence and provides recommendations for healthy beverage intake in school-age children and adolescents. They include total hydration needs by age, the types of beverages that are recommended, those that should be limited, and those that should be avoided.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b0q2m00113b6m2ltjjdh8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They help to answer common questions from parents, such as how much milk should kids drink, whether juice or juice drinks are recommended, and if sports drinks are healthy for children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86ayoaj000y3b6m8v4ad603@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To break down these recommendations, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner and is the mother of two young children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00133b6me53xgoq7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Why is it important to consider what our kids are drinking?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00143b6mm7u2a0xk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;There are several reasons families should care about their kids’ beverage choices, just as they care about their food choices.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00153b6mxr6uv2qr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To start, it’s important that children get most of their calories from nutritious substances rather than so-called empty calories that have little or no nutritional value. Moreover, about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/childhood-obesity-facts/childhood-obesity-facts.html" target="_blank"&gt;1 in 5 children and adolescents&lt;/a&gt; have obesity, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00163b6m2974rwvo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Having a healthy diet is key to reducing obesity and its myriad medical consequences such as diabetes and heart disease. Consumption of sugar-packed sodas and other sugar-sweetened drinks is &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2807548" target="_blank"&gt;strongly associated&lt;/a&gt; with developing overweight and obesity. And these beverages also contribute to &lt;a href="https://penndentalmedicine.org/blog/how-sugary-drinks-affect-teeth/" target="_blank"&gt;tooth decay&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00173b6mwmvofbyn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What kids drink is a key component of their overall diet, so it’s crucial that parents are aware of what products are healthy and recommended — and, equally, what should be avoided. This is not often easy, as some products may be &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/24/health/fda-delays-final-rule-foods-healthy-label"&gt;marketed as healthy&lt;/a&gt; but are not.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00183b6md95aqvjo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How much fluid should school-age kids drink every day?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00193b6melwb32ol@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Hydration needs depends on age. According to &lt;a href="https://healthyeatingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HER_ConsensusStatement_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;the expert panel&lt;/a&gt;, kids 5 to 8 years old should be drinking about 40 fluid ounces a day, which is about 5 cups. Those 9 to 13 years old should drink between 54 to 61 ounces, which is about 7 to 7.5 cups. Those 14 to 18 years old should drink between 61 to 88 ounces, or between 7.5 to 11 cups. These are general estimates, because total hydration needs will vary depending on the child’s size, level of physical activity and climate in which they live.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001a3b6mrdtqqh80@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: I assume that water is the top recommended beverage, right?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001b3b6mrbfafds2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Plain drinking water is just fine, and in fact is the best beverage for school-aged children. The vast majority of your kids’ hydration needs can be met through water alone.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001c3b6mr433jlnw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What about milk and juice?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001d3b6mc8jkwm7y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Let’s take these separately. &lt;a href="https://healthyeatingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HER_ConsensusStatement_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;The experts recommend&lt;/a&gt; plain pasteurized milk — up to 20 fluid ounces a day for 5- to 8-year-olds and up to 24 fluid ounces a day for older children. Note that sweetened-flavored milk (chocolate milk, strawberry milk and so forth) is not recommended due to the high amounts of added sugars per serving.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001e3b6m94akj13o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The limit is a lot lower for juice. &lt;a href="https://healthyeatingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HER_ConsensusStatement_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;According to this panel&lt;/a&gt;, a small amount of 100% juice is OK. And I mean a small amount: less than 4 to 6 ounces per day for 5- to 8-year-olds, less than 6 to 8 ounces for 9- to 13-year-olds, and less than 8 ounces in 14- to 18-year-olds. That means even adolescents should limit their intake of 100% juice to less than 1 cup per day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001f3b6mu4fs9ups@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Regarding juice, these are upper limits, not minimum amounts. Your kids don’t need to drink any juice to have a healthy diet. Children should try to meet their daily fruit recruitment by eating whole fruit, not by drinking juice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001g3b6m60wp46u9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What about soy milk and almond milk? And is there a place for juice drinks that aren’t 100% juice?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001h3b6mey1tvuvj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Plant-based milk alternatives like soy and almond milk are only recommended when there is a specific medical reason — such as an allergy to milk protein or if the child has to have a specific diet. Parents who choose these beverages should look for unsweetened products that do not have sugar or non-sugar sweeteners.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001i3b6mueawagj4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Juice drinks are in the same category as other sugar-sweetened beverages, including sodas. These are not recommended for children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001j3b6mco3rndxm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Are diet drinks OK if they don’t contain sugar?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001k3b6mdmrk66c6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The panel also does not recommend beverages that contain artificial chemical, non-sugar sweeteners. They cite lack of evidence on the safety and impact of these substances on the long-term health among children and adolescents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001l3b6mdok1dniz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How about sports drinks? How can children who participate in after-school and recreational sports keep hydrated?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001m3b6mxqzbaa93@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Sports drinks are not recommended for several reasons. First, many contain high amounts of sugar. Second, they are generally unnecessary. Most people can hydrate sufficiently using water, and they can &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/11/health/sports-drinks-caffeine-children-athletes-wellness/index.html"&gt;replenish lost electrolytes&lt;/a&gt; through food.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86bka9q00213b6mvsixn840@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A third issue to watch out for is that some sports drinks are conflated with energy drinks that contain caffeine and other stimulants. These are not substances that children should be consuming. The expert panel is clear that beverages with caffeine and other stimulants are not recommended for children and adolescents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001o3b6ml55jq7v6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What’s your takeaway from this guidance on drinks, and how will you apply them to your own kids?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001p3b6m9pqrrcvt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; My overall takeaway is that plain drinking water is the best form of hydration. It’s ideal to get kids used to drinking water to replenish their fluids rather than to rely on sweetened substances. Pasteurized milk is also a good source of hydration. While 100% juice can be consumed in small amounts, all other drinks, including flavored milk and juice drinks, should not be part of daily consumption.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001q3b6m67wv7r7n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is generally what my family does. We emphasize water and milk. Juice is a treat — not something we offer every day. If my kids are at a party and there are juice drinks, we will let them drink those, but we tell them it’s a “special occasion” beverage. We do not offer sodas or sports or energy drinks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001r3b6mphcovd0a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, I think the expert panel is right to raise awareness of the importance of healthy drinks, which should be considered just as much as healthy food in forming children’s diets.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Children should consume limited amounts of plain milk daily while avoiding flavored milk containing added sugars.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Juice intake should be restricted to small amounts of 100% juice, with specific upper limits varying by age group.&lt;/li&gt;

            Are you feeding your children fresh fruit and vegetables, whole grains, fish and plant-based proteins? Parents often think about what foods are healthiest for their little ones.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86aykby000v3b6m3d22969v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But what about what your kids drink? Four leading national health and nutrition organizations &lt;a href="https://healthyeatingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HER_ConsensusStatement_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;recommend you also consider their beverage&lt;/a&gt; intake.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm867elqw00003b6mk0r3afip@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://healthyeatingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HER_ConsensusStatement_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;consensus statement&lt;/a&gt; summarizes the latest evidence and provides recommendations for healthy beverage intake in school-age children and adolescents. They include total hydration needs by age, the types of beverages that are recommended, those that should be limited, and those that should be avoided.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b0q2m00113b6m2ltjjdh8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They help to answer common questions from parents, such as how much milk should kids drink, whether juice or juice drinks are recommended, and if sports drinks are healthy for children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86ayoaj000y3b6m8v4ad603@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To break down these recommendations, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner and is the mother of two young children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00133b6me53xgoq7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Why is it important to consider what our kids are drinking?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00143b6mm7u2a0xk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;There are several reasons families should care about their kids’ beverage choices, just as they care about their food choices.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00153b6mxr6uv2qr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To start, it’s important that children get most of their calories from nutritious substances rather than so-called empty calories that have little or no nutritional value. Moreover, about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/childhood-obesity-facts/childhood-obesity-facts.html" target="_blank"&gt;1 in 5 children and adolescents&lt;/a&gt; have obesity, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00163b6m2974rwvo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Having a healthy diet is key to reducing obesity and its myriad medical consequences such as diabetes and heart disease. Consumption of sugar-packed sodas and other sugar-sweetened drinks is &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2807548" target="_blank"&gt;strongly associated&lt;/a&gt; with developing overweight and obesity. And these beverages also contribute to &lt;a href="https://penndentalmedicine.org/blog/how-sugary-drinks-affect-teeth/" target="_blank"&gt;tooth decay&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00173b6mwmvofbyn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What kids drink is a key component of their overall diet, so it’s crucial that parents are aware of what products are healthy and recommended — and, equally, what should be avoided. This is not often easy, as some products may be &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/24/health/fda-delays-final-rule-foods-healthy-label"&gt;marketed as healthy&lt;/a&gt; but are not.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00183b6md95aqvjo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How much fluid should school-age kids drink every day?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d00193b6melwb32ol@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Hydration needs depends on age. According to &lt;a href="https://healthyeatingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HER_ConsensusStatement_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;the expert panel&lt;/a&gt;, kids 5 to 8 years old should be drinking about 40 fluid ounces a day, which is about 5 cups. Those 9 to 13 years old should drink between 54 to 61 ounces, which is about 7 to 7.5 cups. Those 14 to 18 years old should drink between 61 to 88 ounces, or between 7.5 to 11 cups. These are general estimates, because total hydration needs will vary depending on the child’s size, level of physical activity and climate in which they live.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001a3b6mrdtqqh80@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: I assume that water is the top recommended beverage, right?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001b3b6mrbfafds2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Plain drinking water is just fine, and in fact is the best beverage for school-aged children. The vast majority of your kids’ hydration needs can be met through water alone.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001c3b6mr433jlnw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What about milk and juice?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001d3b6mc8jkwm7y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Let’s take these separately. &lt;a href="https://healthyeatingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HER_ConsensusStatement_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;The experts recommend&lt;/a&gt; plain pasteurized milk — up to 20 fluid ounces a day for 5- to 8-year-olds and up to 24 fluid ounces a day for older children. Note that sweetened-flavored milk (chocolate milk, strawberry milk and so forth) is not recommended due to the high amounts of added sugars per serving.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001e3b6m94akj13o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The limit is a lot lower for juice. &lt;a href="https://healthyeatingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HER_ConsensusStatement_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;According to this panel&lt;/a&gt;, a small amount of 100% juice is OK. And I mean a small amount: less than 4 to 6 ounces per day for 5- to 8-year-olds, less than 6 to 8 ounces for 9- to 13-year-olds, and less than 8 ounces in 14- to 18-year-olds. That means even adolescents should limit their intake of 100% juice to less than 1 cup per day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001f3b6mu4fs9ups@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Regarding juice, these are upper limits, not minimum amounts. Your kids don’t need to drink any juice to have a healthy diet. Children should try to meet their daily fruit recruitment by eating whole fruit, not by drinking juice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001g3b6m60wp46u9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What about soy milk and almond milk? And is there a place for juice drinks that aren’t 100% juice?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001h3b6mey1tvuvj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Plant-based milk alternatives like soy and almond milk are only recommended when there is a specific medical reason — such as an allergy to milk protein or if the child has to have a specific diet. Parents who choose these beverages should look for unsweetened products that do not have sugar or non-sugar sweeteners.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001i3b6mueawagj4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Juice drinks are in the same category as other sugar-sweetened beverages, including sodas. These are not recommended for children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001j3b6mco3rndxm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Are diet drinks OK if they don’t contain sugar?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The panel also does not recommend beverages that contain artificial chemical, non-sugar sweeteners. They cite lack of evidence on the safety and impact of these substances on the long-term health among children and adolescents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001l3b6mdok1dniz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How about sports drinks? How can children who participate in after-school and recreational sports keep hydrated?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001m3b6mxqzbaa93@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Sports drinks are not recommended for several reasons. First, many contain high amounts of sugar. Second, they are generally unnecessary. Most people can hydrate sufficiently using water, and they can &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/11/health/sports-drinks-caffeine-children-athletes-wellness/index.html"&gt;replenish lost electrolytes&lt;/a&gt; through food.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86bka9q00213b6mvsixn840@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A third issue to watch out for is that some sports drinks are conflated with energy drinks that contain caffeine and other stimulants. These are not substances that children should be consuming. The expert panel is clear that beverages with caffeine and other stimulants are not recommended for children and adolescents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001o3b6ml55jq7v6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What’s your takeaway from this guidance on drinks, and how will you apply them to your own kids?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001p3b6m9pqrrcvt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; My overall takeaway is that plain drinking water is the best form of hydration. It’s ideal to get kids used to drinking water to replenish their fluids rather than to rely on sweetened substances. Pasteurized milk is also a good source of hydration. While 100% juice can be consumed in small amounts, all other drinks, including flavored milk and juice drinks, should not be part of daily consumption.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001q3b6m67wv7r7n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is generally what my family does. We emphasize water and milk. Juice is a treat — not something we offer every day. If my kids are at a party and there are juice drinks, we will let them drink those, but we tell them it’s a “special occasion” beverage. We do not offer sodas or sports or energy drinks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86b2z3d001r3b6mphcovd0a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, I think the expert panel is right to raise awareness of the importance of healthy drinks, which should be considered just as much as healthy food in forming children’s diets.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rowing and running are undoubtedly some of the most popular forms of cardiovascular exercise. Both activities can send your heart rate through the roof and get your blood pumping, and both have been shown to decrease the risk of developing &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/195439" data-url="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/195439" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;heart disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/ajh/article-abstract/28/2/147/2730195?redirectedFrom=fulltext" data-url="https://academic.oup.com/ajh/article-abstract/28/2/147/2730195?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When it comes to cardiovascular benefits, rowing and running seem to be on equal footing, according to a 2023 study published in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/ehjopen/article/3/3/oead057/7194785" data-url="https://academic.oup.com/ehjopen/article/3/3/oead057/7194785" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;European Heart Journal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is an interesting twist — evidence suggests that elite rowers tend to have notably bigger hearts compared to elite runners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take the landmark 1994 study published in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ajconline.org/article/0002-9149(94)90439-1/abstract" data-url="https://www.ajconline.org/article/0002-9149(94)90439-1/abstract" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Journal of Cardiology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example. One of the biggest of its kind, it investigated structural and functional changes within &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34655-human-heart.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34655-human-heart.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the heart&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of 947 elite athletes representing 27 sports disciplines. Scientists used echocardiography — images of the heart obtained with an ultrasound scan — and found that, of all study participants, rowers had the thickest left ventricular wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the layer of muscle and connecting tissue surrounding the largest chamber of the heart. Rowers also had some of the largest left ventricles during the resting phase between heartbeats, when the heart relaxes and fills with blood. On the other hand, runners did not seem to display such far-reaching changes to their hearts, the study authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Elite rowers tend to have bigger hearts compared to elite runners. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how does rowing affect your heart, and is it different from running?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While both of these activities challenge your cardiovascular system, they do not do so in the same way, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.clinicspots.com/blog/dr.%20bhaskar%20semitha-1" data-url="https://www.clinicspots.com/blog/dr.%20bhaskar%20semitha-1" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Bhaskar Semitha&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist and cardiothoracic surgeon at Fortis Hospital Vashi in Mumbai, India, told Live Science by email. "[This is why] elite rowers tend to have bigger, stronger hearts compared to elite runners, even when they have similar levels of cardiovascular fitness," Semitha said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason lies in the movement itself. Running predominantly &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-muscles-are-used-for-running" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-muscles-are-used-for-running"&gt;&lt;u&gt;targets your legs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Rowing, on the other hand, is a low-impact exercise that simultaneously engages muscles in your legs, core and upper body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rowing is a full-body workout that demands a high oxygen supply, so the heart has to pump more blood per beat," Semitha said. As such, exercising on one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/best-rowing-machines" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/best-rowing-machines"&gt;&lt;u&gt;best rowing machines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; may force your heart to pump blood more efficiently than if you opted for a jog on a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/best-treadmills" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/best-treadmills"&gt;treadmill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over time, this leads to a lower &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/42081-normal-heart-rate.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/42081-normal-heart-rate.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;resting heart rate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a higher stroke volume [the volume of blood pumped from the ventricle per beat.] The heart is working less while delivering more oxygen," Semitha said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This also leads to a significant increase in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-VO2-max" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-VO2-max"&gt;&lt;u&gt;VO2 max&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the maximum amount of oxygen a person can utilize during exercise, which is one of the key markers of performance in cardiovascular exercise. "That's why you will often see rowers with some of the lowest resting heart rates of any athletes," Semitha said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Elite rowers have some of the lowest resting heart rates of any athletes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rowing and running elicit different heart rate responses even if these activities are performed at the same intensity, according to a 2002 study published in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_3086564085750163887&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs00421-002-0599-z&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fexercise%2Fhow-does-rowing-affect-your-heart-and-is-it-different-to-running" data-url="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-002-0599-z" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs00421-002-0599-z&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fexercise%2Fhow-does-rowing-affect-your-heart-and-is-it-different-to-running" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - springer.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;European Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists measured the blood lactate concentration — a biochemical marker of fatigue within exercising muscle — in 55 young, healthy men rowing on a rowing machine and running on a treadmill, and found that their heart rate was consistently lower during rowing even when both these exercises were performed with maximum effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? Again, it is all about the movement. The seated position during rowing makes it easier for blood to flow from the body's lower extremities back to the heart, scientists concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a slight twist to the tale, though. Running, even at moderate intensity, is still more effective than rowing for increasing VO2 max, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.warmbody-coldmind.com/sergii-putsov/" data-url="https://blog.warmbody-coldmind.com/sergii-putsov/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sergii Putsov, PhD&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professional weightlifter, researcher and head of sports science at coaching service Torokhtiy Weightlifting, told Live Science. "Running forces your body to work against gravity, amplifying oxygen consumption and utilization. Since rowing is less weight-bearing than running, its overall ability to increase VO2 max is slightly lower for people who do not push themselves to high intensity," Putsov said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Running forces your body to work against gravity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running also tends to cause more dramatic spikes in heart rate, particularly during high-intensity sprints. "[This is why] running puts more demand on arterial flexibility than rowing," Semitha said. "The repeated impact and fluctuations in intensity force the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/veins-and-arteries" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/veins-and-arteries"&gt;&lt;u&gt;blood vessels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to expand and contract rapidly, which can make arteries more elastic over time and therefore help prevent high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So in the rowing vs running debate, which activity wins for cardiovascular benefits? Neither. Both rowing and running are good exercises for boosting stamina and strengthening the heart muscle, according to Putsov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, their effectiveness may depend on your fitness level, specific goals and physical condition," Putsov said. "The full-body nature of rowing helps improve oxygen utilization efficiently without the harsh repetitive impact associated with running. Running, on the other hand, generates repetitive pounding on your joints and requires relatively high initial energy which can be overwhelming for beginners and people with poor cardiovascular fitness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;Situation at a glance&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p class="don-content"&gt;
            On 13 March 2025, the Ministry of Health of the United Republic of Tanzania declared the end of the Marburg virus disease (MVD) outbreak. This declaration came after two consecutive incubation periods (a total of 42 days) since the last person confirmed with MVD died on 28 January 2025 and was given a safe and dignified burial, in accordance with WHO recommendations. No new confirmed cases were reported since then.

The outbreak was declared on 20 January 2025. As of 12 March 2025, two confirmed and eight probable cases were reported by the Ministry of Health from Biharamulo district in Kagera region. All 10 cases died (case fatality ratio 100%), including eight who died before the confirmation of the outbreak. 

A total of 272 contacts that were listed for monitoring completed their 21-day follow-up as of 10 February 2025.

WHO, through its country office, and partners provided technical, operational and financial support to the government to contain this outbreak. The risk of re-emergence of MVD remains after the official declaration of the end of the outbreak, linked to the animal reservoir’s presence in the country. WHO encourages maintaining early case detection and care capacities in addition to sustaining the ability to quickly respond, and continued risk communication and community engagement.

            &lt;span&gt;Since the last &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON554" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Disease Outbreak News &lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;on this event, published on 14 February 2025, no new confirmed cases of Marburg virus disease (MVD) have been reported in the United Republic of Tanzania.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 12 March 2025, 10 cases have been reported including two confirmed and eight probable cases. All cases resulted in deaths, including eight who died before the confirmation of the outbreak and were classified as probable cases, resulting in a case fatality ratio of 100%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first identified case, an adult female, had symptom onset on 9 December and died on 16 December 2024. The last confirmed case died on 28 January, and a safe and dignified burial was performed. No new confirmed or probable cases have been reported following this burial. All 10 cases were reported from Biharamulo district in Kagera region; the median age of cases was 30 years (range: 1 to 75 years) and the majority of cases (70%, 7) were females. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cumulatively, 108 suspected cases were reported between 20 January and 11 March, of which 106 tested negative for MVD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 12 March 2025, 281 contacts had been listed, including nine who were subsequently classified as probable and confirmed cases and 272 contacts who completed 21 days of follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 13 March 2025, after two consecutive incubation periods (a total of 42 days) without a new confirmed case being reported after the last confirmed case died on 28 January 2025, the Ministry of Health of the United Republic of Tanzania declared the end of the MVD outbreak, as per WHO recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Map of district reporting confirmed and probable Marburg virus disease cases in the United Republic of Tanzania, as of 12 March 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sf-image-responsive="true" src="https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/don-map-mvd-tanzania.png?sfvrsn=44f64167_4" title="DON Map MVD Tanzania" alt="Map for DON MVD in Tanzania" class="-align-center" sf-size="97405"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;Epidemiology&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MVD is a highly virulent disease that can cause severe disease and is clinically similar to Ebola disease (EBOD). EBOD and MVD are caused by orthoebolaviruses and orthomarburgviruses respectively; both are members of the Filoviridae family (filovirus). People become infected after prolonged exposure to mines or caves inhabited by Rousettus fruit bat colonies, a type of fruit bat that can carry the Marburg virus.  Marburg virus then spreads between people via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids. Health workers have previously been infected while treating patients with MVD. Burial ceremonies that involve direct contact with the body of the deceased can also contribute to the transmission of Marburg virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incubation period varies from two to 21 days. Illness caused by the Marburg virus begins abruptly, with a high fever, severe headache, and severe malaise. Severe watery diarrhoea, abdominal pain and cramping, nausea, and vomiting can begin on the third day. Although not all cases present with haemorrhagic signs, severe haemorrhagic manifestations may appear between five and seven days from symptom onset, and fatal cases usually have some form of bleeding, often from multiple areas of the body. In fatal cases, death occurs most often between eight and nine days after symptom onset, usually preceded by severe blood loss and shock. There is currently no approved treatment or vaccine for MVD. Some candidate vaccines and therapeutics are currently under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eighteen outbreaks of MVD have previously been reported globally. The most &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON548" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; outbreak was reported in Rwanda between September and December 2024. Additional countries that previously reported outbreaks of MVD in the African Region include Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, South Africa, and Uganda. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;Public health response&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;ul type="disc"&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;The Ministry of Health developed a national response plan to guide response      activities. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;A National      Incident Management System was activated to coordinate the response to the      event; a national task force was activated, and meetings were held weekly.      At the sub-national level, regular coordination meetings were held daily      in Kagera Region. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;A national rapid response team was deployed to Kagera to enhance outbreak      investigation and response, with technical and operational support from      WHO and health partners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;WHO deployed experts to support the Ministry of Health with Emergency      management and partner coordination, clinical management, health      logistics, infection prevention and control, and other response activities      in different pillars.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Surveillance activities were conducted with active case finding, contact tracing and      mortality surveillance across affected and neighbouring areas. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;The mobile laboratory      deployed in Kabyaile was utilized to support the testing of suspect cases      for rapid turnaround time, and samples were referred to the National Public      Health Laboratory in Dar es Salaam for additional tests.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Travellers departing from the Kagera Region were screened at key points of entry and      exit, including Bukoba airport. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Health and care worker      sensitization sessions on infection prevention and control were conducted across      Kagera and other regions. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;The Marburg Treatment Unit was upgraded with enhanced triage, patient wards,      and donning and doffing areas. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Public awareness campaigns were conducted, including health education,      door-to-door outreach by community health workers, and public      announcements in high-risk areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Cross-border meetings were convened between Tanzania, Uganda, and      Burundi.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;WHO procured and delivered four VHF kits to Kagera region to      support care for patients and infection prevention and control measures.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;p class="don-images d-block d-lg-none"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;WHO risk assessment&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With two confirmed cases and eight probable cases reported, this is the second MVD outbreak reported in the country in the last three years. Both outbreaks occurred in the same region of Kagera located at the border with Rwanda and Uganda.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case fatality ratio of 100% is concerning, although has been recorded in previous outbreaks, additionally 8 of the 10 cases were probable i.e. reported after their death. Late health seeking behaviour in MVD outbreaks increases the risk of further transmission.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source of the outbreak is still unknown, and research activities are planned. Based on the outbreak investigation and surveillance activities during the response, which included contact tracing, alert management, active case search, and mortality surveillance, no additional cases have been reported during the 42-day countdown period. However, there remains a risk of re-emergence of MVD following the declaration of the end of the outbreak, linked to a new spillover from interactions with the animal reservoir. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Based on the available information at the end of MVD outbreak in Tanzania, the risk is considered as moderate&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;at the national level, and low at regional and global levels.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;p class="don-images d-block d-lg-none"&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

    
        &lt;h3 class="don-section"&gt;WHO advice&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;WHO encourages maintaining early detection and care capacities in addition to sustaining the ability to quickly respond after the outbreak ends. This is to make sure that if the disease re-emerges, health authorities can detect it immediately, prevent the disease from spreading again, and ultimately save lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raising awareness of risk factors for Marburg virus infection and protective measures that individuals can take is an effective way to reduce human transmission. WHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce MVD transmission in healthcare facilities and in communities:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reducing the      risk of bat-to-human transmission arising from prolonged exposure to mines      or caves inhabited by fruit bat colonies. People visiting or working in      mines or caves inhabited by fruit bat colonies should wear gloves and      other appropriate protective clothing (including masks).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Capabilities for      early detection of MVD patients should be maintained over time in settings      at risk of the disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reducing the      risk of human-to-human transmission in the community arising from direct      or close contact with infected patients, particularly with their body      fluids. Close physical contact with MVD patients should be avoided.      Patients suspected or confirmed for MVD should be isolated in a designated      treatment centre for early care and to avoid transmission at home.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Communities affected by MVD, along with health authorities, should ensure that the      population is well informed, both about the nature of the disease itself      and about necessary outbreak containment measures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Outbreak containment measures include safe and dignified burial of the deceased,      identifying people who may have been in contact with someone infected with      MVD and monitoring their health for 21 days, separating the healthy from      the sick to prevent further spread and providing care to the confirmed      patient. Maintaining good hygiene and a clean environment need to be      observed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Critical infection prevention and control      measures should be implemented and/or strengthened in all health care      facilities, per &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-WPE-CRS-HCR-2023.1" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;WHO’s Infection prevention and control      guideline for Ebola and Marburg disease&lt;/a&gt;. Health workers caring for patients with      confirmed or suspected MVD should apply &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-UHL-IHS-IPC-2022.2" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;transmission-based precautions&lt;/a&gt; in addition to: &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-UHL-IHS-IPC-2022.1" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;standard precautions&lt;/a&gt;, including appropriate use of PPE and hand      hygiene according to the &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/integrated-health-services-(ihs)/infection-prevention-and-control/your-5-moments-for-hand-hygiene-poster.pdf?sfvrsn=83e2fb0e_21" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;WHO 5 moments&lt;/a&gt; to avoid contact with patient’s blood and      other body fluids and with contaminated surfaces and objects. Waste      generated in healthcare facilities must be safely segregated, collected,      transported, stored, treated and finally disposed. Follow the national guidelines,      rules and regulations for safe waste disposal or follow the &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/85349/9789241548564_eng.pdf;sequence=1" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;WHO’s guidelines on safe waste management&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Patient-care activities should be      undertaken in a clean and hygienic environment that facilitates practices      related to the prevention and control of health-care-associated infections      (HAIs) as outlined in &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241547239" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Essential environmental health standards in      health care&lt;/a&gt;. Safe water, adequate sanitation and hygiene      infrastructure and services should be provided in healthcare facilities.      For details on recommendations and improvement, follow the &lt;a href="https://openwho.org/courses/wash-fit" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;WASH FIT implementation Package&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;WHO encourages countries to implement a      comprehensive care programme to support people who have recovered from MVD      (if any) with any subsequent sequelae and to enable them to access body      fluid testing and to mitigate the risk of transmission through infected      body fluids by adequate practices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the current risk assessment, WHO advises against any travel and trade restrictions with the United Republic of Tanzania.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Canned salmon are the unlikely heroes of an accidental back-of-the-pantry natural history museum, with decades of Alaskan marine ecology preserved in brine and tin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parasites can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parasites-are-actually-vital-for-some-species-survival-study-shows"&gt;tell us a lot&lt;/a&gt; about an ecosystem, because they're usually &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-want-you-to-stop-hating-on-parasites-and-they-ve-got-a-12-step-plan-to-help"&gt;up in the business of several species&lt;/a&gt;. But unless they cause some major problem to humans, historically we &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-we-don-t-know-about-parasites-could-be-disastrous-for-both-us-and-them"&gt;haven't paid them much attention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a problem for parasite ecologists, like Natalie Mastick and Chelsea Wood from the University of Washington, who had been searching for a way to retroactively track the effects parasites had on Pacific Northwestern marine mammals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when Wood got a call from Seattle's Seafood Products Association, asking if she'd be interested in taking boxes of dusty old expired cans of salmon – dating back to the 1970s – off their hands, her answer was, unequivocally, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cans had been set aside for decades as part of the association's quality control process, but i&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIYz3FOsYTU"&gt;n the hands of the ecologists&lt;/a&gt;, they became an archive of excellently preserved specimens; not of salmon, but of worms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xIYz3FOsYTU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the idea of worms in your canned fish is a bit stomach-turning, these roughly 0.4-inch (1-centimeter) long marine parasites, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisakidae"&gt;anisakids&lt;/a&gt;, are harmless to humans when killed during the canning process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Everyone assumes that worms in your salmon is a sign that things have gone awry," &lt;a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2024/04/04/canned-salmon/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Wood when the research was published last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But the anisakid life cycle integrates many components of the food web. I see their presence as a signal that the fish on your plate came from a healthy ecosystem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_123845" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-123845" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/NematodeInSalmon_Body.jpg" alt="A red circle around tweezers grabbing a piece of cooked salmon" class="size-full wp-image-123845" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/NematodeInSalmon_Body.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/NematodeInSalmon_Body-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/NematodeInSalmon_Body-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-123845" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;An anisakid worm (circled in red) in a canned salmon fillet. (Natalie Mastick/University of Washington)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anisakids enter the food web when they are eaten by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krill"&gt;krill&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn are eaten by larger species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how anisakids end up in the salmon, and eventually, the intestines of marine mammals, where the worms complete their life cycle by reproducing. Their eggs are excreted into the ocean by the mammal, and the cycle begins again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If a host is not present – marine mammals, for example – anisakids can't complete their life cycle and their numbers will drop," &lt;a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2024/04/04/canned-salmon/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2024/04/04/canned-salmon/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Wood, the paper's senior author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 178 tin cans in the 'archive' contained four different salmon species caught in the Gulf of Alaska and Bristol Bay across a 42-year period (1979–2021), including 42 cans of chum &lt;em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chum_salmon"&gt;Oncorhynchus keta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;), 22 coho (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coho_salmon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oncorhynchus&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;kisutch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), 62 pink (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_salmon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oncorhynchus&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;gorbuscha&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and 52 sockeye &lt;em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sockeye_salmon"&gt;Oncorhynchus nerka&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the techniques used to preserve the salmon do not, thankfully, keep the worms in pristine condition, the researchers were able to dissect the filets and calculate the number of worms per gram of salmon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_123844" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-123844" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/DegradedNematodeInSalmon_Body.jpg" alt="A brownish worm magnified on a white background" class="size-full wp-image-123844" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/DegradedNematodeInSalmon_Body.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/DegradedNematodeInSalmon_Body-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/DegradedNematodeInSalmon_Body-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-123844" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A highly degraded anisakid found in canned salmon. (&lt;a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2024/04/04/canned-salmon/"&gt;Natalie Mastick/University of Washington&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found worms had increased over time in chum and pink salmon, but not in sockeye or coho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Seeing their numbers rise over time, as we did with pink and chum salmon, indicates that these parasites were able to find all the right hosts and reproduce," &lt;a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2024/04/04/canned-salmon/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Mastick, the paper's lead author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That could indicate a stable or recovering ecosystem, with enough of the right hosts for anisakids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145288" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145288" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ece311043-fig-0001-m-642x352.jpg" alt="Graph showing number of cans from each year that contained each species" class="size-medium wp-image-145288" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ece311043-fig-0001-m-642x352.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ece311043-fig-0001-m-756x415.jpg 756w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ece311043-fig-0001-m-768x422.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ece311043-fig-0001-m-1536x843.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ece311043-fig-0001-m-2048x1124.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ece311043-fig-0001-m-600x329.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145288" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The distribution of canned salmon samples available for each salmon species in each decade. (Mastick et al., &lt;em&gt;Ecology and Evolution&lt;/em&gt;, 2024)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it's harder to explain the stable levels of worms in coho and sockeye, especially since the canning process made it difficult to identify the specific species of anisakid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Though we are confident in our identification to the family level, we could not identify the [anisakids] we detected at the species level," the authors &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.11043"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So it is possible that parasites of an increasing species tend to infect pink and chum salmon, while parasites of a stable species tend to infect coho and sockeye."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastick and colleagues think this novel approach – dusty old cans turned ecological archive – could fuel many more scientific discoveries. It seems they've opened quite a can of worms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.11043"&gt;Ecology and Evolution.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in April 2024&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;hr class="custom-gradient-background my-6 h-[6px] max-w-[75px] border-0"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just 25 years ago, the disease of measles was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html#cdc_generic_section_3-measles-elimination-in-the-united-states" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;declared to have been eliminated from the U.S.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Cases were sometimes imported from overseas, from people who traveled from Europe, Africa, or Asia. But not until this year did we have a measles death on U.S. soil; and not until this year have we had a notorious anti-vaxxer as the head of our Department of Health and Human Services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That department head, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has sorta-kinda acknowledged that vaccines have a role in preventing measles.  &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;This opinion piece&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that appeared under his name at Fox News carefully weaseled around the needed vaccine messages, saying that parents “should consult with their healthcare providers to understand their options” about the vaccine, and that “Good nutrition remains a best defense against most chronic and infectious illnesses.” Kennedy previously led an anti-vaccine propaganda organization that spread misinformation so egregious it got &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/18/technology/facebook-instagram-robert-kennedy-jr-misinformation.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;kicked off of Facebook&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrast his messaging with the World Health Organization, which is able to lay it out more plainly: “Being vaccinated is the best way to prevent getting sick with measles or spreading it to other people.” So far, the CDC’s website still has &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;accurate information about measles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including yet another plain statement that RFK, Jr. couldn’t bring himself to say: “The best protection against measles is measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While public health authorities in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Texas and elsewhere&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are doing their best to contain the latest outbreaks, RFK Jr. is &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/rfk-jr-it-would-be-better-if-everybody-got-measles/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;going on Fox News&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; talking up the "benefits" of measles infection and making the vaccine sound as bad as the disease. So, with the people in charge of the measles response sending mixed messages, I want to make sure the correct information is getting out there. So here’s what you should know about measles and the measles vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-mmr-or-mmrv-vaccines-are-the-best-protection-against-measles"&gt;The MMR or MMRV vaccines are the best protection against measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the absolute first and best thing to know: The measles vaccine protects you against measles. It is the &lt;em&gt;best protection we have&lt;/em&gt; against measles, as both the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;WHO&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will openly tell you. The World Health Organization estimates that measles vaccination saved 60 million lives worldwide between 2000-2023. Most measles deaths were among children under 5 who were not vaccinated, or who didn’t get the two recommended doses on schedule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two types of measles vaccine available: the MMR vaccine that provides protection against measles, mumps, and rubella; and the MMRV vaccine that covers those three plus varicella, better known as chicken pox. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;recommended schedule&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for MMR or MMRV vaccination is to get the first dose at an age of 12 to 15 months, and the second dose at age 4 to 6 years. Infants who are traveling or who live in a place with a measles outbreak can get a dose at age 6 months, but this protection isn’t expected to last long, so they will still need two more doses on the usual schedule. Adults and older children can also get a two-dose series (four weeks apart) if they didn't get it as kids or don't remember whether they got it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="measles-is-one-of-the-most-contagious-diseases-known-and-can-be-deadly"&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known, and can be deadly&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it worth vaccinating against measles? Yes, very much so. Anti-vaxxers like to point out that measles used to be a common childhood illness, which is true. But that doesn’t mean it’s harmless. Before vaccination was common, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr6204.pdf" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2013 report from the CDC’s vaccine advisory board&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there were 500,000 cases of measles in the U.S. in a typical year. Those resulted in 500 deaths, 48,000 hospitalizations, and 1,000 cases of permanent brain damage from encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is also horrendously contagious, perhaps the most contagious human disease known. For a comparison, the average person with the flu will give it to 1.3 other people. For ebola, that number is 1.8. For smallpox, before we eradicated it through vaccination, it was 3.5 to 6. Chickenpox is near the top of the list, with each sick person giving it to 10 to 12 others. But measles beats even that, spreading to 12 to 18 people, on average. I’m getting my numbers from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;this chart on Wikipedia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The exact number for each outbreak can depend on the specifics of the time and place it occurs, but these statistics are pretty widely agreed upon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is so contagious that, after an infected person leaves a room, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00522.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the air and surfaces in that room can infect people for the next two hours&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This is why just avoiding sick people isn’t enough, and why authorities announce where and when a person with measles was known to be in public, like &lt;a href="https://www.inquirer.com/health/measles-case-childrens-hospital-south-philadelphia-20250312.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;two Philadelphia children’s hospital locations on March 7 and 10&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Anybody who visited those places at those times is being told to find out if they are protected from measles and to talk to their healthcare provider about getting the vaccine if appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-measles-disease-is-so-so-much-worse-than-the-vaccine"&gt;The measles disease is so, so much worse than the vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy repeated a common and wrong anti-vaxxer talking point when he said that the measles vaccine “causes all the same illnesses” as measles. No, the vaccine does not give you measles. Even if he meant “all the same symptoms,” it’s still not true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He specifically called out encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain that can lead to death or brain damage. The measles vaccine causes 1-2 cases of encephalitis per &lt;em&gt;one million&lt;/em&gt; children vaccinated. Measles, on the other hand, causes encephalitis in 1-3 out of every &lt;em&gt;thousand&lt;/em&gt; children who get the disease, &lt;a href="https://www.encephalitis.info/types-of-encephalitis/infectious-encephalitis/measles-infection-and-encephalitis/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;according to Encephalitis International&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, measles the disease has &lt;em&gt;1,000 times greater&lt;/em&gt; encephalitis risk compared to the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy also claimed that the measles vaccine “cause[s] deaths every year,” which isn’t true. The Infectious Disease Society of America &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/public-health/measles/know-the-facts/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;says&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that “There have been no deaths shown to be related to the MMR vaccine in healthy people.” There &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; been a very few deaths from vaccine side effects in children who were immunocompromised, which is why the first step in getting a vaccine is talking to a healthcare professional who can determine whether it’s safe for you to get the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-vaccine-can-be-given-after-youre-exposed-to-the-measles-virus"&gt;The vaccine can be given after you’re exposed to the measles virus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best time to get an MMR vaccine is when you’re young, at 12-15 months and 4-6 years old. The second best time, if you’ve just been exposed to measles, is &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;. A dose of the vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;can be given within 72 hours of being exposed to the virus&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to provide last-minute protection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think you need the vaccine for this reason, ask your doctor. There is another option, which is to get a dose of immunoglobulin instead. It has to be one or the other, not both; the globulin can cancel out the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="vaccine-immunity-can-fade-but-not-as-much-as-rfk-jr-thinks"&gt;Vaccine immunity can fade, but not as much as RFK Jr thinks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After one dose of the MMR vaccine, you have a 93% chance of being protected against measles. After both recommended doses, that increases to 97%. This is exactly why two doses are recommended. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s probably true that immunity from a measles infection lasts longer than from the vaccine, but the vaccine still gives lifelong protection to the vast majority of people who got their two doses. Kennedy said that vaccinated people lose “4.5%” of their immunity each year. I don’t know where he got that number, but I did find &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(24)00181-6/fulltext" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a study that postulated a 0.04% waning per year&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—that’s about 100 times &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; than the number he cited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="for-the-love-of-god-you-do-not-want-natural-immunity"&gt;For the love of god, you do not want “natural” immunity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1950s and earlier, natural immunity—from getting infected—was the only measles immunity we had. Everybody still got the disease, because children without any measles immunity were constantly being born. Eventually they’d encounter the virus, and get sick. As I discussed above, this was fine for most kids and catastrophic for some. Read &lt;a href="https://fs.blog/roald-dahl-letter-daughter/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Roald Dahl’s letter about losing his daughter to measles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, if you haven’t already. She was healthy, and then she had a routine case of measles, and then she felt “all sleepy” one day, and shortly afterward, she was dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only way you get natural immunity is by rolling those dice. One child in every 1,000 died of measles. The other 999 carry that immunity with them for life, but only because they were lucky. The point of a vaccine is to give you the immunity &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; the risk of complications and death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which means, sorry, no measles parties. Or, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/measles/measles-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;as the Texas health department puts it&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “No! DSHS strongly advises against intentionally exposing anyone to infectious diseases like measles.” As they correctly point out, you’d be risking severe complications and death for the attendees of the party, you can’t predict how severe the symptoms will be, and you’re creating a bunch of walking measles vectors who can then transmit the virus to the elderly, unvaccinated, and immunocompromised. Vaccination, on the other hand, provides protection for 97% of those who receive the vaccine, with far smaller risks of complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-know-if-you-need-a-measles-vaccine"&gt;How to know if you need a measles vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I said that “everybody” used to get measles as a child, that’s true enough that the CDC and other health authorities rely on that fact to know who is immune. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/questions.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;If you were born before 1957&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—meaning you are 69 or older in 2025—you are assumed to have already survived a bout of measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also assume you are immune if you have medical records saying that you got two doses of the measles vaccine, or that you had a laboratory-confirmed case of measles, or that you have had a blood test that confirms your immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t remember whether you had the vaccine, you can get your immunity tested, but that’s not necessary. As the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;states&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “There's no harm in getting another dose if you may already be immune to measles, mumps, or rubella.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are in Texas, where the largest measles outbreak is currently occurring, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/measles" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;this page from Texas Health and Human Services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has information on staying safe, including where to get an MMR vaccine in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NewsNation&lt;/a&gt;) — Researchers at Stanford Medicine have discovered a naturally occurring molecule that they believe is similar to the active ingredient in the same &lt;a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/weight-loss-drugs-compound-fda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diabetes drugs&lt;/a&gt; that have shown weight loss potential.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BRINP2-related peptide, or BRP, is a naturally occurring molecule that can suppress appetite and promote weight loss in mice and pigs without causing common side effects like nausea, according to the &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/03/ozempic-rival.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, which was published in Nature.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discovery may provide a solution for those who suffer from some of the more severe side effects of Wegovy and Ozempic, which include inflammation of the pancreas, changes in vision, increased risk of thyroid cancer and others.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“The receptors targeted by semaglutide are found in the brain but also in the gut, pancreas and other tissues,” said assistant professor of pathology Katrin Svensson. “That’s why Ozempic has widespread effects, including slowing the movement of food through the digestive tract and lowering blood sugar levels. In contrast, BRP appears to act specifically in the hypothalamus, which controls appetite and metabolism.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/health-headlines/ap-yearslong-shortage-of-popular-weight-loss-and-diabetes-drugs-is-resolved-fda-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/ap-about-half-of-americans-approve-of-using-weight-loss-drugs-to-treat-obesity-ap-norc-poll-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Wegovy&lt;/a&gt; sales have soared in recent years, but shortages and challenges with insurance coverage have made it difficult for many patients to get the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 100 million adults in the U.S. are obese — defined as having a body mass index of 30 or higher — and more than 22 million adults are severely obese, with a BMI of 40 or higher.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;The blinding incompetence of this maladministration is matched only by its devotion to greed, hate, and delusion, the three poisons in Buddhist teaching. Similarly for the MAGAtroids and the Chrilstian Nationalists. Karma is their fate. Privilege is their watchword. Or you could call them out on the Seven Deadly Sins—&lt;span&gt;pride, greed, wrath, envy, lust, gluttony, and sloth. Or the Ten Commandments, or the Ten Precepts of Buddhism, or any other such list of fatal errors. Sunzi/Sun Tzu had another list of errors in war. These loonburgers are out to make them all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OUR watchword is Pushback. It’s working. More than a hundred legal cases. Town halls in supposedly blood red districts where even MAGA devotees aren’t having it. Protests everywhere. Actual candidates in every state FOR THE FIRST TIME, and nearly every district for nearly every office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A worsening measles &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5188576-texas-measles-outbreak-unvaccinated/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5188576-texas-measles-outbreak-unvaccinated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;outbreak in West Texas&lt;/a&gt; has spread to two other states, providing Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. his first real test of responding to a major public health incident.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The measles outbreak, which has killed two people to date and sickened nearly 260 &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5191117-measles-outbreak-texas-new-mexico/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5191117-measles-outbreak-texas-new-mexico/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;across three states&lt;/a&gt;, represents the first time Kennedy has had to reckon with his past as a longtime critic of vaccines and his new leadership of the federal health establishment. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Public health experts and advocates don’t think he is passing.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The response has been “as expected for a Secretary Kennedy HHS. But that’s not saying much,” said Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist who has been tracking the outbreak in her Your Local Epidemiologist newsletter.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has made two appearances on Fox News in recent weeks, where he downplayed the seriousness of measles and touted fringe theories about prevention and treatment, like the &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5178797-texas-measles-outbreak-kennedy-vaccines/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5178797-texas-measles-outbreak-kennedy-vaccines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;benefits of vitamin A&lt;/a&gt; and cod liver oil over the measles vaccine, which is the only proven way to prevent infection.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve had two measles deaths in 20 years in this country — we have 100,000 autism diagnoses every year,” Kennedy said. “We need to keep our eye on the ball. Chronic disease is our enemy.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;He suggested that natural immunity gained from a measles infection will provide better and longer-lasting protection than the vaccine. He said local doctors had achieved “almost miraculous and instantaneous” recoveries with steroids or antibiotics. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When he has talked about the shot, he’s framed it as a personal choice while also suggesting the vaccine can cause just as much harm as the disease itself. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Measles outbreaks in the past have been all-hands-on-deck affairs across the federal government, Jetelina said, pointing to a 2014 measles outbreak that began at Disneyland as well as the 2019 outbreak in New York. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This outbreak has largely been quiet. We’ve had the distant Fox News interviews. We’ve had one [CDC alert] and that’s about it, and that is not normal compared to past responses, and there’s certainly been very little transparency on what’s being done,” Jetelina said.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) team of infectious disease “detectives” arrived on the ground to aid in the response earlier this month, a move that first required Texas officials to request federal assistance, because the agency can’t send a team without an official state ask. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3" id="civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068" data-civicscience-widget="3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But experts said an early communications blackout across the government ordered by the Trump administration may have prevented local health officials from sharing data and information with HHS, potentially delaying the response. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health experts said one of the essential parts of controlling a measles outbreak is to partner with trusted messengers on the ground to spread the word that vaccines are safe. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The messaging should be very clear and straightforward in that the way we stop a measles outbreak is through vaccination. And the way we prevent measles outbreaks is through vaccination. And so that should be the clear, unambiguous message coming out from HHS,” said William Moss, a pediatrician and infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.  &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But in a sweeping 34-minute interview that was posted on Fox Nation last week, Kennedy pledged that the CDC team would talk to “front-line doctors and see what is working on the ground” and learn about therapeutics “ignored” by the agency, including vitamin A and an antibiotic called clarithromycin.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Phil Huang, director of health and human services in Dallas County, Texas, said he was concerned Kennedy’s words would dilute the message and make it more difficult to persuade people to get vaccinated.     &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy spoke about the distrust many in the Mennonite community have toward vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Vaccines will be “recommended,” Kennedy said, but as a personal choice that must be recognized. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He indicated the Mennonites have raised serious and legitimate concerns about the dangers of vaccines, and that he’d been told a dozen Mennonite children had been injured by vaccines in the county. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy said the public doesn’t know the true risks of vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know what the risk profile is for these products. Americans have the right to know to be able to make an informed choice. You need to know the cost and the benefits. And we’ve never quantified the cost. And that’s why there’s so much mistrust and we need to restore government trust,” Kennedy said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a separate interview with Sean Hannity, Kennedy again touted the benefits of vitamin A as an almost miracle cure, something even a Kennedy adviser has cautioned against. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Please do not rely on #VitaminA to save your child in the US – helps in Africa where there is deficiency-not here. I have both treated and buried children with measles,” Brett Giroir, a first-term Trump health official now advising Kennedy on infectious disease policy, &lt;a href="https://x.com/DrGiroir/status/1896353987093246011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;wrote in a post&lt;/a&gt; on the social platform X.  &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Vitamin A has been used for years in children in developing countries with severe measles, but doctors have said the evidence of its effectiveness is mixed. It isn’t used widely in the U.S., likely because children aren’t vitamin A-deficient. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Georges Benjamin, the longtime executive director of the American Public Health Association, said Kennedy’s HHS is already behind the outbreak and risks falling even further, which could result in a national outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He’s practicing medicine without a license, and he needs to be very careful,” Benjamin said. “Normally, what happens when you have someone who’s not a health professional? Their talking points are written by experts, and they stick to the script. And, you know, he’s saying things that are just wrong.”  &lt;/p&gt;

While many of these seem completely harmless because they’re available over the counter, doctors and nutritionists warn that you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; have too much of a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There is this perception that supplements are inherently safer than medications, and that's not always the case,” Jessica Cording, a dietitian and author of &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-little-book-of-game-changers-50-healthy-habits-for-managing-stress-anxiety-jessica-cording-ms-rd-cdn-inhc/VBZkiW39sSifg57S" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Little Book of Game-Changers;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Little Book of Game-Changers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, tells Yahoo Life. “Supplements can have very powerful effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="why-do-so-many-people-take-supplements"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do so many people take supplements?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While some supplements fill an important nutritional gap, such as if &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/why-we-need-vitamin-d--and-sun-exposure-isnt-the-only-way-to-get-it-090059898.html" data-ylk="slk:you’re low on vitamin D;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;you’re low on vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, others reach for these products because of what they promise to do for your overall well-being. “Regardless of your health goals, chances are that a supplement out there &lt;em&gt;claims&lt;/em&gt; it can help you,” &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" class="link " href="https://columbiasurgery.org/weight-loss/our-team" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Laura Natali;cpos:15;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Laura Natali&lt;/a&gt;, a dietitian at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, tells Yahoo Life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Naseem agrees. “A lot of people go by what the front label reads — things like ‘immune booster’ or ‘gut support,’” she says. But these claims aren’t always supported by research, especially given that supplements are a largely unregulated industry, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Some supplements have very important benefits,” says Natali. “But many have effects that are unclear and could even cause harm.” She adds: “Dietary supplements are often marketed as a solution for very common yet complex health issues like inflammation, fatigue or aging.

We really don’t know what the effects are,” he says. “Some of these — turmeric, St. John’s wort and ashwagandha — are known to have adverse effects on the liver.” Taking doses that are too high or mixing them with alcohol can cause damage, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Cording agrees. “We’re seeing this a lot with &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/ashwagandha-supplements-claim-lower-cortisol-110025053.html" data-ylk="slk:adaptogens, like ashwagandha;cpos:21;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;adaptogens, like ashwagandha&lt;/a&gt;,” she says. “People may take it in a supplement that contains different adaptogens, and then may have it in a functional beverage.

After all, she was a single parent to a three-year-old. She also worked full-time. Almost every day, when she picked her son up from daycare, she'd fall asleep with him during his afternoon nap. She didn't think much about it. "I just thought, 'Oh, this is motherhood'," says Ryan, who lives in upstate New York, US. At a routine medical check-up in June 2023, her doctor asked if she felt exhausted.

Despite regularly working out, Ryan had suddenly started to feel winded on routine hikes. She had also had iron deficiency before, during pregnancy. That time, her midwife suspected it after Ryan mentioned that her only pregnancy craving was ice – a classic sign of pica, which is, in turn, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10199804/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;a symptom of iron deficiency&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Iron deficiency is the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00029-3/fulltext" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;most common micronutrient deficiency&lt;/a&gt; in the world today, affecting roughly one in three people.

Infancy," says Mark Corkins, chair of the Committee on Nutrition at the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). "You triple your birth weight by a year of age. You double your length." As our bodies grow, they need more blood. And red blood cells are built – in part – on iron. Without that necessary iron, says Corkins, you risk not able to produce enough red blood cells to deliver oxygen to your growing tissues, including the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="callout-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eLrdPC"&gt;&lt;section class="sc-e11d1f0-0 eVThlc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-e11d1f0-1 kDQByp"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-e11d1f0-3 fBWdkT"&gt;Iron deficiency, iron-deficiency anaemia, and anaemia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-e11d1f0-2 ewSByo"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-e11d1f0-4 gxuhBx"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Anaemia occurs when someone is not producing enough normal red blood cells or haemoglobin, the substance that carries oxygen around in your blood. While this can be due to various factors, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(07)61235-5/fulltext" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;around half of all anaemia cases&lt;/a&gt; are caused by iron deficiency. Adults with this condition, iron-deficiency anaemia, might experience weakness, extreme fatigue, or shortness of breath, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/iron-deficiency-anemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355034" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;among other symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. Symptoms in babies and small children are similar, though they might also have sleep issues – particularly &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3632071/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;frequent night wakes, restlessness during sleep,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3632071/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;difficulty falling asleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Just because someone is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/126/5/1040/65343/Diagnosis-and-Prevention-of-Iron-Deficiency-and" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;iron deficient&lt;/a&gt; does not necessarily mean they will have anaemia. "Iron deficiency can be considered a stage prior to anaemia," says clinical haemotologist Sant-Rayn Pasricha, the head of the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health who specialises in iron deficiency and related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The severity of the deficiency plays a key role, Pasricha explains. When someone gets low on iron, their body begins to form red blood cells differently, he says. They get smaller and, eventually, the amount of oxygen-carrying haemoglobin in that person's blood drops below a healthy level. "That's when we reach iron deficiency anaemia," Pasricha says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Iron deficiency and anaemia are generally diagnosed with a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/iron-deficiency-anemia/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355040" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;blood test&lt;/a&gt; – usually one that examines levels of ferritin, a protein that helps store iron, or &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK259/#:~:text=Definition,deciliter%20(g%2Fdl)." class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;haemoglobin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;&lt;span id="a-matter-of-debate" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="a-matter-of-debate" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;A matter of debate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Some specialists question whether iron deficiency is always a cause for concern – especially if it arises in the absence of any physical symptoms and if the patient does not have anaemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;While those women in clinical trials who were iron deficient and reported feeling fatigued found that their fatigue improved upon taking iron supplements, the intervention didn't change the energy levels of women who were also iron deficient, but who had not reported fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"This hints to us that, at least in adults, if you're clinically unwell with an iron deficiency, then of course you should be treated and that will improve how you feel," Pasricha says. "But it also suggests that, if you're feeling perfectly fine, and someone just finds that you have a low iron level – then it's hard to be sure that that treating you then would boost you to feel any different."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Overall, iron deficiency in the absence of anaemia has been studied less than iron-deficiency anaemia. But there are some broad conclusions we can make, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The consensus is that iron-deficiency anaemia is certainly worse," says Zimmermann.

"It's not just about [poor health outcomes] – it is that you didn't maximise your development," Corkins says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This complexity lies at the heart of all nutrition research: is it the absence of a nutrient itself that's the problem, or is that deficiency a sign of something else going on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;To complicate matters further, the criteria for defining iron deficiency in children is still up for debate, says Zimmermann. Because children are growing so fast, he adds, iron deficiency normally quickly leads to anaemia – which means it's not easy to find, and study, iron-deficient children who are not anaemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;&lt;span id="to-supplement-or-not-to-supplement" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="to-supplement-or-not-to-supplement" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;To supplement or not to supplement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Given that, and the potential consequences for their development, guidelines often advise supplementing children with iron at any sign of deficiency – or even to supplement as a prevention measure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But some researchers question this approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We did see that haemoglobin and iron status did improve in the children that received iron – but we didn't see that affect child development," says Pasricha. The "why", he says, "is something that the team is really grappling with".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;One possible reason might be that even a brief period of deficiency can lead to long-lasting harm. One study, for example, found that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37143078/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;when children had had iron deficiency at birth&lt;/a&gt;, they had less activation in the regions of their brain related to cognitive control at eight to 11 years old – even if their iron levels had been corrected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But another possibility, Pasricha says, is that it isn't the low iron itself that causes poorer development, but that low iron is an indicator of something else – such as other nutrients in a person's diet that are missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Meanwhile, there could also be downsides to supplementing children who don't actually have a deficiency. Some studies have found that babies and toddlers who had adequate iron levels, but received supplementation, had &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140673694921512" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;poorer weight gain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12729289/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;less growth&lt;/a&gt; compared to controls. Randomised controlled trials have found that babies randomly assigned to high-iron formula milk scored more poorly on cognitive tests of abilities like visual memory, reading comprehension and mathematics at both &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22064877/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;10 years old&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31253407/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;16 years old&lt;/a&gt;, compared to those on a low-iron formulation. However, exactly how much iron supplementation would avoid these effects remains unclear, the researchers say as other factors could also be involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Supplements can also have other side effects. Zimmermann, for example, has studied &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/64/5/731.short" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;how supplementation can affect people's microbiome&lt;/a&gt;. Bacteria thrive on iron, he says. The very small amount of iron that breastmilk has is bound to protective substances like lactoferrin, which helps to keep iron away from potential pathogens in the gut – especially protective for babies, who have immature immune systems. Giving a baby aged six months old micronutrient powders containing iron, which is what many experts recommend, could result in a negative outcome, says Zimmermann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"These powders have very high amounts of iron in them… which can cause a very rapid shift in the microbiome," says Zimmermann. The babies can't absorb all that iron, which ends up impacting their gut microbiome – potentially towards a balance favouring "the pathogens we worry most about in babies", he says. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/64/5/731.short" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;This includes &lt;i id="e.-coli" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which grows prolifically in the presence of iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images If an iron deficiency is making an adult feel unwell, iron supplements can help – but the story is less straightforward in children (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;If an iron deficiency is making an adult feel unwell, iron supplements can help – but the story is less straightforward in children (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Many clinicians and researchers agree, however, that when someone has iron deficiency or iron-deficiency anaemia along with symptoms, supplementing can be one of the fastest ways to help them improve. One review of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/49/21/1389.short" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;iron deficiency in endurance athletes&lt;/a&gt;, for example, found that supplementation not only improved ferritin and haemoglobin, but athletes' aerobic capacity, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Whether to take supplements – or give them to a child – is something that people should decide with the help of a doctor, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;&lt;span id="a-balanced-diet" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="a-balanced-diet" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;A balanced diet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Part of the higher recommendation for younger babies is because of their rapid development, experts say. But it's also because there is an assumption being made that most infants' first solids will be foods like iron-fortified cereals, as well as fruits and vegetables – non-heme sources of iron, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/iron/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;which the body absorbs less readily&lt;/a&gt; than heme sources, which are animal-derived, like meat, fish and eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Diet is the best approach. Your body tends to take it up better. Your body tends to use it better," Corkins says.

He serves with the RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group and specializes in sports medicine, frequently identifying ways to strengthen the body. “The amount of mineral content in our bones helps them maintain their strength and resistance to fractures.

The vest is also equipped with reflective strips for visibility and a pocket to hold your keys, phone and other essentials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promising review:&lt;/strong&gt; "My workout program includes a daily walk/run. I have osteoporosis in my spine and I’d been looking for a weight vest to wear during my walks to possibly help rebuild bone density. I really like this vest because the straps are adjustable; there’re pockets in the front to hold keys, tissue, etc.; it doesn’t ride up or rub when I’m running; and the weights are easy to add and remove. The vest had a noticeable chemical smell when I first took it out the box, but the smell quickly dissipated after the vest sat out a couple days.

The lightweight pad weighs just 12 ounces so you can carry it wherever, and use it for Sellmeyer's recommended balance exercises as well as lunges, squats, planks and more. That's in addition to other uses around the house, like as a knee pad for gardening, a foot pad for underneath your desk and more. Talk about versatility. The pad is available in five colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promising review:&lt;/strong&gt; "Functions exactly as advertised. great for balance and core work. this pad has the perfect amount of "give" to work those areas. also the small waves on the surface help to prevent sliding on hard wood floors." — &lt;a href="https://r.bttn.io?btn_ref=org-677cb81987ed72f9&amp;amp;btn_url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DARAQTF1M6D5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?tag=erica-kam-20%26ascsubtag%3D67d03786e4b06805784b519f%252C-1%252C-1%252Cd%252C0%252C0%252Chp-fil-am%253D0%252C0%253A0%252C0%252C0%252C0" target="_blank" role="link" data-amazon-link="true" data-aps-asin="null" data-aps-asc-tag="null" data-aps-asc-subtag="null" rel="sponsored" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Mary S." data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d03786e4b06805784b519f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://r.bttn.io?btn_ref=org-677cb81987ed72f9&amp;amp;btn_url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DARAQTF1M6D5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?tag=erica-kam-20%26ascsubtag%3D67d03786e4b06805784b519f%252C-1%252C-1%252Cd%252C0%252C0%252Chp-fil-am%253D0%252C0%253A0%252C0%252C0%252C0" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="" data-vars-position-in-subunit="28"&gt;Mary S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="listicle-item-container wrapped " data-vars-affiliate="Amazon"&gt;&lt;div class="listicle-item image"&gt;&lt;p class="title-container"&gt;A pair of adjustable dumbbells for weight training&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Ho and Longobardi named adjustable dumbbells as a beneficial equipment option for resistance training. Why adjustable? "While free weights and resistance bands can help stimulate bone growth, it's important to begin with lighter resistance, gradually increasing in intensity to prevent injuries," Longobardi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ho added that adjustable equipment is more suitable for long-term use as you slowly up the intensity of your workouts. In other words, adjustable dumbbells involve taking on a higher cost upfront, but you'll save money later by not having to purchase new dumbbells so soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our pick is &lt;a href="https://r.bttn.io?btn_ref=org-677cb81987ed72f9&amp;amp;btn_url=https://www.amazon.com/Lifepro-Adjustable-Dumbbell-Dumbbells-Dumbell/dp/B08QTGV9BW?tag=erica-kam-20%26ascsubtag%3D67d03786e4b06805784b519f%252C-1%252C-1%252Cd%252C0%252C0%252Chp-fil-am%253D0%252C0%253A0%252C0%252C0%252C0" target="_blank" role="link" data-amazon-link="true" data-aps-asin="B08QTGV9BW" data-aps-asc-tag="erica-kam-20" data-aps-asc-subtag="67d03786e4b06805784b519f,-1,-1,d,0,0,hp-fil-am=0,0:0,0,0,0" rel="sponsored" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="this set from Lifepro" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d03786e4b06805784b519f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://r.bttn.io?btn_ref=org-677cb81987ed72f9&amp;amp;btn_url=https://www.amazon.com/Lifepro-Adjustable-Dumbbell-Dumbbells-Dumbell/dp/B08QTGV9BW?tag=erica-kam-20%26ascsubtag%3D67d03786e4b06805784b519f%252C-1%252C-1%252Cd%252C0%252C0%252Chp-fil-am%253D0%252C0%253A0%252C0%252C0%252C0" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="" data-vars-position-in-subunit="24"&gt;this set from Lifepro&lt;/a&gt;, which comes in three weight ranges.

(His responses have been lightly edited for length and clarity.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="is-the-us-prepared-for-another-pandemic"&gt;Is the U.S. prepared for another pandemic?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We are better prepared than we were five years ago. We are not as prepared as we need to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Preparedness is always an ongoing exercise. The U.S. military thinks a lot about preparedness, and they're constantly exercising, they're constantly updating. We need to have a very similar approach to thinking about health crises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The next one may be a natural pandemic. The next one may be a biological agent that's been man-made. We have got to be keeping on our toes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="what-has-improved-since-the-start-of-the-covid-19-pandemic--and-what-needs-to-improve"&gt;What has improved since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic — and what needs to improve?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We have a pretty good wastewater surveillance system that can help us track the spread of viruses around the country in a way we did not five years ago; we built that. Now a majority of communities are tracking various viruses using wastewater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What could be better is that we could expand that to more communities. We've got a majority, but we don't have everybody, and we could do that better. What I worry about is that that's going to get pulled back. A lot of that came originally from funding for COVID, and the current administration and their effort to cut everything may end up destroying our surveillance system, and that would be very, very bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The second thing that I think is better is we obviously have learned how to build vaccines very quickly. I think Operation Warp Speed was a huge success that taught us a lot about how to move vaccines forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I worry a lot about this administration's commitment to vaccines, even though ironically it was President Trump who brought us Operation Warp Speed. But obviously we have a health secretary who undermines vaccines at every step. I think that the big challenge is: Are we going to be able to continue investing in a new generation of vaccines or not?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A third area where I think we made a lot of progress that makes us better is if we get a major threat, we have learned how we can build up treatments quickly, particularly monoclonal antibodies. We built those very rapidly during COVID. They're going to be essential for the next pandemic, and we have to make sure we are investing in that platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="are-there-any-foreseeable-challenges-the-us-could-face-ahead-of-another-pandemic"&gt;Are there any foreseeable challenges the U.S. could face ahead of another pandemic?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Where I worry we may be worse off than we were five years ago is the sort of confidence in the scientific process. There has been such an active undermining of public health, of overplaying every mistake in public health. Now let's be clear, public health officials, public health experts didn't get it all right, we made mistakes, all of us did, and there is an active campaign to find every error, every mistake, and amplify it to try to discredit the entire public health enterprise. That means that if there is another crisis, it's going to be very hard to build confidence in a science-based response. We've got a lot of work to do between now and whenever that next crisis happens to try to build up that confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="should-we-be-worried-about-bird-flu"&gt;Should we be worried about bird flu?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bird flu has been something that a lot of us have been worried about for 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It's a virus that has a very high fatality rate. In the literature, about half the people who've gotten infected have died. That is obviously extraordinarily high, and we've all worried about it. We've always hoped that we would never see the day where we see a bird flu pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unfortunately, I think what we've seen in the last couple of years is things kind of moving in the wrong direction. It used to be that we almost never saw mammal populations getting infected. It was almost all largely among birds with the occasional spillover to people. Now we've seen large mammal die-offs. We've seen cows get infected. Obviously, the spread among birds is very large, and all of this is just substantially increasing the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So I think none of us knows if we're going to see a bird flu pandemic in three months, three years or 30 years. ... But the risk of it is very different now than it was five years ago, than even two years ago. When I say 'different,' I mean much higher, and we've got to start preparing with the concern that it might happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-about-measles"&gt;How about measles?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The problem is that if vaccination rates fall below 95% in the community, that community starts becoming vulnerable to the spread of measles. Let's say somebody who's unvaccinated comes from traveling abroad, brings measles back home or increasingly just gets it here, and if they go to a community with an 80% or 85% vaccination rate, you're going to start seeing an outbreak because it's so contagious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Obviously, people who are not vaccinated are at risk. But I want to remind us that there are many people who are not vaccinated who wish they could be. You have immunocompromised kids who might be undergoing cancer therapy. They can't get the vaccine, and they rely on everybody around them being vaccinated to protect them. If you're in a community with low vaccination rates, those kids are very vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Second is that the first dose of the measles vaccine isn't given until 12 to 15 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And the CDC recommends that parents don't travel to areas of measles outbreaks with kids less than 1 year of age until they've had their first shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Well, that's a problem if the outbreak is in the community where you live. So you may be a parent who's very committed to protecting your kids with vaccines, but you have a 4-month-old who can't get a vaccine yet. And that kid is vulnerable if they get measles, and they can get quite sick, and there's not much you can do about it, obviously, except avoiding being in contact with people with measles. But it's so contagious that you can't even reliably do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 09:00:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOT01aSldwc1ZQbnJPS0lwSWNqSEF1UGJOSzBWZmF0X3RMMTZwLW9SdElndVEyNGxMeHVPQlRMLTZvcXdZbEZFcHA2NGp2dzVLVnlnUGNpT0x3VlFYRXJCbmFlQmFuQ20wV04wNEotSGJ1WTYyeTRZXzE2Rk1Iclg1UWtZNlRGWnRZ</guid></item><item><title>Book Review: ‘Hypochondria,’ by Will Rees - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxPd2ZuamZKaFlpV1hwLXo0aGVRcXNGTjYyT3R2SVdUWlNDQ01nWnJKVXVwcVNsRC1ieklRVTFiRENXM2dWVzBPUm51UXhpTjZLaldJazNtNjlrOVMxMkVHSzFocjNBamNpOFE5cWExSTFueUtOalpGcDZfenRRRmtzVg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-798hid etfikam0"&gt;&lt;strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"&gt;HYPOCHONDRIA&lt;/strong&gt;, by Will Rees&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="css-7ad88g e1mu4ftr0"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;As a cultural attitude, “ignorance is bliss” has sort of fallen out of favor.

There, researchers analyze them for COVID-19 and other viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scanning wastewater for pathogens that cause diseases isn’t a new idea. Researchers used it to look for the polio virus in the 1940s.

They worked for the Metropolitan Council, which operates nine treatment plants in the Twin Cities metro. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sprouse, a manager in the Met Council’s Environmental Services, said staff at the plants were already taking daily wastewater samples to make sure the plants were operating properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But this idea of measuring genetic material to identify potential diseases — that was new,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure figure-none figure-full"&gt;&lt;picture class="" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://img.apmcdn.org/abe5a993d9976034030875270e2a3c7a0f3d4918/uncropped/00d4c2-20250312-wastewater01-webp400.webp 400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/abe5a993d9976034030875270e2a3c7a0f3d4918/uncropped/5493f6-20250312-wastewater01-webp600.webp 600w,https://img.apmcdn.org/abe5a993d9976034030875270e2a3c7a0f3d4918/uncropped/0b4798-20250312-wastewater01-webp1000.webp 1000w,https://img.apmcdn.org/abe5a993d9976034030875270e2a3c7a0f3d4918/uncropped/a21408-20250312-wastewater01-webp1400.webp 1400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/abe5a993d9976034030875270e2a3c7a0f3d4918/uncropped/a2df76-20250312-wastewater01-webp2000.webp 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 47.999em) 99vw, 66vw" data-testid="webp"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://img.apmcdn.org/abe5a993d9976034030875270e2a3c7a0f3d4918/uncropped/1e75e6-20250312-wastewater01-400.jpg 400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/abe5a993d9976034030875270e2a3c7a0f3d4918/uncropped/735ac5-20250312-wastewater01-600.jpg 600w,https://img.apmcdn.org/abe5a993d9976034030875270e2a3c7a0f3d4918/uncropped/4c1212-20250312-wastewater01-1000.jpg 1000w,https://img.apmcdn.org/abe5a993d9976034030875270e2a3c7a0f3d4918/uncropped/5ad885-20250312-wastewater01-1400.jpg 1400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/abe5a993d9976034030875270e2a3c7a0f3d4918/uncropped/c752ce-20250312-wastewater01-2000.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 47.999em) 99vw, 66vw" data-testid="notwebp"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.apmcdn.org/abe5a993d9976034030875270e2a3c7a0f3d4918/uncropped/735ac5-20250312-wastewater01-600.jpg" alt="Wastewater Surveillance"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure_caption"&gt;&lt;p class="figure_text"&gt;George Sprouse, manager of Process Engineering, R&amp;amp;D and Air Quality, explains how the Metro wastewater treatment plant operates at the facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="figure_credit"&gt;Ellen Schmidt for MPR News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balogh, a principal research scientist who retired last year, said prior to the pandemic, some places in Europe were scanning wastewater for illicit drugs. Early in the pandemic, the focus pivoted to using the surveillance to track COVID, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a while, the Met Council sent samples to a Massachusetts company. But Balogh said they decided they could get data faster for less cost by doing their own analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He reached out to Kenny Beckman, director of the University of Minnesota’s Genomics Center. They agreed to work together on a process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balogh developed a method to extract a nucleic acid called RNA from the wastewater. The Genomics Lab then used a technique called droplet digital PCR to detect the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They started monitoring in November 2020, as COVID was surging. Balogh said they watched the wastewater data reflect a spike in positive cases, then a month later, a falling trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By December, really, we were looking at it, saying, ‘Hey, I think this works,’” Balogh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure figure-none figure-full"&gt;&lt;picture class="" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://img.apmcdn.org/9721b798637121e1a3d2fd0da6a8fe93ee086532/uncropped/71af20-20250312-wastewater204-webp400.webp 400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/9721b798637121e1a3d2fd0da6a8fe93ee086532/uncropped/378f59-20250312-wastewater204-webp600.webp 600w,https://img.apmcdn.org/9721b798637121e1a3d2fd0da6a8fe93ee086532/uncropped/622ecb-20250312-wastewater204-webp1000.webp 1000w,https://img.apmcdn.org/9721b798637121e1a3d2fd0da6a8fe93ee086532/uncropped/9d2187-20250312-wastewater204-webp1400.webp 1400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/9721b798637121e1a3d2fd0da6a8fe93ee086532/uncropped/f5ea81-20250312-wastewater204-webp2000.webp 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 47.999em) 99vw, 66vw" data-testid="webp"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://img.apmcdn.org/9721b798637121e1a3d2fd0da6a8fe93ee086532/uncropped/eaae07-20250312-wastewater204-400.jpg 400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/9721b798637121e1a3d2fd0da6a8fe93ee086532/uncropped/e43881-20250312-wastewater204-600.jpg 600w,https://img.apmcdn.org/9721b798637121e1a3d2fd0da6a8fe93ee086532/uncropped/e4b7f5-20250312-wastewater204-1000.jpg 1000w,https://img.apmcdn.org/9721b798637121e1a3d2fd0da6a8fe93ee086532/uncropped/6746ae-20250312-wastewater204-1400.jpg 1400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/9721b798637121e1a3d2fd0da6a8fe93ee086532/uncropped/ed325c-20250312-wastewater204-2000.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 47.999em) 99vw, 66vw" data-testid="notwebp"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.apmcdn.org/9721b798637121e1a3d2fd0da6a8fe93ee086532/uncropped/e43881-20250312-wastewater204-600.jpg" alt="Wastewater Surveillance"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure_caption"&gt;&lt;p class="figure_text"&gt;Monica Rose, a lab coordinator, demonstrates taking a  sample at the Metro wastewater treatment plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="figure_credit"&gt;Ellen Schmidt for MPR News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wastewater offered some advantages over other forms of monitoring. People can start shedding the virus before they know they’re sick or show any symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it allowed health officials to keep tracking COVID even after many people stopped going to clinics to get tested, Beckman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The really critical advantage of wastewater is that once people start to do home testing and stop reporting their results, you lose that information,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, as the virus mutated, researchers were able to identify new strains in wastewater, such as Delta and Omicron, Beckman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the height of the pandemic, people were hungry for the real-time information wastewater provided. Schools used the data to decide whether to meet in person. Families used it to gauge whether it was safe to gather for holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Craig Helmstetter is managing partner of the &lt;a href="https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/mn-key-data#regionalwastewater" title="" class="apm-link default" data-testid="externalLink"&gt;APM Research Lab.&lt;/a&gt; His team analyzed the wastewater data and found it correlated strongly with hospitalizations. They began regularly tracking the data and using it for reporting on COVID trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was a welcome addition to the variety of data that we were looking at to try to get a handle on what was going on with the pandemic,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helmstetter said in the beginning, some people found the “ick” factor of wastewater humorous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think even among us, it’s a novel source,” he said. “There were various emojis used in social media … But that aside, it did become an important and serious way to look at what was a very serious thing happening and still happening in our state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="customHtml"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the Minnesota Health Department and U of M Medical School collect and analyze wastewater from more than 40 plants across the state. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also launched a national surveillance system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists and public health officials say as a leading indicator, wastewater surveillance is one more tool they can use to get a clearer picture of what’s making people sick, and what new public health threats may be looming on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they caution there’s still a lot they don’t know about the relationship between wastewater and certain illnesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, not everything that ends up at wastewater plants comes from humans. They also receive industrial or animal waste, said Stephanie Meyer, a supervisor in the state health department’s infectious disease division. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it’s not always clear how long people continue to shed a virus even after they’re no longer transmitting it to others, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We never want to use it to say, ‘Wastewater is indicating this, therefore there must be a giant outbreak happening of this disease,’” Meyer said. “That may not be true and it may not be accurate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure figure-none figure-full"&gt;&lt;picture class="" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://img.apmcdn.org/8dd197f72a8ac35ac4fe7bf7ce2eb2ba093123b5/uncropped/377220-20250312-wastewater206-webp400.webp 400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/8dd197f72a8ac35ac4fe7bf7ce2eb2ba093123b5/uncropped/22990b-20250312-wastewater206-webp600.webp 600w,https://img.apmcdn.org/8dd197f72a8ac35ac4fe7bf7ce2eb2ba093123b5/uncropped/1f7b99-20250312-wastewater206-webp1000.webp 1000w,https://img.apmcdn.org/8dd197f72a8ac35ac4fe7bf7ce2eb2ba093123b5/uncropped/a0dbac-20250312-wastewater206-webp1400.webp 1400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/8dd197f72a8ac35ac4fe7bf7ce2eb2ba093123b5/uncropped/325aed-20250312-wastewater206-webp2000.webp 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 47.999em) 99vw, 66vw" data-testid="webp"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://img.apmcdn.org/8dd197f72a8ac35ac4fe7bf7ce2eb2ba093123b5/uncropped/8b47b5-20250312-wastewater206-400.jpg 400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/8dd197f72a8ac35ac4fe7bf7ce2eb2ba093123b5/uncropped/4b78fe-20250312-wastewater206-600.jpg 600w,https://img.apmcdn.org/8dd197f72a8ac35ac4fe7bf7ce2eb2ba093123b5/uncropped/f6e1f3-20250312-wastewater206-1000.jpg 1000w,https://img.apmcdn.org/8dd197f72a8ac35ac4fe7bf7ce2eb2ba093123b5/uncropped/fd5acb-20250312-wastewater206-1400.jpg 1400w,https://img.apmcdn.org/8dd197f72a8ac35ac4fe7bf7ce2eb2ba093123b5/uncropped/816790-20250312-wastewater206-2000.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 47.999em) 99vw, 66vw" data-testid="notwebp"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.apmcdn.org/8dd197f72a8ac35ac4fe7bf7ce2eb2ba093123b5/uncropped/4b78fe-20250312-wastewater206-600.jpg" alt="Wastewater Surveillance"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure_caption"&gt;&lt;p class="figure_text"&gt;Environmental scientist Yabeing Nolet runs an analysis of total suspended solids in wastewater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="figure_credit"&gt;Ellen Schmidt for MPR News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather, along with reports from hospitals, clinics, emergency rooms and other information, wastewater is “an important piece of the puzzle,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the state health department and U of M Medical School still screen wastewater for COVID.

Researchers also found that the cumulative amount of NSAIDs did not decrease the risk for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that time of exposure matters regarding the potential benefits of NSAID use on dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of this study note that inflammation may be a critical piece in the development of dementia. NSAIDs help with inflammation and may affect dementia risk. This study sought to understand more about the long-term impact of NSAIDs on dementia risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used data from participants in the &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-017-0321-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Rotterdam Study&lt;/a&gt;, a current prospective population-based study in The Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the current analysis, researchers included participants who did not have baseline dementia, including 11,745 participants in the final analysis based on all their criteria. The average age of participants was around 66 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used pharmacy records to examine participants’ oral NSAID use. They also divided NSAIDs into two categories: beta-amyloid-42-lowering or non-beta-amyloid-42-lowering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This distinction had to do with previous data on how certain NSAIDs may affect amyloid levels in the brain. Accumulation of beta-amyloid in the brain is related to increased dementia risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants underwent regular dementia screening. Researchers also had data on several health indicators and lifestyle factors, including &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/270644" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323627" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/9152" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; levels, body mass index, education level, and smoking habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers divided participant NSAID use into four main categories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;no use&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;short-term use, which was less than 1 month&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;intermediate-term use, which was 1 month to 2 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;long-term use, which was more than 2 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional analyses used other time frames to allow for more assessment. Researchers used a few different models to look at the relationship between all-cause dementia and time of NSAID use and to account for different factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They further conducted several sensitivity analyses, such as looking at the relationship between NSAIDs and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/159442" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, and the association between dementia and salicylates, substances found in medications such as &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/161255" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;aspirin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers had an average follow-up time with participants of 14.5 years. During the follow-up, 81.3% of participants used NSAIDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just under 6% of participants used only NSAIDs that did not have beta-amyloid-42-lowering properties, and about 46% used a combination of non-beta-amyloid-42-lowering and beta-amyloid-42-lowering NSAIDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little over 2,000 participants developed dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short-term and intermediate-term use of NSAIDs slightly increased the risk for all-cause dementia, while long-term NSAID use decreased the risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The association between long-term NSAID use and reduced risk for Alzheimer’s disease was even stronger than for all-cause dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found that non-beta-amyloid-42-lowering NSAIDs appeared to lower the risk for all-cause dementia more than beta-amyloid-42-lowering NSAIDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers did not find an association between cumulative NSAID dose and dementia risk reduction. They also found that NSAIDs did not appear to lower the risk for all-cause dementia among participants who had the &lt;em&gt;APOE-e4&lt;/em&gt; allele.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;hl-trusted-source source="National Institute on Aging" rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/alzheimers-disease-genetics-fact-sheet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;APOE-e4&lt;/em&gt; allele&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; is a form of a gene, and having it can increase a person’s risk for Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/vernon-williams-156902.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Vernon Williams, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a sports neurologist and founding director of the Center for Sports Neurology and Pain Medicine at Cedars-Sinai Orthopaedics in Los Angeles, who was not involved in this research, commented with his thoughts on the study to &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s very interesting in that it is another piece of evidence that will hopefully contribute to our understanding of dementia and opportunities to reduce risk. There are some limitations to an observational study like this, but overall, it seems to be in line with other evidence and past studies that suggest inflammation as having a key role in neurodegeneration […] It further contributes to the understanding of chronic inflammation as a target for additional study and intervention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study does have some limitations. This study only included individuals from The Netherlands, and most participants were white, so the results cannot be generalized to all people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was some missing data for participants, and some information, such as alcohol use, was self-reported. The study also cannot establish cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was also able to only look at prescription use of NSAIDs, even though NSAIDs are also available over the counter. It’s possible that some participants who researchers noted not to be taking NSAIDs were doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s, researchers could not include biomarkers, so misclassification is possible. It is also possible that participants who used NSAIDs long-term were healthier than participants who only used NSAIDs in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers did account for the use of aspirin in one of the models. They did not categorize aspirin as an NSAID. When analyzing aspirin separately, they did not find an association between long-term use and reduced dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors note that with the slight increase in risk for all-cause dementia from short-term and intermediate-term use, the “effect estimates were too small to obtain clinical relevance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the researchers also acknowledge that looking at all-cause dementia includes dementia subtypes where NSAIDs may have no impact. Thus, if these subtypes are included in the analysis, it is possible to have weakened effect estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is also possible that researchers did not account for certain relevant factors or that participants were not taking prescribed medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;, study author &lt;a href="https://www.erasmusmc.nl/en/research/researchers/ikram-arfan-m" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Mohammad Arfan Ikram, MD, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, professor of epidemiology at the Erasmus University Medical Center in The Netherlands, further noted several limitations of their work:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[The] main limitation of this study is that it is an observational study, in which persons were not randomized. In other words, there is a reason why these individuals did versus did not take NSAIDs. These reasons may include arthritis, pain, or other inflammatory conditions. It is impossible in such studies to fully adjust for the effect of these other conditions. If these other conditions are in any way linked to dementia, it may then distort our findings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, this research highlights a potential benefit of NSAID use in the long term. This research could also help with creating therapeutics that protect against dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams noted that “the study suggests that exposure to anti-inflammatories over time may be of potential benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“However,” he cautioned, “there are potential side effects and risks associated with currently available NSAIDs. The findings that the association was stronger for non-amyloid lowering NSAIDs compared to those with known amyloid lowering properties is interesting in that it implies the mechanism of action may not be entirely related to amyloid reduction. So other anti-inflammatory pathways and/or genetic risk factor effects may be contributing to the benefits. “&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is likely needed before there are major changes to clinical recommendations. The study itself also notes that it may be inappropriate for older adults to use NSAIDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings alone are insufficient to start advising people to take NSAIDs for dementia.

			&lt;p&gt;Children under eight should not drink slushy ice drinks containing glycerol, researchers have warned after a string of hospitalisations in the UK and Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brightly coloured drinks marketed towards children often use glycerol as a sweetener and anti-freezing agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But high levels can be harmful, especially to children – glycerol intoxication can cause shock, low blood sugar and loss of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/consciousness" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73104" data-postid="154838" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;consciousness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a peer-reviewed medical review published in the &lt;a href="https://adc.bmj.com/content/early/2025/02/10/archdischild-2024-328109"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Archives of Disease in Childhood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; journal on Tuesday, researchers looked into a "recent apparent surge in cases" in the UK and Ireland, and suggested children under eight should avoid the drinks entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154858" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154858" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="terms-and-conditions"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/slushy_machine_642.jpg" alt="slushy machine" class="wp-image-154858 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/slushy_machine_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/slushy_machine_642-600x388.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154858" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Glycerol is sometimes added to icy drinks to keep them from freezing solid. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAC9doJlv_s/"&gt;dnberty/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They studied the medical records of 21 children aged two to seven who needed emergency treatment after drinking slushies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most cases took place between 2018 and 2024 and many of the children became acutely ill within an hour, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the children lost consciousness and showed signs of high blood acidity and low sugar, while four needed brain scans and one had a seizure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The children all recovered swiftly, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slushy machines were invented in the United States in the 1950s, and the drinks do not always contain glycerol because sugar can be used to stop them freezing solid instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggested the spate of cases could be linked to increased concern about high sugar consumption and sugar taxes adopted in the UK and Ireland in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food safety agencies in the two countries already advise that children aged four and under should not have slushies containing glycerol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the researchers said the age should be raised further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Younger children, especially those under eight years of age, should avoid slush ice drinks containing glycerol," &lt;a href="https://adc.bmj.com/content/early/2025/02/10/archdischild-2024-328109"&gt;they said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Clinicians and parents should be alert to the phenomenon, and public health bodies should ensure clear messaging."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review's authors also said there could be cases where children have suffered less serious illness and not been taken to hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In London, some parents said they supported raising the recommended age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mother Elsa Qorri, 46, told AFP she became worried after her two girls aged five and seven drank slushies last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They both got brain freeze and couldn't have any more," she said. "I'm not going to buy them again until the girls are a little bit older."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;© &lt;a href="terms-and-conditions"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you are one of the 34 million people in the US living with diabetes or the 97.6 million people with prediabetes, you probably know that what you eat directly impacts your blood sugar levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One meal that’s often &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-skip-breakfast-8417958" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;skipped&lt;/a&gt; or overlooked is breakfast—yet it’s essential. If you find yourself scratching your head over what to eat, don’t fret. Breakfast foods don’t need to be complicated. “A healthy and balanced breakfast can be delicious, practical and easy to prepare,” says &lt;a href="https://www.vandanasheth.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Vandana Sheth, RDN, CDCES, FAND&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and diabetes expert in Los Angeles. From whole-wheat toast with nut butter and berries to overnight oats, these stress-free options provide the nutrients you need to keep your blood sugar in check.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, regularly eating breakfast can “reduce sharp rises and falls in blood sugars, improve insulin sensitivity, prevent excess hunger and overeating later on, and stabilize energy and metabolism, which maintains blood sugar balance,” says &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinaiconciergecare.org/maria-fraga-rd/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Maria Fraga, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, diabetes alliance program director at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. When choosing a diabetes-appropriate breakfast, dietitians recommend high-fiber options. The American Diabetes Association recommends a goal of 14 grams of fiber per 1,000 calories consumed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, if you eat a 2,000-calorie diet, you should eat &lt;em&gt;at least &lt;/em&gt;28 grams of fiber daily.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there is no universal prescription for fiber needs at breakfast, “Aim to consume roughly 8 to 10 grams of fiber at breakfast to help you feel full and maintain steady blood sugar levels,” recommends Fraga.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other nutrients that help promote healthy blood sugars include protein and heart-healthy fats. This is because these two, along with fiber, help slow digestion and prevent high blood sugar spikes. Each breakfast choice below provides a mix of fiber, protein and healthy fats, while being low in added sugar and saturated fat. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-tofu-scramble-with-avocado--greens"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Tofu Scramble with Avocado &amp;amp; Greens  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to helping with blood sugar control, protein helps you feel fuller for longer. When it comes to high-protein breakfast foods, eggs are usually top of mind for many. And while they are an excellent option, plant-based sources, like tofu, have been shown to benefit people with diabetes and those at risk of diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, if you love scrambled eggs, you’ll probably also enjoy tofu scramble. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tofu scramble pairs well with avocados and dark leafy greens, which are rich in blood-sugar-stabilizing nutrients. One avocado contains almost 14 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Avocados are also rich in heart-healthy fat. Dark leafy greens like spinach, kale or collards also contain fiber, plus they are high in volume, vitamins and minerals that can enhance feelings of fullness. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-whole-grain-toast-with-almond-butter-berries--chia-seeds"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Whole-Grain Toast with Almond Butter, Berries &amp;amp; Chia Seeds  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Looking for something with natural sweetness? Consider a whole-grain, high-fiber bread with a smear of nut butter and antioxidant-packed berries. While any nut butter and fruit of your choice works well with toast, Sheth recommends it with almond butter, berries and chia seeds. When choosing a bread, dietitians recommend one with at least 3 grams of fiber per slice. As mentioned above, “Fiber slows down the conversion and absorption of glucose and helps with gut health,” notes Sheth. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your toast isn’t the only one providing fiber here. Berries and chia seeds are also rich in fiber, with 1 cup of raw blueberries providing 4 grams of fiber and 1 tablespoon of chia seeds nearly 5 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Greek Yogurt Parfait with Cinnamon &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8015607/greek-yogurt-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt; is another protein-rich option for a filling breakfast. “Protein supports a feeling of satiety and helps prevent blood sugar spikes,” says Sheth. In addition to protein, strained (Greek-style) yogurt contains probiotics, calcium and vitamin D (fortified). When managing diabetes, your best bet is to choose a nonfat or low-fat plain one. This is because excessive saturated fat can increase your risk of heart disease, which people with diabetes are more likely to develop.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Add a serving of fibrous fruit, chopped nuts and seeds, or a dollop of nut butter to make it extra filling and flavorful. Sheth loves pairing Greek or Icelandic yogurt with diced pear, chopped nuts and cinnamon. You can use fresh or frozen fruit for your convenience. Cinnamon has been studied for its therapeutic effects, from helping lower blood sugar and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cinnamon-and-lower-cholesterol-8535882" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; to reducing inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One study suggests that using ⅓ teaspoon of cinnamon daily over 12 weeks reduced fasting blood sugar in people with prediabetes (the precursor to diabetes). Still, more research is needed to confirm this effect.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;If you take medicine to manage your blood sugar, talk to your health care provider before using cinnamon daily since it can interact with your medication.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overnight oats are a winner when it comes to a quick grab-and-go breakfast. Plus, you can simplify your routine and make several servings of overnight oats for the week. “My go-to is overnight oats for steady energy and balanced blood sugar,” says  &lt;a href="https://beyoutifulnutritionllc.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Lila Cornelio, M.P.H., RDN,&lt;/a&gt; a registered dietitian nutritionist. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7872901/health-benefits-of-steel-cut-oats/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Oats&lt;/a&gt; are a source of complex carbohydrates and contain a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt; called beta-glucan. Beta-glucan has various health benefits, including helping lower insulin resistance, reduce blood sugar and cholesterol and support your gut.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Increased intake of whole grains, like oats, is also linked to reduced risk of developing diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Get creative with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/most-popular-overnight-oat-recipes-8757821" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;overnight oats&lt;/a&gt;. You can use ingredients like cherries, apples, blackberries, blueberries, pumpkin, flax, hemp or chia seeds and plant-based milks. Top with your favorite spices. Fraga recommends steel-cut oats with flaxseed, chopped peaches or strawberries, and cinnamon.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For a savory twist, make a veggie bowl with your favorite foods. Vegetables are rich in fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, and are low in calories, which can help with weight management. Weight management is key to improving your blood sugar levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When making a veggie bowl, you can easily incorporate the plate method—a tool to create balanced meals to avoid high or low blood sugar levels. The plate method encourages you to fill half of your plate with nonstarchy vegetables such as kale, onions, peppers, mushrooms, leeks, scallions and tomatoes, to name a few. Then, make one-quarter of your plate lean protein (think eggs or low-fat cottage cheese) and the other quarter carb-rich food, such as whole grains or starchy vegetables. You can drizzle olive oil on top for extra flavor and healthy fats. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking for breakfast combinations to improve your blood sugar levels, focus on nutrients like fiber, protein and healthy fats. You can find these in foods like fruit, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, strained (Greek-style) yogurt and avocado, which help you make a delicious, sustainable and nutritious breakfast. Remember that when it comes to managing diabetes, there is no one-size-fits-all. So, working with your primary health care provider for individualized assessment is always best. &lt;br&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Being married triples the risk of men becoming obese, research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chance of piling on the pounds increased for both sexes after marriage, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women's risk of being overweight was 39% higher - and men's 62% - compared with unmarried couples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But married men were 3.2 times more likely to be classed as technically obese than their unmarried counterparts, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding wasn't mirrored in females, which the Polish researchers said could be because women who are obese "are more often stigmatised" by society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Alicja Cicha-Mikolajczyk, from Warsaw's National Institute of Cardiology, suggested women "cannot accept living with obesity" and are more likely to take action to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, the NHS generally classes obese people as having a body mass index (BMI) of above 30, and being overweight is associated with a BMI of 25-30.&lt;/p&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;However, the measure (which looks only at height and weight) has been criticised by some as over simplistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study - which looked at 2,405 Polish people, typically aged 50 - also found getting older increased the risk of becoming heavier in both sexes.&lt;/p&gt;        
    
&lt;p&gt;Each extra year increased the risk of being overweight by 3% in men and 4% in women; and the risk of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/topic/obesity-7171/1" target="_blank"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by 4% in men and 6% in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression or poor health knowledge also had a significant impact on the risk of women becoming obese - but this wasn't found in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more from Sky News:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/norwegian-ski-jumpers-suspended-in-cheating-scandal-over-modified-suits-13327349" target="_blank"&gt;Ski jumpers suspended over modified suits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/pakistan-hostages-killed-after-separatist-militants-hijack-train-carrying-hundreds-of-passengers-13326922" target="_blank"&gt;Hostages killed after militants hijack train&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team concluded: "Age and marital status have undeniable impact on living with overweight or obesity in adulthood regardless of sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In turn, inadequate health literacy and having at least borderline depression were associated with obesity in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It appears from our results that the dissemination of health knowledge and health promotion across the lifespan could reduce the worrying phenomenon of increasing levels of obesity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings will be presented at the European Congress on Obesity in Spain in May.&lt;/p&gt;

            Cases in the ongoing measles outbreak have risen to 258 across Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma, and state health departments are urging more people to get the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq00023b5vqs67xs0f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In an interview with Fox News that aired Tuesday, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that “people ought to be able to make that choice for themselves. And what we need to do is give them the best information and encourage them to vaccinate. The vaccine does stop the spread of the disease.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000g3b5vav88tonm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Kennedy also downplayed the safety of the vaccine and wrongly told Fox News’ Sean Hannity that measles outbreaks could be driven in part by people who have waning immunity from the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq00053b5v0v5kz16s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you and I were kids, everybody got measles, and measles gave you … lifetime protection against measles infection. The vaccine doesn’t do that. The vaccine is effective for some people for life, but for many people, it wanes,” Kennedy told Hannity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000h3b5vxwevrnfw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Some years, we have hundreds of these outbreaks. … And, you know, part of that is that there are people who don’t vaccinate, but also the vaccine itself wanes. The vaccine wanes 4.5% per year,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000i3b5v3z5d4ls8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, says that if that were the case, measles wouldn’t have been declared eliminated in the US in 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000j3b5vo28cp0c5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s some dispute among experts about how much protection may wane, if at all. However, they all agree that in most cases, the vaccine confers lifelong immunity against the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000k3b5vfzpe8mrs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The current outbreak “is absolutely being driven and started by unvaccinated individuals,” said Dr. Michael Mina, chief scientific officer of the telehealth company eMed and an expert in the epidemiology, immunology and spread of infectious disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000l3b5vcnumhxex@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even those who may have waning immunity will not transmit large amounts of virus, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000n3b5vu7qf6jqq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Levels of antibodies created by the vaccine might decrease over time, but with a virus like measles, its longer incubation period gives the body’s immune memory cells more time to help fight the infection. This enables long-lasting immunity from vaccination, Offit explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trr000o3b5v4h6ba485@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since measles was declared eliminated in the US, there have been an average of about 179 cases reported each year, many of them related to international travel. There have been an average of about eight outbreaks per year – ranging from 1 to 25 annually – and most years, at least 60% of all reported cases have been tied to outbreaks. But even the worst outbreaks typically stay under 50 cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86g9olv00023b6mxzc4gjla@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is only the fifth year since 2000 that an outbreak has led to more than 100 cases and only the third year with more than 200 cases. The others were 2014, with an outbreak tied to Disneyland, and 2019, when a nearly year-long &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/health/measles-outbreak-new-york-2019-lessons-learned/index.html"&gt;outbreak in New York came&lt;/a&gt; within weeks of ending the nation’s elimination status.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq00043b5vh4511r14@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some of Kennedy’s statements promoted natural immunity, acquired when someone gets measles, over vaccine induced immunity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq00063b5va3ru8iqv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective against measles. People who were naturally infected with measles will also have immunity, but not without serious risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq00083b5vntjmvb6n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The goal of a vaccine is to induce the immunity that is a consequence of natural infection without paying the price of natural infection,” Offit said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq00093b5vt0ttubit@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The price of infection can be high: &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html#:~:text=Encephalitis.,deaf%20or%20with%20intellectual%20disability." target="_blank"&gt;One in five&lt;/a&gt; unvaccinated people with measles will be hospitalized, 1 in 20 children with measles will develop pneumonia, and 1 in 1,000 children with measles will develop encephalitis or swelling of the brain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000a3b5v2gwpstk4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One to three in 1,000 children who have measles will die from complications, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. A school-age child who was not vaccinated is among the two deaths that have already been associated with the ongoing measles outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000b3b5vbwnrlb9t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another possible consequence of infection is “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/01/health/measles-amnesia-study-intl-hnk-scli-scn/index.html"&gt;immune amnesia&lt;/a&gt;.” When the measles virus infects immune cells, it can erase the body’s memory of how to fight other infections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000c3b5v8d7lomlf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “So if you want to take the natural immunity route … you’re destroying your previously existing immune memory and putting yourself at risk for every other infection that you could get. And so there is no world in which measles is good for the body, and there’s no world in which getting measles infection is better than getting a measles vaccine,” Mina said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000d3b5vvmg0itxf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy also inaccurately said vaccine-induced immunity may not be passed through breast milk to nursing infants the way natural immunity is.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000e3b5vo9dpuopq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He is wrong. Maternal antibody transfer is a key form of neonatal protection against infectious diseases,” said Dr. Lynn Yee, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine. “Even when a mother had vaccination many years ago, antibodies still transfer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f6gni001b3b5vqrw4t065@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is especially important because infants can get protection against the virus through antibodies from their mother in the first six months of life, when they are too young to be vaccinated, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trr000q3b5vlis2ldbd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy also incorrectly described adverse events from the MMR vaccine, saying it “causes deaths every year. … It causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes: encephalitis and blindness, et cetera.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86h84sf00053b5vufashffu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine, called this “disinformation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86i7fzb000r3b6m5x054zpu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The measles vaccine is incredibly safe,” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “This is what anti-vaccine activists do is, they play up and try to scare you with the very, very rare side effects and forget to tell you about the horrific effects of the illness.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86fiw6100003b5vq5g5pbyc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles infection can cause encephalitis and blindness, but only a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" target="_blank"&gt;handful&lt;/a&gt; of these kinds of illnesses related to vaccination have ever been reported.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trr000r3b5v67vvpdlu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4599698/pdf/nihms724114.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in which the US Food and Drug Administration and the CDC reviewed reports from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, in addition to medical records, death certificates, and autopsy reports, did not find evidence to suggest “a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and death.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trr000s3b5vettes80u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The MMR vaccine is extremely safe. The most common side effects that people may get is the low-grade fever for a few days, and sometimes people can get this temporary rash It usually resolves within 24 to 48 hours. Those are by far the most common symptoms, and there are a few more that are much less common, but they are extremely rare,” said Dr. Vivek Cherian, a Chicago-based internal medicine doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86gt7ax00023b5vgkyh5pve@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More serious side effects from vaccination are extremely rare, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trr000t3b5vvqkkehye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “All of those [common side effects] are signs that the vaccine is working and your immune system is mounting the responses it’s supposed to to gain memory to protect you later. But many folks are touting these as significant adverse events, and so I think that the devil is really in the details on this,” said Dr. Christina Johns, a pediatric emergency physician at PM Pediatrics in Annapolis, Maryland.
    &lt;/p&gt;

by then she had tried six different contraceptive pills to find a way of helping her pain, but nothing seemed to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I came off the pill and that's when my periods became absolutely, completely unmanageable. They took over my life. I wasn't going to university, I wasn't going to work," Ami says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"If I was going to work, I was collapsing in pain consistently every single month."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ami kept going back to her GP because the pain was "completely unbearable".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I was just so desperate, my mental health was on the floor.

It was like 20 to 25 days out of the month where I was just completely bed-bound," she told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ami had her first surgery in October 2021, which reduced the pain for seven or eight months, but then it gradually came back. A second operation in April 2024  was not as successful. She is now trying to raise enough money to have a third surgery, privately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ami says it is good to hear that further treatment is being developed for endometriosis because "a lot of the time it feels like you're being left in the dark".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Usually, the first treatments for endometriosis, after pain relievers, are hormone injections which temporarily shut down the body's production of estrogen. This is the hormone that causes endometriosis tissue to grow and cause pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, patients often need to travel to hospitals to have the injections, which last for up to three months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;With the new all-in-one tablet, there is no need for patients to remember to take hormone replacement therapy as a separate tablet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It can be stopped quickly if side effects are difficult and taken up until the menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It's a step forward and will give patients more choice, but it will impact a relatively small number of people," says Emma Cox, chief executive of Endometriosis UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We need to see more investment in other research and treatments," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The treatment will cost £72 for a 28-day supply, NICE said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 00:43:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE41cVRlSlhBRHo5Y0Eza05JdF9vSHdvbmpxOTZlWjk2Z1BDQWgzLWlhTUVVX2tMZ2RZdXhURHdJbHFBdTNBTnJLd3BxOXlWWVdDcVVUeW1kNnFiZ9IBX0FVX3lxTFAzbWhJNm0wQzJqRmladTlKbjVuUHZYODZtVlh4OW1BWC1aRm9xVEdtUlNXc2Z0cTlZaUE3TG1ESEFtU1BEQ19zQmZEOEJwWXJhbjFXbFQ4Q3hDM0ttWE13</guid></item><item><title>Millennials Were Raised As The 'Always On' Generation — 'Honestly, We Have Nothing Left To Give' - YourTango</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTFBRcndzWXlzRzJDYXYyWXN4MDYwNHRsX3VDUGZTT3JCcFNIa3FhNmw4SkxBWUdnY3BNNnhpdC1wcDQ5SnJxeVhYQzRsV3FxS3RuOUxtX2FnNzhxWHNqemFMLVpDN0c0bDhZWVRGWE95NFBsSHhhMjFuR0F3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;&lt;p id="46a0" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;In a hyper-connected world where technology is deeply intertwined with our daily lives, the boundaries between work and personal life have become increasingly blurred.

which can initially worsen symptoms, the pill can be taken at home, works more quickly and combines hormones in one pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Endometriosis is a condition where tissue

periods, bowel movements, urination and sex. It is thought to affect about one in 10 women of reproductive age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Endometriosis care has also long been recognised as substandard, with a previous report finding that on average women are &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/mar/04/women-in-uk-waiting-almost-nine-years-for-endometriosis-diagnosis-study-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;waiting nearly nine years for a diagnosis in the UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The treatment will be available through routine &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; commissioning for those that medical or surgical treatment for endometriosis has failed.

                Scientists who research vaccine hesitancy and uptake are seeing their federal funding cut, under a Trump administration move. It's part of a swathe of cuts to ongoing research funded by NIH.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration is slashing long-standing areas of research funded by the National Institutes of Health, claiming they no longer align with the agency's priorities.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The latest target?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Millions of dollars in NIH grants for studying vaccine hesitancy and how to improve immunization levels. It's work that's particularly relevant as a measles outbreak grips the Southwest amidst diminishing vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, scientists around the country have begun receiving letters stating their existing grants — money already awarded to them in a competitive process — were being cut.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At first, the cuts appeared to primarily target research on LGBTQ+ health and other areas that were deemed in conflict with President Trump's executive orders on gender and "diversity, equity and inclusion."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Now, more than 40 grants related to vaccine hesitancy have been cancelled, and there are mounting concerns that research on mRNA vaccines could be on the chopping block next.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR obtained information about the changes from two NIH staffers and one person familiar with NIH's activities who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. And, NPR reviewed emails and documents they provided.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I want to underscore just how unprecedented — how abnormal all of this is," one longtime NIH official told NPR. "This is not how we operate."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;An email circulated among NIH leadership this week included a list of grants that were to be terminated and details on the specific language to use in those notices. "It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize research activities that focuses gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment," the email states.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's unclear exactly how many grants have been cancelled in total under the Trump administration. Neither the NIH nor its parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, replied to NPR's request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It appears that there are forces intent on destroying our existing vaccine enterprise," says &lt;a href="https://www.fammed.wisc.edu/directory/286/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jonathan Temte&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of family medicine at the University of Wisconsin who studies vaccine hesitancy. "Defunding research on vaccine hesitancy is the latest example of this effort."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;mRNA research may be at risk&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In what some at the agency view as an ominous sign, the NIH's acting director Dr. Matthew Memoli also requested information last week about the funding that supports mRNA vaccine research, technology that underpins the COVID-19 shots from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, according to an email reviewed by NPR. A similar call for data preceded the termination of the other vaccine grants.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"NIH staff internally are very worried that the mRNA grants will follow the outcome of the vaccine hesitancy grants and be terminated," according to one of the NIH employees who wasn't authorized to speak publicly. "There are widespread concerns that this will limit the ability to combat pandemics and halt promising lifesaving cancer treatments."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR reviewed the NIH list of 130 of these awards issued by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID, which funds the most mRNA research. This includes efforts to develop vaccines for a variety of diseases, including Lyme disease, dengue and a sometimes life-threatening gastrointestinal infection known as &lt;em&gt;Clostridium difficile&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Other parts of the NIH like the National Cancer Institute also fund this work, because mRNA technology holds promise for targeted cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I am on pins and needles constantly," says &lt;a href="https://chicago.medicine.uic.edu/microbiology/profiles/richner-justin/" target="_blank"&gt;Justin Richner&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Illinois, Chicago. "I'm really kind of waiting for the shoe to drop in terms of looking for the email saying the grant has been canceled."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Richner's $1 million, 4-year NIH grant is on the agency's internal list. His lab is working to develop an mRNA vaccine to protect against dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease that affects millions of people worldwide and is spreading in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's an outrageous incursion on the way in which the NIH is managing the money that's been appropriated by Congress," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://vivo.weill.cornell.edu/display/cwid-varmus" target="_blank"&gt;Harold Varmus&lt;/a&gt;, a Nobel Prize winning professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College who ran the NIH from 1993 to 1999. "The idea that we're going to turn one of the most prestigious aspects of federally supported activities into a graveyard is very troubling to everybody."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.uiowa.edu/internalmedicine/profile/aaron-scherer" target="_blank"&gt;Aaron Scherer&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at the University of Iowa who studies vaccine hesitancy, says his grants are not canceled as far as he knows, but given what's happening, he assumes that NIH will not be funding his future proposal "regardless of its scientific and health merits."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Health disparities and LGBTQ+ research loses ground&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vaccine research is just the latest target in the Trump administration's expanding effort to cut off NIH-funded researchers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A first wave of letters went out last month to researchers notifying them their grants were being canceled because they did not fit with President Trump's executive orders.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Letters of termination reviewed by NPR state "no modification of the project could align the project with agency priorities," but a current NIH employee told NPR that the scientific staff at their institute who would be responsible for making that determination are not being consulted. "They're not checking with us," said the person, adding that these termination decisions are coming with virtually no notice.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to an internal memo, NIH staff were directed to separate awards into different categories depending, for example, on whether the "sole purpose of the project is DEI related" or could still be viable if modified.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The guidance also has implications for hundreds of awards in the coming months, because many "Notices of Funding Opportunities" have been taken down, and grants that applied through those notices will not get their funding, either, the NIH staffer told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/brittany-charlton/" target="_blank"&gt;Brittany Charlton&lt;/a&gt;, who directs the LGBTQ Health Center of Excellence at Harvard University, says she's tallied two dozen awards that have been terminated among her colleagues for work that touches on issues like HIV prevention and Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The cuts are not only affecting research on the LGBTQ+ population but also other vulnerable communities, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We're not studying fringe issues, and they're not at all ideological either,"  Charlton says, "The research that's being abruptly terminated by the federal government right now is really meant to identify what underlies some of these disparities and help to address them."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The good and the bad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/cholesterollevelswhatyouneedtoknow.html"&gt;For reference&lt;/a&gt;, the optimal LDL level for adults is less than 100 mg/dL, and optimal HDL is 60 mg/dL or higher. Higher LDL levels can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, and other health problems, while higher HDL has a protective effect against cardiovascular disease. Though some of the changes reported in the study were small, the researchers note that they could be meaningful in some cases. For instance, an increase of 5 mg/dL in LDL is enough to raise the risk of a cardiovascular event by 2 percent to 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers ran three different models to adjust for a variety of factors, including basics like age, sex, body mass index, as well as medical conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, and lifestyle factors, such as exercise, dietary habits, and smoking. All the models showed the same associations. They also broke out the data by what kinds of alcohol people reported drinking—wine, beer, sake, other liquors and spirits. The results were the same across the categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study isn't the first to find good news for drinkers' cholesterol levels, though it's one of the larger studies with longer follow-up time. And it's long been found that alcohol drinking seems to have some benefits for cardiovascular health. &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/28582/review-of-evidence-on-alcohol-and-health"&gt;A recent review and meta-analysis by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine&lt;/a&gt; found that moderate drinkers had lower relative risks of heart attacks and strokes. The analysis also found that drinkers had a lower risk of all-cause mortality (death by any cause). The study did, however, find increased risks of breast cancer. &lt;a href="https://www.stopalcoholabuse.gov/media/pdf/Report-on-Alcohol-Intake-and-Health.pdf"&gt;Another recent review&lt;/a&gt; found increased risk of colorectal, female breast, liver, oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, the new cholesterol findings aren't an invitation for nondrinkers to start drinking or for heavy drinkers to keep hitting the bottle hard, the researchers caution. There are a lot of other risks to consider. For drinkers who aren't interested in quitting, the researchers recommend taking it easy. And those who do want to quit should keep a careful eye on their cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their words: "Public health recommendations should continue to emphasize moderation in alcohol consumption, but cholesterol levels should be carefully monitored after alcohol cessation to mitigate potential [cardiovascular disease] risks," the researchers conclude.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;What's good for your aging gut may also be good for your aging brain. The first study of its kind in twins found that taking daily protein and prebiotic supplements can improve scores on memory tests in people over the age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, published last year, are food for thought, especially as the same visual memory and learning test is used to detect early signs of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="154573" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The double-blinded trial involved two cheap plant fiber prebiotics that are available over the counter in numerous nations around the world. Prebiotics are non-digestible consumables that help stimulate our gut microbes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inulin"&gt;inulin&lt;/a&gt;, and it is a dietary fiber in the class fructan. Another is called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructooligosaccharide"&gt;fructooligosaccharide&lt;/a&gt; (FOS), and it is a plant carbohydrate often used as a natural low calorie sweetener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144930" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144930" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/LowCalorieSweetenerCupOfTea642.jpg" alt="Aerial view of a cup of tea next to sachets of sweetener" class="size-full wp-image-144930" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/LowCalorieSweetenerCupOfTea642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/LowCalorieSweetenerCupOfTea642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/LowCalorieSweetenerCupOfTea642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144930" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Fructooligosaccharide is often used as a natural low calorie sweetener. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAFb-9YB388/"&gt;towfiqu barbhuiya/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the effect of these supplements on the aging brain, researchers at King's College London enrolled 36 pairs of twins over the age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each duo was randomly split so that one twin was assigned a daily prebiotic in a protein powder and the other was assigned a daily  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="154573" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; in a protein powder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twin who unknowingly took inulin or FOS generally scored higher on a cognitive test three months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, the daily fiber supplements were linked to slight changes in the gut microbiome between twins. The beneficial &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00925/full"&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, were more plentiful in twins taking inulin or FOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144933" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144933" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GutBacteriaMicrobiome642.jpg" alt="Illustration of bacteria in the gut" class="size-full wp-image-144933" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GutBacteriaMicrobiome642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GutBacteriaMicrobiome642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GutBacteriaMicrobiome642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144933" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Daily fiber supplements were linked to slight changes in the gut microbiome between twins.

&lt;p&gt;"We are excited to see these changes in just 12 weeks. This holds huge promise for enhancing brain health and memory in our aging population," &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/daily-fibre-supplement-improves-older-brain-12-weeks"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Mary Ni Lochlainn, a geriatric medicine researcher at King's College London, when the findings were published in March 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Unlocking the secrets of the gut-brain axis could offer new approaches for living more healthily for longer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uXEf1Xfh1bY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;King's College is home to the United Kingdom's largest adult twin registry, and twin studies are highly valuable when it comes to differentiating between the effect of genetics and the environment on human health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/77/2/81/5237462?login=false#127953545"&gt;Past studies on rodents&lt;/a&gt; suggest that high-fiber supplements, like inulin and FOS, can 'feed' the colon's microbiome, allowing 'good' bacteria to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these bacterial players are &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.3c00652"&gt;also linked&lt;/a&gt; to improved cognitive function in both mice and &lt;a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad200488"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144937" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144937" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwinsSmiling642.jpg" alt="Twin sisters smiling with arms around each other" class="size-full wp-image-144937" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwinsSmiling642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwinsSmiling642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwinsSmiling642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144937" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Twin studies are highly valuable when it comes to differentiating between the effect of genetics and the environment on human health.

Some experts are now so convinced by the results, they &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news-events/publications-archive/brain/gut-brain"&gt;refer to the gut&lt;/a&gt; as the body's 'second brain'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the way these two nervous systems work together remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent twin study at KCL suggests that consuming certain 'brain foods' may be a promising way to treat cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while prebiotics might improve some aspects of cognitive function in an aging brain, like memory and processing times, there don't appear to be significant physical benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muscle loss didn't improve among aging twins taking high-fiber supplements, despite the fact that inulin and FOS are important factors in musculoskeletal maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These plant fibers, which are cheap and available over the counter, could benefit a wide group of people in these cash-strapped times. They are safe and acceptable too," &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/daily-fibre-supplement-improves-older-brain-12-weeks"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; geriatrician Claire Steves at KCL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our next task is to see whether these effects are sustained over longer periods and in larger groups of people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144939" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144939" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderAdultsSmilingDoingJigsawAlzheimers642.jpg" alt="Senior couple completing a jigsaw" class="size-full wp-image-144939" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderAdultsSmilingDoingJigsawAlzheimers642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderAdultsSmilingDoingJigsawAlzheimers642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderAdultsSmilingDoingJigsawAlzheimers642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144939" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;What's good for your aging gut may also be good for your aging brain.

&lt;p&gt;That said, females are more susceptible to Alzheimer's disease, and studies like the current one support the emerging idea that cognitive decline is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-might-not-actually-be-a-brain-disease-expert-reveals"&gt;not always a disease of the brain&lt;/a&gt;, but may involve external factors, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gut has its fingers in many bodily 'pies', including the immune system and the central nervous system. Feeding its microbiome certain &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10410452/"&gt;prebiotics and probiotics&lt;/a&gt; could open the door to treating a plethora of illnesses and diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46116-y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in March 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

						The Pennsylvania Department of Health and Philadelphia Department of Health are notifying the public about a potential measles exposure at two locations.South Philadelphia Health &amp;amp; Literacy CenterThis building includes CHOP Pediatric Primary Care South Philadelphia, Health Department Health Center #2, and the South Philadelphia Library, though there were no potential exposures in the library.1700 South Broad Street, Philadelphia, PA 19145Friday, March 7 between 10:45 a.m. and 2:40 p.m.Saturday, March 8, between 9:05 a.m. and 1:20 p.m.CHOP Emergency Department3401 Civic Center Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA, 19104Monday, March 10, 2025, 7:55 a.m. to 10:15 a.m.The infected person was exposed while traveling abroad, according to health officials. It is not connected to the recent measles case in Montgomery County or cases in other parts of the country.What to doIf you were potentially exposed, follow these instructions from the health department:Determine if you are protected against measles. Generally, you are considered protected if you:Were born before 1957, orHave already had measles, orHave a blood test showing immunity to measles, orHave written documentation of adequate vaccines for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR vaccine)Look at your vaccination records or ask your health care provider to see if you have already had the age-appropriate dose or doses of this vaccine.Measles vaccine is routinely recommended for children 12–15 months old with a second dose given at age 4–6 years. Infants under 12 months are not routinely eligible for vaccine and are not protected.If you are protected from measles, you do not have to do anything. The vaccine is extremely effective at preventing measles.If you are not protected from measles, there are things you can do to keep yourself and others safe.If you were at the CHOP Emergency Department on March 10 during the times listed above, you should receive a dose of MMR vaccine before March 13. Talk to your health care provider to learn how you can get this vaccine. The health department has additional resources on where to get vaccines on its website. If you do not receive an MMR vaccine, you will need to stay home for 21 days.If you were at the South Philadelphia Health &amp;amp; Literacy Center on March 7 during the times listed above, you should contact your health care provider and stay at home until March 27. Contact your health care provider if you develop symptoms.If you were at the South Philadelphia Health &amp;amp; Literacy Center on March 8 during the times listed above, you should contact your health care provider and stay at home until March 28. Contact your health care provider if you develop symptoms.If you develop any measles-like symptoms through March 31, contact your doctor immediately. The early symptoms of measles are fever, runny nose, cough, and puffy eyes, followed by a rash.Tell your doctor before visiting that you may have been exposed to measles.You should also notify the Philadelphia Department of Public Health by calling 215-685-6740, then pressing option 5.About measlesMeasles is a virus that spreads very easily from person to person among unvaccinated people. Anyone with measles can spread the virus to others who are not immune through direct contact with respiratory droplets, or through droplets in the air from coughing and sneezing.The early symptoms of measles are fever, runny nose, cough, and puffy eyes, followed by rash. Measles is contagious for four days before to four days after the rash starts.In some people, including infants and those with weakened immune systems, it can be a very serious infection that leads to pneumonia, brain infection or death.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunburns and aging skin are obvious effects of exposure to harmful UV rays, tobacco smoke and other carcinogens. But the effects aren't just skin deep. Inside the body, DNA is literally being torn apart.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;Understanding how the body heals and protects itself from DNA damage is vital for treating genetic disorders and life-threatening diseases such as cancer. But despite numerous studies and medical advances, much about the molecular mechanisms of DNA repair remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past several years, researchers at Georgia State University have tapped into the Summit supercomputer at the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory to study an elaborate molecular pathway called &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/nucleotide+excision+repair/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;nucleotide excision repair&lt;/a&gt; (NER). NER relies on an array of highly dynamic protein complexes to cut out (excise) damaged DNA with surgical precision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their latest study, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52860-y" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt;, the team has built a computer model of a critical NER component called the pre-incision complex, or PInC. PInC plays a key role in regulating DNA repair processes in the latter stages of the NER pathway. Decoding NER's sophisticated sequence of events and the role of PInC in the pathway could provide key insights into developing novel treatments and preventing conditions that lead to premature aging and certain types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're interested in the way cells repair their genetic material," said lead investigator Ivaylo Ivanov, a chemistry professor at Georgia State University. "NER is a versatile pathway that repairs all kinds of different DNA damage using a three-stage process that relies on delicately balanced molecular machinery. Unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/harmful+mutations/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;harmful mutations&lt;/a&gt; can develop that interfere with this machinery and cause severe human diseases."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yet, the effects of genetic mutations can be strikingly different depending on their positions within the repair complexes. In some cases, mutations result in patients having UV light sensitivity and an extreme cancer predisposition. In other cases, they cause abnormal development and premature aging," he said. "Why that happens is not completely understood at the molecular level. That's the mystery our computer modeling efforts aim to unravel."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;The three acts of repair&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NER unfolds in three distinct stages: recognition, verification and repair. Each stage requires different groups of proteins to perform specific functions, much like a trauma team has different specialists needed to treat injured patients in the emergency room. In that way, the NER machinery can adapt and change its shape depending on the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first stage, the NER protein XPC (xeroderma pigmentosum group C) acts like a first responder that locates the site of the damaged DNA, or lesion, and then twists the DNA helix to make the damage accessible. XPC then calls in other repair proteins to help initiate the second stage, called damage verification, or lesion scanning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the NER protein machinery shifts into its next shape. As XPC steps back, the protein complex called transcription factor IIH, or TFIIH (pronounced T-F-2-H), moves into position. TFIIH further unwinds the section of DNA and scans the newly exposed strand for lesions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, it's in the hands of the surgeon—the PInC—in the third and final stage of repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the "patient" stabilized and prepped for surgery, the operation to remove the damaged DNA strand can begin. Two enzymes, XPF and XPG (xeroderma pigmentosum groups F and G), position themselves precisely on each side of the lesion and act as molecular scissors to cut out the damaged segment of DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the lesion is removed, new DNA is synthesized to fill in the gap left behind. Finally, the DNA backbone is sealed, and the damaged DNA is restored back to health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we want to know is how the PInC forms after the lesion scanning phase," Ivanov said. "How does it control the positioning of the two enzyme subunits that perform the dual incision of the damaged DNA strand? And importantly, is there any cross talk between the two enzymes? Do they sense each other?"&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;"That matters because once the damaged DNA strand is cleaved, it's vital that the repair process is completed by filling in that gap," he added. "Otherwise, it will lead to cell death or to the introduction of double-stranded breaks, which are extremely harmful to the cell."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answering those questions required the researchers to solve the structure of the PInC. In biology, understanding protein structure is essential for understanding the behavior or function of protein assemblies. The shapes, sizes and interactions of proteins determine how they fit together to form large biomolecular assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We integrated the structural model of PInC using data from a variety of biophysical techniques, notably cryo-electron microscopy," Ivanov said. "But in the end, the computation is what puts everything together."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, the PInC model had to be assembled from known structures of constituent proteins, and all the individual pieces had to be put together in 3D. However, many of the PInC components had no known experimental structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome this challenge, the researchers used a neural network-based model called AlphaFold2 to predict the unknown structures and the interfaces between the proteins that hold PInC together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Summit's final simulations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Computationally, once you assemble the PInC, molecular dynamics simulations of the complex become relatively straightforward, especially on large supercomputers like Summit," Ivanov said.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics, or NAMD, is a molecular dynamics code specifically designed for supercomputers and is used to simulate the movements and interactions of large biomolecular systems that contain millions of atoms. Using NAMD, the research team ran extensive simulations. The number-crunching power of the 200-petaflop Summit supercomputer—capable of performing 200,000 trillion calculations per second—was essential in unraveling the functional dynamics of the PInC complex on a timescale of microseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The simulations showed us a lot about the complex nature of the PInC machinery. It showed us how these different components move together as modules and the subdivision of this complex into dynamic communities, which form the moving parts of this machine," Ivanov said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings are significant in that mutations in XPF and XPG can lead to severe human genetic disorders. They include xeroderma pigmentosum, which is a condition that makes people more susceptible to skin cancer, and Cockayne syndrome, which can affect human growth and development, lead to impaired hearing and vision, and speed up the aging process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Simulations allow us to zero in on these important regions because mutations that interfere with the function of the NER complex often occur at community interfaces, which are the most dynamic regions of the machine," Ivanov said. "Now we have a much better understanding of how and from where these disorders manifest."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the molecular dynamics simulations were performed on Summit. However, after 6 years of production, Summit was retired at the end of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

																																			&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Ivanov and his team plan to use Summit's successor, Frontier, the exascale-class supercomputer that debuted as the world's most powerful supercomputer when it came online in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their work on Frontier will involve examining transcription-coupled NER, which is a DNA repair process that fixes damage in actively transcribed genes to ensure that essential proteins can continue being made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Ivanov, the research team includes Jina Yu, Chunli Yan, Tanmoy Paul and Lucas Brewer at Georgia State University; Susan E. Tsutakawa and John A. Tainer at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Chi-Lin Tsai at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center; and Samir M. Hamdan at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology.&lt;/p&gt;

The study underscores that dementia and cognitive decline share risk factors with heart disease, suggesting these conditions are largely preventable by managing diet, exercise, cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following guidelines such as the American Heart Association’s Life Essential 8—eight essential behaviors to improve cardiovascular and brain health—can significantly lower the risk of developing dementia. Experts argue that integrating these heart-healthy habits into everyday life offers a practical strategy for reducing the growing global burden of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Risk Factors:&lt;/strong&gt; Dementia and heart disease share common modifiable risk factors, such as diet, blood pressure, and cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rising Burden:&lt;/strong&gt; Globally, dementia cases have risen 160% since 1990, outpacing cardiovascular disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventative Strategies:&lt;/strong&gt; Adopting the American Heart Association’s “Life Essential 8” could significantly protect brain health and reduce dementia risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AHA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average adult brain only weighs about 3 pounds, yet it is one of the most complex and vital organs of the human body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognition may decline and our brains become prone to disease as we age, so as medical advances and other factors help the world’s population live longer the prevalence of brain disease, including dementia, is on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, keeping our brains healthy may be easier than people realize with some helpful guidance from the American Heart Association, a global force changing the future of health of all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108135"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a brain in the shape of a heart." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Elkind said following the American Heart Association’s Life Essential 8™ can be as beneficial for brain health as it is for heart health. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimal brain health includes the functional ability to perform all the diverse tasks for which the brain is responsible – including thinking, moving and feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many modifiable risk factors for cognitive loss, such as an unhealthy diet and sedentary lifestyle, develop as early as childhood and adolescence. As we age, our ability to remember, problem-solve, think and communicate decreases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We now know that many of the same health risk factors that cause heart disease and stroke also contribute to a decline in overall brain health,” said Mitchell S. V. Elkind, M.D., M.S., FAHA, a neurologist and former volunteer American Heart Association president and currently its chief clinical science officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just like with heart disease and stroke, most brain disease is preventable. However, the combination of an aging population and projected substantial increases in high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes are likely to lead to unprecedented growth in many types of brain disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to data reported in the &lt;em&gt;2025 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics: A Report of U.S. and Global Data From the American Heart Association&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; leading cause of death in the U.S. and the leading cause of death among all neurological disorders, including stroke.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More females than males die of dementia each year because of the higher prevalence of elderly females compared with males. Females accounted for 66.7% of U.S. dementia deaths in 2022.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More than 6.9 million people in the U.S. are living with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An analysis of Medicare data reported in the update estimates that prevalence will more than double to 13.9 million Americans by 2060.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also reported in the statistical update:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, nearly 57 million people had Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias in 2021, a 45% increase since 2010 and a 160% increase over the past 30 years (1990-2021). For comparison, the prevalence of cardiovascular disease increased 33% over the past decade and 111% over the past 30 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The increase in global deaths from Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias is outpacing that of cardiovascular disease even more – dementia deaths increased by nearly 195% since 1990, compared to a 57% increase in cardiovascular deaths during that same time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Estimated U.S. healthcare spending on dementia more than doubled from $38.6 billion in 1996 to $79.2 billion in 2016. Spending on dementias was among the top 10 healthcare costs in the United States in 2016.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The burden of brain disorders is high. Dementia as a cause of death is growing faster than any other disease, including heart disease, the number one cause of death worldwide. Paradoxically, as we get better at treating other conditions, like heart disease, stroke and cancer, dementia as a cause of death increases,” Elkind said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using many of the same tools and information that have helped us successfully address cardiovascular risk factors and reduce the burden of heart disease over the past several decades, we should be able to do the same for brain disorders and promote brain health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elkind said following the American Heart Association’s Life Essential 8™ can be as beneficial for brain health as it is for heart health. These include 4 health behaviors and 4 health factors identified as key measures for improving and maintaining cardiovascular health:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health Behaviors: Eat Better&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health Behaviors: Be More Active&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health Behaviors: Quit Tobacco&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health Behaviors: Get Healthy Sleep&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health Factors: Manage Weight&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health Factors: Control Cholesterol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health Factors: Manage Blood Sugar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health Factors: Manage Blood Pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The American Heart Association is committed to advancing brain science through innovative research that will help scientists shed new light on the causes and contributors to cognitive impairment and dementia, particularly as it relates to heart and vascular health,” Elkind said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, we can support individuals and communities in thinking of brain health not only in terms of an absence of disease, but also in a more positive way. We can look at how we optimize brain function to include positive cognitive traits like creativity, adaptability, resilience, empathy and others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the increasing cost of poor brain health in lives and dollars makes the Association’s ongoing commitment to better understand how brains age and how vascular health impacts brain health and overall well-being even more imperative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When people are asked what health conditions they fear the most with aging, dementia tops the list, surpassing even cancer, heart disease and stroke,” Elkind said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s critical that as a society and as individuals we understand and make the changes needed to improve health outcomes from brain disease and, more importantly, prevent them to begin with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this brain health and longevity research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1172706579683f7d746678625179747063653f7e6376" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cathy Lewis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://heart.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;AHA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Cathy Lewis – AHA&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 21:20:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE9UTEV0TklkUFY4NHJXWXRqanpzNHdkWnZJTjhWVjhkTFh3NEtvQ0FxbmRCd2ZHcnVkbWFIYzI3SF9UVDljZ09vVDlJUlc1RjY4TFM5YTFtRTZMZkNUbHgxbURwR2ZRVW9fdjZxWFlUNGFKdw</guid></item><item><title>Brains Use Social Shortcuts to Master Complex Group Dynamics - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE55aWczcDF5Umx1dVFSU1N3OTdNVHFuYzFRZVR0ZVNGQXpYSU1hM05MM0pYQmRWRFcwUC1BNGpXU0lQYlM1MG1rVng0R0t3bnh6bU9VejlqN1oxdGFwaThkOF9xek8yakNBTFhBNktmMV9CZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research reveals that our brains simplify complex social interactions by using basic mental “building blocks” or shortcuts. Researchers scanned the brains of people playing a simple team game and observed how participants kept track of interactions with both teammates and opponents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than monitoring each individual separately, the brain creates simplified patterns that capture the essential dynamics of group behavior, particularly in the prefrontal cortex—an area important for decision-making and social skills. These findings help explain how we efficiently manage and interpret the constant flood of social information encountered daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Shortcuts:&lt;/strong&gt; Our brains use simplified mental patterns to manage complex social interactions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Tracking:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain simultaneously tracks both individual players and the sequence of their interactions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prefrontal Cortex Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Specific brain activity in the prefrontal cortex encodes simplified social interaction patterns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our brains use basic ‘building blocks’ of information to keep track of how people interact, enabling us to navigate complex social interactions, finds a new study led by University College London (UCL) researchers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers scanned the brains of participants who were playing a simple game involving a teammate and two opponents, to see how their brains were able to keep track of information about the group of players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108130"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and puzzle pieces." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers say these fundamental building blocks appear to represent patterns of interaction that are common to many different situations. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that rather than keeping track of the performance of each individual player, specific parts of the participants’ brains would react to specific patterns of interaction, or ‘building blocks’ of information that could be combined to understand what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Dr Marco Wittmann (UCL Psychology &amp;amp; Language Sciences and Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research) said: “Humans are social creatures that are capable of keeping track of highly complex and fluid social dynamics, requiring a massive amount of brain power to remember not only individual people but also the various relationships between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In order to keep up with a group social interaction in real time, our brains must be using heuristics – mental shortcuts that help people make decisions quickly – to compress and simplify the wealth of information involved, with a system that minimises complexity while still allowing flexibility and detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this research, we found that our brains appear to use a set of basic ‘building blocks’ that represent fundamental aspects of social interactions, enabling us to quickly figure out new and complex social situations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, the team of scientists from UCL and the University of Oxford used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to record the brain activity of 88 participants who were playing a simple game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While in the scanner, the study participants were given a series of information about how they, a partner, and their opponents were faring in a game, and needed to keep track of the information in order to answer a question comparing performances of different players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Wittmann explained: “We were interested to see whether our brains would use an ‘agent-centric’ frame of reference where specific parts of the brain keep track of each player’s performance, or a ‘sequential’ frame of reference tracking the information in the order it was received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that people actually do both, but our brains are able to simplify all of this information into bite-sized chunks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists were able to pinpoint specific patterns of activity in the brain that represented a few specific ‘building blocks’, each representing a pattern of interaction between the players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, one building block kept information about how well a participant and their partner were doing relative to the other team. A bigger difference in performance between the two teams corresponded to an increase in brain activity related to this building block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These specific patterns of activity were found in the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in decision-making and social behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers say these fundamental building blocks appear to represent patterns of interaction that are common to many different situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Wittmann said: “As we develop social skills in life, our brains are likely learning specific interaction patterns that we come across again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These patterns may become hard-wired into our brains as building blocks that get assembled and recombined to construct our understanding of any social setting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this social neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#27444f554e54094b4649426752444b09464409524c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chris Lane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucl.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Chris Lane – UCL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08705-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Basis functions for complex social decisions in dorsomedial frontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;” by Marco Wittmann et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basis functions for complex social decisions in dorsomedial frontal cortex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navigating social environments is a fundamental challenge for the brain. It has been established that the brain solves this problem, in part, by representing social information in an agent-centric manner; knowledge about others’ abilities or attitudes is tagged to individuals such as ‘oneself’ or the ‘other’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This intuitive approach has informed the understanding of key nodes in the social parts of the brain, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the patterns or combinations in which individuals might interact with one another is as important as the identities of the individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, in four studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging, behavioural experiments and a social group decision-making task, we show that the dmPFC and ACC represent the combinatorial possibilities for social interaction afforded by a given situation, and that they do so in a compressed format resembling the basis functions used in spatial, visual and motor domains. The basis functions align with social interaction types, as opposed to individual identities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results indicate that there are deep analogies between abstract neural coding schemes in the visual and motor domain and the construction of our sense of social identity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 21:10:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE55aWczcDF5Umx1dVFSU1N3OTdNVHFuYzFRZVR0ZVNGQXpYSU1hM05MM0pYQmRWRFcwUC1BNGpXU0lQYlM1MG1rVng0R0t3bnh6bU9VejlqN1oxdGFwaThkOF9xek8yakNBTFhBNktmMV9CZw</guid></item><item><title>CDC’s reported study on vaccines and autism could test RFK Jr.’s pledges to a key senator - STAT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxOdGZSREZBLUR1Z0NENTZobWQyQ1dVTHg5RWh0b01yTkd0bUFCUlZVU25XT0dDZzJTSkNLOHc4VlJGVXB4Umg0R0p5aS04dkpBNy1PbVp3d0dnVHM0YUhyRjMydUNpR1ZRNm1NN1JBSlRTUTVPa1UwRGlnaXZtZ2cwWFNzOVE4dlhLMnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports of a new federal plan to study whether there’s a link between vaccines and autism could serve as an early test of the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/04/rfk-jr-confirmation-vote-analysis-hard-line-on-vaccines-gop-senators-warn-trump-hhs-nominee/"&gt;commitments Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) said he received&lt;/a&gt; from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in exchange for his support for RFK Jr.’s confirmation as Health and Human Services secretary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Friday, multiple news outlets reported that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was planning the study. Cassidy said last week that such a study would be a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/05/trump-nih-nominee-jay-bhattacharya-confirmation-research-on-vaccines-autism/"&gt;waste of time and money&lt;/a&gt;, because research has already shown there’s no link.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When he backed Kennedy’s confirmation, one of the commitments Cassidy said he received was a pledge to keep communication lines wide open and to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/13/rfk-vote-hhs-secretary-how-kennedy-moved-from-fringe-to-center-of-power/"&gt;consult Cassidy on vaccine policy&lt;/a&gt;. And yet, when Cassidy was asked Tuesday for his reaction to the reports, he said he’s not even sure the agency truly intends to run such a study. &lt;/p&gt;

But some detractors attribute the clearing of skin simplyto an increase in water intake and overall hydration—something that also naturally aids with digestion, constipation, and energy. And though &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24930587/" target="_blank"&gt;a 2014 study&lt;/a&gt; on the clinical efficacy of chlorophyll used for acne treatment did find a reduction in acne and sebum levels, it was with the use of &lt;i class=" "&gt;topical &lt;/i&gt;chlorophyllin, not an oral supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“Supplement makers claim that chlorophyll can do many things, but few of the claims are backed by scientific evidence,” says Surampudi. Research surrounding what chlorophyll actually does to the body is very limited, with many of the existing studies done on animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;Can you have too much chlorophyll?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Naturally occurring chlorophyll from plants isn’t considered harmful to humans, even in large amounts. Experts generally recommend anywhere from 100 mg to 300 mg of liquid chlorophyllin per day for adults, but more studies are needed to determine if this is a truly effective dose in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“Since the FDA does not regulate supplements, it is difficult to know upper limits,” says Surampudi.  “Chlorophyllin supplements can have side effects, including gastrointestinal issues, skin reactions, and allergic reactions.” While they are generally considered safe, she stresses that it’s important to consult with a healthcare professional before taking any new supplements. Additionally, there has been no research on the safety of chlorophyllin on women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;Going the natural route&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;If you’re still chlorophyll curious, you can get your intake by simply eating your greens. Foods high in chlorophyll include spinach, collard greens, mustard greens, alfalfa, parsley, green cabbage, asparagus, chlorella, and spirulina. In addition to these foods, it’s generally important to eat a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables as part of a healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>National Geographic</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 21:00:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxQZVJRM2dicHJtMUxtMHRGM3ozZjZCZ09Gc2E0MzctVXIzcDczSUd4TTRXcklJakJDcHdwRzJEemcxZm45Y25raHVDSnJobVlsdlNrVnp5emRIMmJxZ09DU3l1cE9sU05KU2pWbExBUklCRDBfczMyUzNpUml0NVliTVhRX3U3eFZzcTg3ckdR</guid></item><item><title>Scientists find natural molecule that works like Ozempic - NewsNation Now</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE1DUDhRbExzSGdxZTVobFgteG1USDF0VFZtOWtZVXJuc0lxQTdZRzQ0Yl9OMV9RUml0RlkyazkxME52RmdZV0ZsbWp2Rl9RSU03MGJfM2x1QWFVOUpBZTNtcjNscERMQlBnVzNnZEFsUdIBdEFVX3lxTE5ZNVRPTEpqZHZkQVVSS3dMSWcxeWRsZlJmMkROUEUxQjBYa055ZEdaTkttc1QtWG1Rd19LX3NtcU9qUUhUUzQ3V0Fjc3N5dVQwZ3c3MzBRRjIzQURUc1FXWDVzaHhjT2NTV3R0Nk92bmNWS0E1?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;
