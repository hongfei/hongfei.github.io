Maybe it's financial problems, relationship issues, or personal pain, but they often walk through life feeling alone. While their behaviors indicate there's a problem, their words sometimes speak louder. Whether it's saying they don't care or acting like they're busy, if someone says any of these phrases casually, they're struggling more than they want to admit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It isn't always obvious when our loved ones are going through things, but there will sometimes be telltale signs. It could be their tone of voice or dismissive words, but it's up to us to pay close attention. Because when a person is struggling, they may be crying out for help and their words will fall on deaf ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If someone says any of these 11 phrases casually, they're struggling more than they want to admit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. 'I'm fine'&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-09/someone-says-phrases-casually-struggling-admit-i%27m-fine.png" alt="man telling friend he's fine but secretly struggling" title="if someone says any of these phrases casually they're struggling more than they want to admit i'm fine" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;loreanto | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone says "I'm fine" casually, they're struggling more than they want to admit. It's unfortunate, but most people who are struggling won't reveal that their mental health is in decline. Filled with guilt and shame, they'd rather cover it up by telling others they are fine, but this can be dangerous and hurtful to those who care about them most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if they don't see it, their loved ones have a strong desire to connect and be vulnerable with each other. As the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6125010/" rel="nofollow"&gt;American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine&lt;/a&gt; reiterated, "Humans are wired to connect, and this connection affects our health." So, while it might be tempting to push their feelings to the side, speaking to someone has a big impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/people-who-seem-they-have-their-life-together-often-hide-these-struggles"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People Who Seem Like They Have Their Life Together Often Hide These 11 Struggles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2.

As a result, they may shrug and give up. But if someone says "it is what it is," they're struggling more than they want to admit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loved ones might be upset to hear it, but those dealing with mental or emotional health issues may not see it as a big deal. Maybe they were taught to just suck it up and deal with it, or are so tired of trying that they have nothing left to give.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holding everything in might make someone feel more isolated in the long run, causing them to pull away. But talking to loved ones can help and &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/most-powerful-phrase-for-someone-struggling"&gt;provide a safe space to open up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/subtle-habits-tell-other-people-everything-they-need-know-about-you"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8 Subtle Habits That Tell Other People Everything They Need To Know About You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3.

But when someone uses their tiredness as an excuse to avoid doing certain things, like socializing with friends or taking care of their daily responsibilities, it's not a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are struggling are shutting themselves out from seeking help, making their mental health issues worse. And according to a &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691614568352" rel="nofollow"&gt;study published in Perspectives on Psychological Science&lt;/a&gt;, loneliness and social isolation are twice as harmful to someone's physical and mental health as obesity is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/truly-smart-people-usually-avoid-anyone-who-does-these-things"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Truly Smart People Usually Avoid Anyone Who Does These 11 Things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4.

Due to their pure exhaustion, they may admit they don't care anymore, even if internally they're not doing well. Because despite how nonchalant they want to be, deep down inside, they're hurting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, due to their stubborn nature, it might be nearly impossible to have a one-on-one conversation about how they actually feel. So used to being closed off, they keep a lid on their emotions until they eventually explode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/wellness/proven-techniques-healing-brain-wound-humans-experience-trauma"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 Proven Techniques For Healing The 'Brain Wound' Humans Experience From Trauma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5.

Like clockwork, they'll compare their issues to someone who is seemingly struggling more than them, downplaying their own pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just because it isn't as severe as someone else's plight, doesn't make it any less important. As one &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fpas0001155" rel="nofollow"&gt;study from Psychological Assessment&lt;/a&gt; found, people who invalidate their own emotions feel more upset and are more readily activated emotionally.

Whether it's from embarrassment or guilt, a person saying they don't want to talk about it is likely suffering in silence. It isn't always their intention to &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/things-people-hide-their-feelings-understand"&gt;shut people out or hide their emotions&lt;/a&gt;, but it might come from a place of fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, just because it's hard doesn't mean they should give up. Even if it's something small like journaling their thoughts, actively finding a way to vent is the best way to figure out what to say or, at the very least, get those emotions out in a healthy and productive way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/habits-quietly-successful-people-miserable-people-overlook"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 Habits Of Quietly Successful People That Miserable Folks Always Overlook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7.

Because the truth is, it does matter to them, they just don't want to express it for one reason or another. Perhaps they don't want to feel like a burden or are prone to overthinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And according to &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-mind-body-link/202504/the-hidden-cost-of-overthinking"&gt;psychologist Kyle Davies&lt;/a&gt;, "When we're constantly second-guessing or trying to outthink our emotions, we become disconnected from the deeper signals of clarity, insight, and instinct that reside within us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, it's their choice whether they want to share or not. Despite venting being good for their mental health, those who struggle will always do things on their own terms, despite it harming them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/money/people-who-never-struggle-financially-avoid-these-everyday-habits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People Who Never Struggle Financially Avoid These 11 Everyday Habits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8.

Despite how difficult the obstacle may be, they can't always depend on others to save them. But this doesn't mean they have to shut everyone out completely. Even if they can't always help, at the very least, people can offer the support needed to keep moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who don't bother asking for help are always going to struggle the most. Even if they can do it all on their own, isolation and the feeling of helplessness are only intensified when they shut down. This is why it's important to let people in. Because nobody does anything alone and comes out the other end successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/notice-things-someones-house-struggling-more-they-admit"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If You Notice These 11 Things At Someone's House, They're Struggling More Than They Admit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9.

They were told that no matter how difficult life got, there was plenty to be grateful for. And while this might have been said with the best of intentions, never complaining isn't healthy. Holding everything in is bound to mess with a person's mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-addiction-connection/202312/how-to-stop-intellectualizing-your-emotions"&gt;clinical psychologist Rubin Khoddam&lt;/a&gt; explained, "&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/not-so-subtle-signs-you-might-be-intellectualizer"&gt;Intellectualizing emotions is a defense mechanism&lt;/a&gt; that serves as a shield against the overwhelming intensity of feelings. It's the process of suppressing emotions by overthinking, analyzing, or explaining them away. It can be rooted in our upbringing, societal expectations, or personal coping strategies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/simple-daily-tasks-feel-impossible-when-body-stuck-fight-flight-mode"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Simple Daily Tasks That Feel Impossible When Your Body Is Stuck In 'Fight-Or-Flight' Mode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10.

So, they choose to portray everything as just fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While they might not see anything wrong with this, shutting out others is hurtful. After all, feeling abandoned can hurt just about anyone's feelings. Does this mean people have to open up completely? No, but simply saying, "I'm going through something, but I'd rather not talk about it now" is a lot better than keeping them in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/tiny-ways-people-can-tell-you-didnt-shower-even-when-try-freshen-up"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Tiny Ways People Can Tell You Didn't Shower, Even When You Try To Freshen Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;11.

							&lt;p data-start="432" data-end="555"&gt;It’s funny—some of the things younger generations teased boomers about actually turn out to have serious health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="557" data-end="755"&gt;Science has been catching up with common sense in the last few decades, and research now shows that several of the hobbies boomers grew up with—or never let go of—are directly linked to longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="757" data-end="958"&gt;These aren’t high-tech, expensive pursuits. They’re everyday activities, woven into life without fanfare. And maybe that’s the point: the stuff that really sustains us isn’t flashy, it’s sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="960" data-end="982"&gt;Let’s get into them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="989" data-end="1006"&gt;1. Gardening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1008" data-end="1098"&gt;Ever wonder why so many boomers spent their weekends pruning roses or planting tomatoes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1100" data-end="1410"&gt;Turns out, gardening isn’t just about curb appeal or homegrown produce. Studies link it to lower stress, better immune function, and reduced risk of dementia. Digging in the dirt exposes us to microbes that boost serotonin. Plus, gardening keeps you moving in a low-impact way that’s sustainable for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1412" data-end="1595"&gt;One meta-analysis found that gardening interventions had &lt;a href="https://systematicreviewsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13643-024-02457-9?.com"&gt;a moderate positive effect on well-being&lt;/a&gt; and mental health across multiple studies. It’s a habit that feeds both the body and the mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1597" data-end="1919"&gt;I’ve noticed this myself when I tend to my balcony plants. Even just ten minutes with my hands in soil resets my stress levels. The quiet focus of pruning leaves feels a lot like meditation—but with tomatoes at the end of it. If you’ve got a yard—or even a few pots—you’ve got a built-in therapy session waiting for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1926" data-end="1941"&gt;2. Walking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1943" data-end="2029"&gt;Boomers walked. A lot. They didn’t think of it as exercise—it was just part of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2031" data-end="2373"&gt;Now, science says it’s one of the best predictors of healthy aging. Walking improves cardiovascular health, supports bone density, and even sharpens memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2031" data-end="2373"&gt;A 2022 genetic study of over 400,000 participants found that brisk walkers had significantly longer telomeres—and suggested that walking faster could&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/04/220420133538.htm?.com"&gt; slow biological aging&lt;/a&gt; by the equivalent of about 16 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2375" data-end="2651"&gt;The beauty of walking is its accessibility. You don’t need gear or a gym membership. Just shoes and time. It’s also underrated as a creativity booster. Steve Jobs was famous for his walking meetings, and research backs up the idea that &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/xlm-a0036577.pdf?.com"&gt;walking helps with divergent thinking.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2653" data-end="2878"&gt;I learned this on a trip to Japan when I joined an older local group on their morning walk. Their energy was contagious, and it hit me: this is a habit you can keep doing well into your eighties. No extreme workouts needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2885" data-end="2905"&gt;3. Volunteering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2907" data-end="3002"&gt;Many boomers made volunteering a staple—whether at church, the library, or community centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3004" data-end="3208"&gt;Research shows that giving your time doesn’t just help others; it extends your own life. People who volunteer regularly have lower mortality rates, better mental health, and a stronger sense of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3210" data-end="3421"&gt;One prospective study found that adults over 50 who volunteered at least 200 hours per year were about &lt;a href="https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/3804225?.com"&gt;40 % less likely to develop hypertension. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3423" data-end="3669"&gt;Purpose is medicine. And volunteering gives it in spades. It satisfies the psychological need for relatedness, something self-determination theory highlights as essential for well-being. In other words, helping others reminds us that we belong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3676" data-end="3712"&gt;4. Playing cards or board games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3714" data-end="3799"&gt;Friday night poker nights, bridge clubs, Scrabble marathons. Boomers swore by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3801" data-end="4078"&gt;Now science confirms that regularly playing games protects against cognitive decline. Social interaction plus strategy keeps neural pathways firing. In a French prospective cohort (the Paquid study), regular board game players had about &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/8/e002998?.com"&gt;15 % lower risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt; over 20 years compared to non-players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4080" data-end="4321"&gt;Games do something else too: they create shared rituals. That weekly bridge night isn’t just entertainment—it’s community plus mental exercise. The anticipation of the game, the inside jokes, even the competition—all of it feeds longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4323" data-end="4532"&gt;I’ve mentioned this before, but when I lived in Spain for a summer, I saw older folks gather nightly in plazas to play dominoes. They weren’t just passing time—they were literally keeping their brains alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4539" data-end="4554"&gt;5. Dancing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4556" data-end="4648"&gt;If you’ve ever been dragged to a boomer wedding, you’ve seen the electric slide in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4650" data-end="4938"&gt;Beyond the cheesy moves, dancing is insanely good for you. It combines aerobic activity, balance training, and social connection. Studies show that dancing lowers the risk of heart disease and improves brain health. Some even suggest it &lt;a href="https://montefioreeinstein.org/news/2023/01/05/social-dancing-improve-cognition-reduce-alzheimers-risk?.com"&gt;reduces the likelihood of developing Alzheimer’s.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4940" data-end="5174"&gt;Neurologists point out that dancing challenges the brain in unique ways: you have to coordinate movement, remember steps, and often improvise in rhythm with others. That blend of physical and mental effort is rare outside of sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5176" data-end="5359"&gt;Plus—it’s fun. Unlike forcing yourself onto a treadmill, dancing makes exercise feel like joy. No surprise it triggers dopamine release, which is linked to motivation and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5366" data-end="5389"&gt;6. Cooking at home&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5391" data-end="5445"&gt;Boomers weren’t eating out every night. They cooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5447" data-end="5652"&gt;Science backs this habit big time. Home-cooked meals tend to be healthier, with fewer processed ingredients and less sodium. Cooking also engages creativity and gives a sense of control over your health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5654" data-end="5882"&gt;One study found that people in Taiwan and Australia who cooked up to five times a week had &lt;a href="https://www.bluezones.com/2018/04/want-to-eat-better-and-live-longer-learn-to-cook/?.com"&gt;a 47 % greater chance of being alive ten years later.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5884" data-end="6157"&gt;I still remember my grandmother teaching me how to make lentil stew. At the time, I thought it was just food. Now I realize it was one of the healthiest “hobbies” she could have passed down. Cooking ties health with tradition, creating a kind of resilience you can taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6164" data-end="6179"&gt;7. Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6181" data-end="6287"&gt;Bookshelves lined with novels, biographies, or how-to guides—that was a common boomer household feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6289" data-end="6501"&gt;Reading isn’t just entertainment. It boosts empathy, reduces stress, and improves brain connectivity. A 2016 Yale study found that people who read books regularly&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953616303689?.com"&gt; lived almost two years longer&lt;/a&gt; than non-readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6503" data-end="6679"&gt;Books are also a powerful way to practice “deep focus” in a world that constantly interrupts us. That immersion strengthens attention span, which is protective for the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6681" data-end="6978"&gt;Personally, I find that reading grounds me in a way scrolling never could. I’ll pick up a behavioral science book and suddenly lose hours, not because I’m distracted but because I’m absorbed. That kind of focus is becoming rare—and it might be one of the healthiest mental workouts we have left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6985" data-end="7024"&gt;8. Bowling and other social sports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7026" data-end="7097"&gt;Bowling leagues were a thing. So were golf groups and softball teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7099" data-end="7357"&gt;At first glance, they seem like just casual fun. But social sports combine three powerful life-extending elements: movement, community, and routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7099" data-end="7357"&gt;One longitudinal study found that higher diversity in social activities (e.g. clubs, groups, sports) was linked to &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/79/5/gbae021/7609169?&amp;amp;login=false"&gt;lower mortality risk&lt;/a&gt; even after adjusting for health and activity frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7099" data-end="7357"&gt;The game matters less than the connection. Whether you’re rolling strikes or gutter balls, you’re winning at health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7479" data-end="7817"&gt;What fascinates me is how these activities create “third places”—spaces outside home and work where people gather. Sociologists argue these places are essential for community health, and boomers knew this instinctively. A bowling alley wasn’t just about pins. It was about friendship, laughter, and rituals that kept people coming back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7824" data-end="7843"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7845" data-end="7946"&gt;The hobbies that keep us alive aren’t flashy. They’re simple, social, and woven into everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7948" data-end="8132"&gt;Boomers didn’t need wearables or biohacking apps to tell them what felt good. They trusted habits that gave them connection, movement, and purpose. And now the science backs them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8134" data-end="8251"&gt;So the next time you’re tempted to dismiss a “boomer pastime,” maybe lean in. It might just add years to your life.&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/div&gt;

The destination is &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/alpha-centauri-triple-star-system-about-4-light-years-from-earth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alpha Centauri&lt;/a&gt;, about 25 trillion miles from Earth, a distance that rules out resupply once the ship leaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan treats the vessel as a closed society that must feed itself, educate children, care for the sick, and manufacture what it needs while coasting between stars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It proposes layered habitats for farms, homes, schools, industry, and storage, all made livable by rotation that supplies gravity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-chrysalis-plan"&gt;The Chrysalis plan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i4is.org/who-we-are/board-of-directors/#gsc.tab=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr Andreas Hein&lt;/a&gt; is executive director of the Initiative for Interstellar Studies (&lt;a href="https://i4is.org/"&gt;I4IS&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group convened experts to see whether architecture, engineering, and social systems could be woven into a practical multi-century mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team behind Chrysalis proposes a long training phase on Earth. Early generations would live in isolated Antarctic stations for 70 to 80 years to build the habits, culture, and mental resilience needed for life off planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chrysalis uses a nested shell layout around a central spine. Inner-zones grow plants, fungi, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/living-microbes-found-sealed-inside-2-billion-year-old-rock/"&gt;microbes&lt;/a&gt;, insects, and some livestock in controlled farms, mid layers hold parks, clinics, schools, and libraries, and outer shells host workshops and storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dwellings sit between community space and light industry to keep daily life close to work and services. The outermost storehouse would be robot heavy to cut human labor and risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alpha-centauri-and-proxima-b"&gt;Alpha Centauri and Proxima b&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alpha Centauri is the nearest star system, which shortens the voyage by every realistic metric. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The likely landing zone is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Proxima Centauri b&lt;/a&gt;, an Earth-size exoplanet reported to orbit in a temperate zone that could allow liquid water under some conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the ship enters the system, shuttles housed in the central core would ferry crews and equipment to the planet. The design treats that arrival as the beginning of settlement rather than the end of the mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal aims to arrive with full knowledge systems, from agriculture to medicine to materials science. It assumes no external logistics, so onboard manufacturing and repair are treated as basic survival needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-artificial-gravity-and-health"&gt;Artificial gravity and health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chrysalis relies on artificial gravity from steady rotation to keep bodies closer to Earth normal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://technology.nasa.gov/patent/TOP2-311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rotation-based gravity&lt;/a&gt; is a studied countermeasure for cardiovascular and musculoskeletal deconditioning, as summarized in a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2018.00716/full"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; that evaluated centrifuge experiments in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spin introduces tradeoffs like &lt;a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/tutorial_currents/04currents1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Coriolis effects&lt;/a&gt; that can disturb balance if rotation is too fast. The nested layout helps tune spin and radius so living areas feel stable while still providing adequate effective gravity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiation exposure is another core risk for a centuries long voyage. The concept leans on structure and materials, using mass in the habitat shells to reduce particle flux rather than relying only on specialized shields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health care sits in the communal layer near schools and parks to keep services accessible. That placement supports daily routines and reduces travel time for patients and caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chrysalis-power-and-propulsion"&gt;Chrysalis power and propulsion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For power and thrust, the team points to nuclear fusion as the long term energy source. Fusion plant concepts and timelines remain under &lt;a href="https://www.iaea.org/publications/15777/iaea-world-fusion-outlook-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;development&lt;/a&gt; and have been mapped and evaluated extensively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors propose a 20 to 25 year construction window once industry can deliver the required systems. They treat in-space manufacturing as a mission essential capability to replace worn parts and build upgrades during cruise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy production, recycling, and life support appear across multiple layers to avoid single points of failure. Heavy maintenance and logistics live at the outer edge where robots can operate with fewer human safety constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The population would be planned to hover near 1,500 to balance resources, education, and health. That cap sits below the ship’s maximum berth count to leave margin for emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-competitions-like-this-help"&gt;Why competitions like this help&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chrysalis won first place in the 2025 &lt;a href="https://www.projecthyperion.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;competition&lt;/a&gt;, and the jury praised both technical breadth and attention to people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chrysalis impressed the jury with its system-level coherence and innovative design of the modular habitat structure but also overall depth of detail,” wrote the Project Hyperion &lt;a href="https://www.projecthyperion.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;jury&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chrysalis is a living spaceship where humans, robots and artificial intelligent agents share information, experiences and decision-making processes,” stated the Chrysalis team, explaining that their starship was more than hardware. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We asked participants to integrate architecture, technology and social systems to conceptualise a functional society spanning centuries, and the outcome was beyond expectations,” said Dr Hein executive director of the &lt;a href="https://i4is.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Initiative for Interstellar Studies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concept work cannot replace flight hardware, yet it shapes the questions future engineers must answer. It also documents social and cultural choices that matter as much as engines when people live their whole lives off &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/earths-atmospheric-rivers-have-shifted-towards-the-poles-causing-big-local-weather-changes/"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-chrysalis-would-prepare-for-arrival"&gt;How Chrysalis would prepare for arrival&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core would carry compact shuttles sized for surface hops, cargo, and emergency evacuation. Pilots and maintenance crews would train during the cruise so landings do not depend on a single cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food systems would keep a mix of biomes, from tropical to boreal, to preserve biodiversity and stabilize diets. That diversity lowers the risk that one crop failure cascades across the whole &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ecosystem-attack-predicting-the-success-of-species-invasions/"&gt;ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowledge transfer shows up in how learning is embedded in daily life. Schools would be near labs, workshops, and farms so students practice skills early and keep them across generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governance would be transparent, with planned births, shared resources, and collaborative decision tools. The aim is to prevent shocks to a small population where every loss hurts community resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 01:19:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxPM2UxR1NrNUdFWlItWDFNYzJHSzBPLWUwWW02OS1LUWJ5LW9XOWdDbFdVTGF2UnYxRGtieXBQc3hxUkRWUGdZLWlfeUJsazFqVU1EU0E0REY3VHB1V0FwMWE2cmd4VXh5RFJSX2FQc1JNLWlZbklxaHJPdFdjU1ZqTk53NWZXaVRUMktkRFc1VzNIUzJuR2Fra0RLZ09UWDVVUTZQSmFGQjd2WV9GVmg3MjNUR04</guid></item><item><title>缓解膝盖疼痛并避免手术的六个简单步骤- dailymail.co.uk</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15139739/ease-knee-pain-avoid-surgery-six-steps.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When keen runner Jon Reeves, 54, began struggling to get down the stairs in the morning, he knew his knee pain was more than just sports injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The father of two from Oxfordshire had gone from daily runs and regular badminton matches to strapping up his inflamed joints and dosing himself on painkillers just to get through the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2020 doctors confirmed the cause: &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/osteoarthritis/index.html" id="mol-7df044a0-9ba6-11f0-ac66-c563bb30a77b" class=""&gt;osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt; – the degenerative joint disease that affects about ten million Britons. More than half of cases strike the knee, with 100,000 people a year ending up on the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-7dee96f0-9ba6-11f0-ac66-c563bb30a77b"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; waiting list for joint replacement surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Getting the diagnosis was devastating,’ says Jon. ‘I thought it was an old person’s disease and I was worried it would only get worse.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Initially prescribed anti-inflammatory drugs and exercises that were painful and brought little relief, Jon’s condition worsened until doctors warned him that he would need a double knee replacement. But by combining acupuncture, weight training and a Mediterranean-style diet, he was able to slash his pain level and postpone surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I am now managing amazingly – largely pain-free and back to hiking, swimming, cycling and long walks with my dalmatian Oscar,’ he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say thousands more like Jon could delay or even avoid surgery with simple lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jon Reeves was diagnosed wth osteoarthritis in 2020. By combining acupuncture, weight training and a Mediterranean-style diet, he slashed his pain level and postponed surgery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The degenerative joint disease affects about ten million Britons. More than half of cases strike the knee, with 100,000 people a year ending up on the NHS waiting list for joint replacement surgery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; Last week, Mail on Sunday columnist Dr Ellie Cannon wrote she was ‘worried that not enough osteoarthritis patients realise there are steps they can take to avoid knee replacement surgery’. In response she had a flood of letters and emails from readers sharing their own remedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One, Bill Ellis, 81, from Suffolk, who suffers from osteoarthritis in his knees, said a combination of supplements ‘has certainly made a difference in reducing my pain’ adding: ‘I also do 20 squats every other morning, not too deep I hasten to add, and it keeps the muscles stronger, which helps.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eddie Boyle, 77, from Bedfordshire, swears by capsaicin cream – which contains extracts from chillis – for reducing his pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So from diet swaps to supplements that work and exercises to ease the agony, here is the experts’ guide to managing the pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;1. FOLLOW THE MED DIET &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hailed as a key to longevity, a Mediterranean diet has also been shown to help reduce the symptoms of arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The eating style, common in Greece, Italy and Spain, is focused on fresh fruit and vegetables, fish and chicken, whole grains and olive oil, while cutting back on red meat and sweets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2016 study of more than 4,000 people with osteoarthritis in their knees found those who stuck most closely to the diet were significantly less likely to suffer crippling joint pain. They also scored better on overall physical health and showed fewer signs of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say the diet’s anti-inflammatory properties can help soothe swollen joints, while also protecting heart health and supporting weight control – two key risk factors for arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the Mediterranean diet won’t ‘cure’ osteoarthritis, scientists suggest it offers a simple, natural way to ease symptoms and improve day-to-day well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The Mediterranean diet can be really beneficial for patients,’ says Dr Wendy Holden, medical advisor for Arthritis Action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘A diet rich in fruit and veg as well as fish and whole grains, in addition to cutting down on ultra-processed foods, is key to cutting inflammation.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 2016 study of more than 4,000 people with osteoarthritis in their knees found those who stuck most closely to the Mediterranean diet were significantly less likely to suffer crippling joint pain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Protein intake is another crucial part of the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘From the age of 40 our muscle mass declines by 2 to 3 per cent per year, so we need to take in more protein from different sources in our diet – ideally at least 40 grams daily,’ says Dr Lucy Donaldson, Director of Research at Versus Arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This can be a challenge for many of us, but fortunately our research shows that an essential building block for protein called leucine – found in fish, nuts and legumes – is very potent at stimulating muscle protein levels, helping to maintain skeletal muscle.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other experts argue that the type of diet matters less than weight loss itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The real benefit to any diet, in relation to osteoarthritis symptoms, is maintaining a healthy weight,’ says Professor Philip Conaghan, an arthritis specialist at the University of Leeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This is because it reduces the load on the joints, which in turn eases pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But excess fat also drives inflammation, which makes symptoms worse.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research backs this up. Studies show weight loss reduces levels of inflammatory chemicals released by fat tissue, and can slow cartilage damage even in non-weight-bearing joints such as the hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anecdotally, doctors say patients who shed excess pounds often report less wrist or finger pain – clear evidence the benefits go beyond simply lightening the load on knees and hips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;2. TRY WEIGHT-LOSS JABS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mounting evidence suggests weight-loss injections may ease the pain of osteoarthritis – and in some cases this may be due to more than just losing excess fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For 54-year-old Sian Rios, who suffers from arthritis in her hip, a private prescription for Mounjaro has meant she can finally ditch her walking stick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before starting the jabs, the care home manager from Swindon was in such severe pain she was unable to walk more than a few metres. At night the throbbing pain would wake her repeatedly, leaving her exhausted and sleep-deprived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-e778e500-9bae-11f0-ac66-c563bb30a77b" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15139739/ease-knee-pain-avoid-surgery-six-steps.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;IT'S A FACT&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women are 40 per cent more likely to get knee osteoarthritis than men, with an increase in cases during menopause. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Four months on, she has shed six stone to weigh just over 17st.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I feel like it has given me my life back,’ says Sian. ‘Within weeks of using Mounjaro I was suffering from less pain, but now I very rarely have flare-ups and use pain relief far less often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I have lost a lot of weight since May, but what I have really gained is mobility, confidence and hope. I’ve gone from barely being able to walk to taking strolls around the lake. It’s night and day compared with the start of the year.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her hip replacement scheduled for later this year is now on hold thanks to her progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research backs her experience. A 2025 Taiwanese study of nearly 1,000 patients with osteoarthritis in knees found weight-loss injections reduced the risk of needing joint replacement surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Preliminary studies have suggested there is a benefit to weight-loss injections beyond just weight reduction,’ adds Dr Holden at Arthritis Action. ‘It appears they can help protect cartilage from wear and tear, slowing the progression of disease. The benefits are increasingly being reported by patients, and we are likely to see greater use of the drugs for arthritis going forwards.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently, however, arthritis is not included in the prescribing guidelines for weight-loss jabs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;3. BUILD STRENGTH FIRST&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say the key to managing osteoarthritis pain – and preventing it in the first place – is building strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Strictly Come Dancing star Joanne Clifton, 41, who was diagnosed with osteoarthritis in both knees in 2015, is one of those who credits strengthening exercises as preventing her from needing surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Philip Conaghan regularly sees patients aged 40 to 75 with knee, hip or other joint pain, and says muscle weakness is “almost universal”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His advice is simple: ‘First, get strong, then get fit. Just telling people to walk round the block is a bad starting point – because they are weak, they can’t walk at a brisk pace and they’re not getting any benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Strictly Come Dancing star Joanne Clifton, 41, was diagnosed with osteoarthritis in both knees in 2015, and credits strengthening exercises as preventing her from needing surgery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Once they’ve built some muscle strength, they can start on aerobic fitness, such as on an exercise bike or cross trainer, or swimming. Walking laps in a pool is a fabulous exercise for weak people.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He warns that difficulty undoing a jar, or struggling to get out of a chair or bath, are red flags – even before joint pain sets in – that muscles are weakening and putting too much strain on joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The benefits are clear. A review last year in the Annals of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine concluded there was ‘overwhelming evidence’ that strength training significantly reduces pain and improves function, performance and quality of life in people with knee and hip osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise works because joints depend on the network of muscles and tendons around them. Isaac Selby-Burton, a personal trainer who specialises in arthritis coaching, says: ‘It can be hard for people to take that initial step with exercises, because of the pain the condition causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I recommend starting with resistance bands, focusing on range of motion and muscles like the quads, which are vital for people with knee problems.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;4. USE ACUPUNCTURISTS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many patients swear by acupuncture to manage osteoarthritis pain, saying it allows them to do the strengthening exercises that bring long-term relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ancient Chinese therapy involves inserting fine needles into specific points in the body, and is said to encourage the release of natural pain-relieving chemicals, improve circulation and reduce stiffness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-08b1d6a0-9baf-11f0-ac66-c563bb30a77b" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15139739/ease-knee-pain-avoid-surgery-six-steps.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;IT'S A FACT&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have found evidence of osteoarthritis in dinosaur fossils, making it one of the oldest known diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The evidence is mixed, but growing. A review in 2025 of 18 studies involving 14,000 people found acupuncture was effective in reducing pain and improving function in osteoarthritis. Other research has shown modest short-term benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘For many people the pain of osteoarthritis has the greatest impact on their lives,’ says Dr Donaldson at Versus Arthritis. ‘Exercise can have very positive effects on pain but isn’t suitable for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Although National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines do not recommend acupuncture for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory forms of arthritis, we know many people living with chronic pain and inflammation use it. Our recent survey on complementary treatments found one in two people who tried acupuncture for arthritis reported some level of pain relief.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;5. USE SUPPLEMENTS THAT WORK&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients often swear by supplements to help ease arthritis pain – but experts say the evidence is thin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the most popular are turmeric (or sometimes just curcumin, the chemical compound that it contains), glucosamine sulphate (which is produced commercially from shellfish exoskeletons) and chondroitin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There is very little evidence to suggest that these supplements will help relieve osteoarthritis,’ says Dr Wendy Holden, medical advisor for Arthritis Action, who is also honorary consultant rheumatologist at Basingstoke and North Hampshire NHS Foundation trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The only two supplements with any evidence behind them are cod liver oil and rosehip&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The issue is that although the compounds themselves may have some benefit, supplements don’t usually contain enough of the key ingredient to make a real difference.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The only two supplements with any evidence behind them are cod liver oil and rosehip – though even here, results are mixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cod liver oil is rich in omega-3 oils, which are thought to have anti-inflammatory effects, but trials in osteoarthritis have generally failed to show clear benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rosehip powder – which is made from the seed pods of a rose bush – has shown more promise, with several small studies and reviews suggesting it can modestly reduce pain and stiffness, though the effects are limited and further research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;6. SPECIALIST BRACES CAN EASE SYMPTOMS &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specialist knee braces can also help to improve osteoarthritis symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2017 study followed 63 patients awaiting total knee replacement who were fitted with an ‘unloading’ or ‘offloading’ brace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After eight years, 40 per cent of those who had worn their brace consistently for two years said they no longer needed surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The brace, made of lightweight plastic and fabric, straps around the knee to apply a gentle sideways pull that helps realign the joint. A hinge on the side absorbs some of the downward force, reducing pressure and allowing patients to be more active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients in the trial initially wore the brace almost constantly, before using it selectively for activities needing extra support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who wore it for more than six months were half as likely to require surgery as those who gave up within three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The same model – the Unloader One, made by Icelandic company Ossur – has even been worn by TV star Ant McPartlin, 49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;McPartlin revealed he turned to it after his struggle with painkiller addiction following his ‘botched’ knee surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>dailymail.co.uk</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 00:32:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxPOUV4cENOblhOQjNSNWtQRWdtTjVnRFFrS1lXZnJROVRLWnNyV3hsS2F0RnhZSndjcFdPTlZ0RkpGbV9jTExwWTkwdWZVUThLTU42SjlRZ2VxUFhjbVJmQlRWTlZDOEJsc3NSTVpYX0NQTDNUZGswcHBXb3pXM1JHZHR6cndNMEEwMXdGeXByb2FwYVVCRXA3RUtCWQ</guid></item><item><title>N70,000艾滋病预防注射分裂尼日利亚人- Punch报纸</title><link>https://punchng.com/n70000-hiv-prevention-injection-splits-nigerians/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Punch Newspapers</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 00:25:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE55d0RQTWN3YVJ5LURqYVhSQTRYcnVJZS02TmhjTFZ6VHRzbjBNcWdMUnJXV01MOXFrUVcwSTdXY0xnbmFlUUJJakU5SUxhdXM2bVlZV2hCQUJocjIxTTFaVWltOHdLSnZiM0QwdVJENXpBZFJwME9HeA</guid></item><item><title>世界视网膜日：医生说，小习惯在保护你的视力方面每天都有很大的回报-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/world-retina-day-doctors-say-small-habits-pay-off-big-in-protecting-your-vision-daily/articleshow/124183315.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;World Retina Day is all about shining a light on the importance of eye health, specifically the retina, that tiny but mighty part at the back of your eye that makes clear vision possible. Without it, things like reading your favorite book, scrolling on your phone, or even recognizing faces would be a real struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;We at TOI spoke to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Yogesh Patil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Vitreo-Retina Surgeon, Dr Agarwals Eye Hospital, Sanpada; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Kalpana R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Senior Consultant, Ophthalmology, SIMS Hospital, Chennai; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Krishna Nagaradh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Vitreo - Retinal Consultant, Dr Agarwals Eye Hospital, Bengaluru on common retinal conditions and how to take care of retinal health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Nutrition for healthy eyes: Here's what doctor recommends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What are the most common retinal conditions you see today, and are cases increasing with lifestyle changes like screen time and diabetes?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Yogesh Patil: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age related vision changes are usually gradually progressive like needing reading glasses(presbyopia), scattering of light especially at night, taking longer time to adjust when going from bright to dark places, fluctuating vision. These are normal age related changes which can be treated with glasses, lubricant eye drops or better lighting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if vision changes are sudden in onset, asymmetric or associated with flashes, floaters, distortion or field loss are warning symptoms and are usually associated with Retina diseases. In such conditions an urgent dilated retinal check-up is needed with an expert. If proven Retina disease then it needs certain tests and immediate treatment as time is extremely crucial in these problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Krishna Nagaradh: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common retina related conditions seen today are related to diabetes and are known as diabetic retinopathy. Yes the cases are increasing to a greater extent with a sedentary lifestyle which most of the middle-aged people are used to it nowadays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Kalpana R: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common retinal conditions we see today are diabetic retinopathy, age related macular degenerations and Glaucoma and eye stroke. Lifestyle changes like prolonged screen time renders a person obese, enhancing diabetes. Diabetes mellitus could occur familial or secondary due to co-morbidities, bad dietary habits and sedentary lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How can people differentiate between normal age-related vision changes and potential warning signs of retinal diseases?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Yogesh Patil: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prolonged near work and less outdoor time is leading to higher incidence of minus Glasses called “myopia epidemic.” In children, sustained near focus may accelerate myopia progression leading to gradual increase in glass power. Higher minus power (Myopia) increases risk of several problems like retinal tears &amp;amp; detachments and Myopic macular degeneration. Chronic stress and irregular sleep are risk factors for development of central serous chorioretinopathy, a retinal condition more seen in young and middle aged males. Sedentary lifestyle, obesity and low physical activity can lead to early development of diabetic, hypertension and raised cholesterol levels which secondarily leads Diabetic Retinopathy, Retinal vein occlusion like diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Krishna Nagaradh: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vision changes due to retinal conditions are usually sudden in onset and are more obvious like appearance of floaters in front of eyes, seeing flashes or beginning to see distorted images, at the same time vision changes related to normal ageing are usually gradual like difficulty in focusing near objects over a period of time like seen in presbyopia or gradual blurring of vision with glare like symptoms seen in cataract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Kalpana R: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normal age-related visual changes could be due to receding of reading distance (usually starts in late 30’s or early 40’s) called as presbyopia. Dry eyes causing blurred vision, cataracts causing blurred vision or effective vision. Eye fatigue is common after straining. People cannot differentiate between the normal aging of the eyes and vision disturbances due to retinal diseases unless they become severe and cause a significant amount of vision loss. Hence, regular eye check-ups are mandatory to identify and treat them at the earliest. Retinal diseases symptoms are such as seeing floaters, flashes, loss of vision, loss of central vision, and loss of peripheral vision. Individuals should be mindful that before these symptoms occur a significant amount of retina is affected beyond repair in certain conditions like diabetes, degenerative diseases, glaucoma., etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;We hear a lot about diabetic retinopathy—how big of a public health concern is it right now?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Yogesh Patil:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Currently India has the second-largest diabetic population in the world and Diabetic Retinopathy is the most common cause of vision loss in working-age adults worldwide. Approximately in India there are 12 million people suffering from Diabetic Retinopathy and 20% of these have variable degree of permanent vision loss. The worst part of Diabetic Retinopathy is no pain, very few subtle symptoms in early stages and by the time patients present with complaints its already advanced stage with some amount of permanent vision loss. Advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy require expensive treatments like lasers, intravitreal injections, surgery). The good news is up to 90% of vision loss from DR can be prevented with timely screening, sugar control and early treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Krishna Nagaradh: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in the middle aged population. Globally there were 12 crore people suffering from diabetic retinopathy in 2010 and this number can reach upto 20 crores by 2030. Diabetic retinopathy has the potential to cause blindness and with increasing prevalence of diabetes worldwide makes this condition a bigger public health condition which has to to be taken seriously and people should get screened so that the patients are diagnosed early and treated to prevent major vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Kalpana R: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetic retinopathy is of major concern in today’s world since the number of cases are increasing despite awareness. It’s a condition which affects the retinal blood vessels and in turn affects the layers of the retina at different stages causing blindness if not treated at the earliest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What role does early detection play in preventing severe vision loss from conditions like macular degeneration or retinal detachment?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Yogesh Patil: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macular degeneration and retinal detachment are two separate diseases but if detected early treatment is simpler and more vision rewarding in both. In case of retinal detachment early detection involves screening for flashes and floaters, detecting peripheral Retinal degeneration/tears which can easily be treated with a quick outpatient laser via major surgery for retinal detachment. Early detection of dry macular degeneration means patients can start lifestyle changes (diet rich in antioxidants, stopping smoking, supplements in select cases) and monitoring which can slow progression of condition to more devastating disease like Wet Macular degeneration. Even in wet age related macular degeneration: If detected early, intravitreal anti-VEGF injections can preserve reading and driving vision whereas detected late (scarred macula), even the best treatment cannot restore useful central vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Krishna Nagaradh: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early detection is crucial in treating any of the retinal conditions as we can minimise the damage caused to the retina and slow the disease progression which in turn preserves the vision. In treating retinal detachment intervention done in hours to days of time will restore maximum vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Kalpana R: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ingemination to prevent peripheral vision loss due to retinal diseases is a regular eye check up with an ophthalmologist (not optical) and following the investigations and treatment protocols suggested by the doctor without fail. The amount of retinal cells lost in the inadvertence cannot be reverted. All the attempts are to retain the viable tissue for a prolonged period to give some amount of quality of life to the patient. Retinal detachment is realized early by the patient (which is possible by noticing loss of vision suddenly or gradually, floaters and flashes) can be treated well and there is a possibility of patients getting a good quality of vision post-surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How important is diet and lifestyle in protecting retinal health, and what simple habits can people adopt?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Yogesh Patil: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have already discussed the role of bad lifestyle/ diet results in several retina diseases. Now let's see what rectification should be done. In terms of diets, foods rich in antioxidants (green leafy vegetables, coloured fruits) and Omega 3 fatty acids( nuts, chia seeds, fish) should be a regular part of one’s diet. Restrict refined sugars, processed food, alcohol and tobacco / smoking, regular exercise improves blood flow, lowers risk of diabetes &amp;amp; hypertension. Annual/ regular eye check-ups especially in diabetic, hypertensive or highly myopic. Balanced screen use and encourages outdoor activity in children to reduce myopia progression. Stress &amp;amp; sleep management - lowers risk of CSCR and helps overall vascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="93"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Krishna Nagaradh: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diets rich in anti oxidants like vitamin A,C,E zinc, lutein and zeaxanthin play a vital role in protecting the retina. They are found in abundance in green leafy vegetables. Also foods like fruits and vegetables support the overall functioning of the eyes. To quit smoking is another major lifestyle modification needed to be adopted as it will reduce the oxidative stress over the retina and prevent its damage. Managing blood sugar and blood pressure levels. Protection of once eyes from harmful UV radiations by using protective glasses, keeping self hydrated, reducing screen time, getting enough sleep and avoiding frequent touching of eyes also plays role in maintaining eye health. Regular eye checkups which should include dilated eye examination for early detection of retinal pathology will avoid severe vision damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="101"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Kalpana R: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A well-balanced diet is the most important requirement for healthy eyes. Fruits, nuts, green vegetables are all essential for the function of the retina which carries the electrical impulses to the brain which is converted as an image for us to see. Without balanced nutrition the retina degenerates faster. A proper lifestyle is the quintessence of healthy eyes. Cutting down on screen time, having adequate amount of sleep, using the gadgets at a proper distance (60-70cm away) with anti-reflective screen, avoiding reading in dim lights or glaring lights, following the 20/20/20 rule which is only 20 minutes of attention to gadgets at a stretch, blinking every 20 seconds, and looking at objects 20 meters away; this is of utmost importance to prevent dry eyes and eye strain while working. Well balanced nutrition is mandatory, avoiding eye injuries (wearing protective goggles at necessary times) should be borne in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="108"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What’s one myth about retinal health you wish more people understood correctly?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="110"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Yogesh Patil: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People think that if their vision is good, their retina must be healthy. The truth is early retinal diseases are usually silent. Good vision does not equal a healthy retina. The only way to know is through a regular dilated retinal exam or imaging specially in at risk people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="114"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Krishna Nagaradh: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The major myth which I have heard from many of my patients is that eye check ups need to be done only when they face a difficulty in vision. Regular eye checkups are must especially in diabetics cause early diagnosis and treatment can avoid major eye related complications in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="117"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Kalpana R: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common myth about absent retinal diseases is that they can be cured at any time. But the fact is in some individuals the worst outcome can be averted while in some it can be prolonged. Take good care of your eyes and see the colors of the world with a Duchenne smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="122"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This day is a reminder to check in on your eye health, because conditions like macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal detachment can sneak up without obvious symptoms at first. Regular eye exams are key. A quick visit can help catch problems early and protect your sight long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="124"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just about doctor visits, your lifestyle plays a role too. Eating foods rich in antioxidants (think leafy greens, berries, and fish packed with omega-3s), wearing sunglasses to block UV rays, and keeping your blood sugar and blood pressure in check all support retinal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="126"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, on World Retina Day, give your eyes some love. Schedule that eye exam, grab a pair of good shades, and maybe even swap the fries for a salad, it’s a small step with a big payoff for your vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="128"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 23:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>胶原蛋白补充剂是否有助于减少皮肤衰老的迹象？ - BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr5zj12ye1o</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 jRDKjj"&gt;Collagen: Do you drink it?

The 33-year-old began using it after a "traumatic year" in 2024. Her son was born prematurely, and as a result of stress, the mother-of-three says her skin took a "huge hit".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;She uses marine collagen, the type derived from fish, in a tropical-flavoured gel she drinks every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"My skin definitely seems to be brighter and clearer, plus my hair has never looked better since I started taking it," Kimberlie says. "As a sleep deprived mother, it's definitely made a difference."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Emma Wedgeworth, a consultant dermatologist based on London's Harley Street, says while there is some &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.6b05679" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;research to suggest taking collagen orally has an impact&lt;/a&gt;, she remains sceptical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;She says the idea that collagen can make its journey through our body - not the easiest of quests - and land exactly where we need it to be is probably wishful thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;For a start, it has to get through the gut without being completely broken down. Collagen is a large molecule so companies have now started to break it up into smaller pieces - collagen peptides - otherwise known as hydrolysed collagen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Even though this collagen - now in its smaller form - has a better chance of making its way through the intestinal wall and into the bloodstream, it still has a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;It has to reach the skin to have an impact, and it could just as easily slip off to support other organs in the body. It's a valuable resource.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"There is little reliable evidence on this, but there is a theory that because our skin is the organ with the 'fastest turnover' of cells, it might be more likely to use these collagen peptides above other organs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;And that's when you might get an increase in collagen being made in the skin cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;'You can't risk stopping'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;That all seems very complicated - and uncertain. It may leave you asking: what about using collagen creams? They're going directly onto the skin, so won't they stand more chance of getting where they need to be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"No," is Ms Wedgworth's simple answer. "The collagen will just sit on the outer layer of your skin, it won't reach the dermis - which is the middle layer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;There are three different types of collagen supplements: marine (from fish), bovine (from cows), and vegan. Of the three, the dermatologist recommends marine if you are taking collagen orally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;This is because it contains more type 1 collagen - the most common of the five types and the one that gives structure to our skin cells, as well as playing a crucial role in the health of our bones, tendons and connective tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Vegan collagen is the least effective, says Ms Wedgeworth. Collagen is an animal-derived protein, so these products are not actually made of collagen, and instead contain a range of amino acids and vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/835f/live/0e8c2f80-9ae2-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/835f/live/0e8c2f80-9ae2-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/835f/live/0e8c2f80-9ae2-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/835f/live/0e8c2f80-9ae2-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/835f/live/0e8c2f80-9ae2-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/835f/live/0e8c2f80-9ae2-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/835f/live/0e8c2f80-9ae2-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/835f/live/0e8c2f80-9ae2-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Matthew Montgomery Ali Watson at the gym, smiling at the camera and rubbing chalk on her hands

"That's the thing with these supplements," the 46-year-old says, "life does have its ups and downs. You might take them when you're on a down, then things pick up again - and it might have very little to do with the supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"But by that stage, you can't risk stopping."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Professor Faisal Ali, a consultant dermatologist at Mid Cheshire NHS Trust, says one of the issues consumers and clinicians face is the amount of conflicting information and conflicting interests in supplement research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;A recent, relatively small, study compared &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002934325002839" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;research funded by the wellness industry&lt;/a&gt; to studies that did not have the same conflict of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;While industry-funded studies suggested collagen supplements significantly improved skin hydration, elasticity and wrinkles, those that did not receive funding from pharmaceutical companies revealed no effect on skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Prof Ali says industry-funded studies are not "inherently bad", it's just such a varied picture. But he says there is a lack of robust evidence to suggest oral and topical collagen have any substantial effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;So if I could turn back time and start drinking and banking collagen in my 20s, would I have smoother, more youthful skin now, I ask him? Probably not, he says. It doesn't stay in the body for that long - we haven't got a collagen store cupboard that we can just dip into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3bb2/live/5661bb50-9ae1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3bb2/live/5661bb50-9ae1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3bb2/live/5661bb50-9ae1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3bb2/live/5661bb50-9ae1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3bb2/live/5661bb50-9ae1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3bb2/live/5661bb50-9ae1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3bb2/live/5661bb50-9ae1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3bb2/live/5661bb50-9ae1-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Micro derma facial roller" class="sc-5340b511-0 bGQwLJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 lha-dta"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Microneedling makes small wounds in the skin which may trigger collagen production&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;However, Prof Ali believes we can potentially boost collagen output and maintain elasticity in our skin by using special techniques&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11499218/#fn-group1" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt; such as laser collagen stimulation and microneedling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;This means using a number of tiny, specialist needles or a laser to make small wounds to our skin, which then encourage a repair process, triggering new collagen formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But that's not cheap. You could be paying up to £300 for one session. Is there a less costly alternative?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"The best thing you can do for your skin," Prof Ali says, "is using decent sunblock. We know the sun has a huge impact on ageing our skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Sun cream, healthy diet, and if you smoke, stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"These will have a far greater impact than collagen supplements."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 22:37:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5YYXJORjRDaWc5bXpCYnhia0s5YjVJTUNEMGxtUklhSy11ZnpTcHpsbW40UDZPOHZmYzdFMnd0Qkc3Y2hkaTJGUldGcDJIaWNXS0pmbXY2UUQzZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE9VUnkwTWhPQ0lSNDNRQTYySnIzc2VtSVpjLXdwcXNpUGJBM3g3SU0xdWp3bDJ0dl9DSENNTWk5NDU5UjBtbnlVTnZHbzY4ZUZlWDA5NTlMMXdFSUhfNVNZ</guid></item><item><title>首席拉比敦促在耶路撒冷麻疹死亡后接种疫苗-以色列国家新闻</title><link>https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/415474</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content-inside article-content" id="articleContent" data-v-2a4c3726 data-v-e580db1b-s&gt;&lt;p id="intext-1" class="sideInf" data-v-2a4c3726 data-v-e580db1b-s data-v-4bdf62d7&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-v-2a4c3726 data-v-e580db1b-s&gt;Israel’s Chief Rabbis on Thursday issued an urgent call to the public to vaccinate their children against measles virus, following the spread of the disease and the recent deaths that it has caused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-v-2a4c3726 data-v-e580db1b-s&gt;In their official letter, the Chief Rabbis emphasized that “Torah commands us to do everything possible to protect ourselves and our health,” citing the verse, “You shall greatly safeguard your lives,” as a halakhic (pertaining to Jewish law) obligation to vaccinate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-v-2a4c3726 data-v-e580db1b-s&gt;“The responsibility for caring for our body and soul rests upon the individual,” the rabbis wrote. “This applies both to treatment when necessary and during illness, and to preventive care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="" album="true" data-v-2a4c3726 data-v-e580db1b-s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="intext-2" class="sideInf" data-v-2a4c3726 data-v-e580db1b-s data-v-4bdf62d7&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="" album="true" data-v-2a4c3726 data-v-e580db1b-s&gt;The appeal comes amid the spread of measles cases in haredi communities in and around Jerusalem.

First and foremost, for anyone who's 6 months old and above, there are zero safety concerns about the COVID vaccine. We are recommending that everyone 6 months and above get an updated COVID shot this fall to protect them as much as possible for the upcoming respiratory viral season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="47rba"&gt;There are a few groups that we are really strongly encouraging to get vaccinated: People who are above the age of 65 and anyone who is pregnant or considering being pregnant. And we're also encouraging our babies, the age group of 6 months to 24 months. Those groups in particular will benefit tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="1ik7l"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Centers for Disease Control’s Vaccine Advisory Board is recommending that people consult with their doctor before getting a coronavirus shot. That is a shift from previous federal policy that made vaccines widely available to almost all Americans older than 6 months for free and without question. What does it mean to consult with a clinician?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="1tge1"&gt;Unless you have a special or unique medical situation that requires you to have further consultation with your physician, there is no need for consultation. For the COVID vaccine, specifically, I want to underline again that there has been no new data presented about any safety concerns about the COVID vaccine. Again, my recommendation and the city's recommendation, in partnership with New York State health commissioner, is that those 6 months and over should go ahead and get that vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="5c4d4"&gt;I do worry that the very confusing messaging that is coming from our vaccination advisory council at the CDC, as well as the current U.S. health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., are going to make people confused and concerned. We are in a position to say very, very clearly that it is recommended that New Yorkers 6 months old and above get the updated COVID vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="cheq4"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How can New Yorkers get the vaccine at a pharmacy? Do they need to get a prescription for it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="3p0i6"&gt;Luckily, because of action by Gov. Kathy Hochul and the executive order that she signed a couple of weeks ago, New Yorkers do not need a prescription. In fact, the New York City Health Department just relaunched our New York City health map — &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/index.page" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;nyc.gov/health&lt;/a&gt; — with updated information about where you can get the COVID vaccine. It lists not only geographically lists any specific community you're in, it also lists by insurance. We also list a number of places where you can go if you do not have insurance or you can't afford to pay for a vaccine, a COVID vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="5rh49"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now, this summer it seemed like a lot of people were getting sick with COVID, and according to the City Health Department COVID data, there was a steady increase of known COVID cases in August. So, if someone recently had COVID, do they still need to get a vaccine?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="96eev"&gt;In recent weeks we did see a slight uptick in both emergency room visits and hospitalizations for COVID, and we still see that uptick actually for people who are very young and for people over the age of 65. So, COVID is definitely out there and circulating. The evidence suggests that if you just had COVID, it is generally recommended that you wait around three months, at least, after your episode of COVID to get the vaccine. But really you are eligible to get the vaccine really anytime after you're no longer feeling ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dcri7"&gt;And if you have more questions about that, you can certainly also talk to your primary care doctor about what the ideal timing is for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="7brpi"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What about insurance? Does that cover the vaccine?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6u6i9"&gt;We are also very excited to be able to say that all of the insurers across New York City and New York State have agreed to make sure that the COVID vaccine is covered by health insurance. That is incredibly important because no one should have to pay for vaccines. Vaccines are safe and effective. They benefit you and your community and your family. And in many cases they are lifesaving, as we learned very clearly during the height of the emergency phase of the COVID pandemic. Unfortunately last flu season was also one of our worst flu seasons in recent history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dgfo3"&gt;RSV is also circulating. So we want there to be as few barriers as possible to people getting their respiratory viral vaccines. We do have those guarantees from insurers that those vaccines will be covered. It is right about the perfect time for everyone listening to go ahead and get out there and get your COVID flu and RSV vaccine if you're eligible for RSV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="6h0s7"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What if somebody doesn't have insurance? What recourse do they have?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dt98g"&gt;At the City Health Department, part of what we do is, we ensure that no matter if you can pay, no matter where you live, no matter your documentation status, no matter any of those things, we want to make sure that you have access to lifesaving vaccines and healthcare. The NYC Health map lists several places here you can get these vaccines for respiratory viral season, even if you do not health insurance and are unable to pay out of pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="arj7s"&gt;&lt;b&gt;We've talked about the guidance from the federal government and how some people might be confused about new recommendations as it relates to vaccines. As a local city health official, how do you take what's being said from the federal government and then shape vaccine policy here in New York City?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="b6aii"&gt;This is one of our greatest challenges right now. Under normal circumstances, the federal government and the CDC are our partners in really making sure that accurate information is out there in the public. That is not the case right now, and that is incredibly challenging for us. So part of what we do and, and what we will continue to do, no matter what happens at the federal level, is push out information through our social media channels, through talking on the radio with folks like you, Sean, through videos and, and all kinds of different communication approaches to make sure that the message is clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="234oc"&gt;Again, respiratory viral season is here. It’s time to get your COVID flu and RSV vaccine if you're eligible. They are safe and effective. That has not changed. And we will do our very best to make sure that those vaccines are free and accessible for everyone who's ready to get them, especially for the groups that are at highest risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="eofnh"&gt;&lt;b&gt;That's New York City Health Commissioner, Dr. Michelle Morse. Commissioner, as always, thanks for joining us.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dtqe5"&gt;Thanks for having me, Sean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 20:22:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxPY3JtMThCM0JNY2M1TVZWS3V0aVdYLTZrZFMwRnJIZ3Q1c2JvbUhpcmtodE1nT1BQOEVQNFpGejNQWlRwWlRHWHVYRDZfUG1qZGZXT1BleXl3RUFBSzFWc0s2aXFuMU9kNzloeTNSYXNsUldyM0h1NUpIVGt0b2FkcHJMNi1ZSFk</guid></item><item><title>噩梦细菌，超级细菌在加利福尼亚州崛起-补丁</title><link>https://patch.com/california/across-ca/nightmare-bacteria-superbugs-rise-california</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="styles_Section__card__4Uoov"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infection rates from drug-resistant “nightmare bacteria” have spiked across the United States and in California at the same time a fungal superbug is spreading in the Golden State, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-02404" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists and state health officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case of “nightmare bacteria” rose almost 70% in five years the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.

Just a few years prior, the bacteria was considered rare in the state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Double Whammy&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The alarming rise in anti-biotic resistant bacteria is happening at the same time the state is battling the spread of another drug-resistent superbug.

The year before, the state record 632 cases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bacteria can also cause infections in patients with existing serious medical problems, or who are undergoing operations or other invasive procedures, according to UCLA hospital officials. In 2015, more than 100 patients at UCLA Medical Center were exposed to the superbug, which may have been responsible for two deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria that are difficult to treat due to the so-called NDM gene primarily drove the increase, CDC researchers said. Only two antibiotics work against those infections, and the drugs are expensive and must be administered through an IV, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bacteria with the gene were once considered exotic, linked to a small number of patients who received medical care overseas. Though the numbers are still small, the rate of U.S. cases jumped more than fivefold in recent years, the researchers reported.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The rise of NDMs in the U.S. is a grave danger and very worrisome,” said David Weiss, an Emory University infectious diseases researcher, in an email.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's likely many people are unrecognized carriers of the drug-resistant bacteria, which could lead to community spread, the CDC scientists said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That may play out in doctors’ offices across the country, as infections long considered routine — like urinary tract infections — could become harder to treat, said Dr. Maroya Walters, one of the report’s authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial resistance occurs when germs such as bacteria and fungi gain the power to fight off the drugs designed to kill them. The misuse of antibiotics was a big reason for the rise — unfinished or unnecessary prescriptions that didn’t kill the germs made them stronger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In recent years, the CDC has drawn attention to “ nightmare bacteria ” resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. That includes carbapenems, a class of antibiotics considered a last resort for treatment of serious infections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They counted 4,341 cases of carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections from those states in 2023, with 1,831 of them the NDM variety. The researchers did not say how many of the infected people died.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rate of carbapenem-resistant infections rose from just under 2 per 100,000 people in 2019 to more than 3 per 100,000 in 2023 — an increase of 69%. But the rate of NDM cases rose from around 0.25 to about 1.35 — an increase of 460%, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A researcher not involved in the study said the increase is probably related to the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that there was a huge surge in antibiotic use during the pandemic, so this likely is reflected in increasing drug resistance,” said Dr. Jason Burnham, a Washington University researcher, in an email.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CDC’s count is only a partial picture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many states are not fully testing and reporting cases. Even in states that do, cases tend to be among hospital patients sick enough to warrant special testing. Many hospitals also aren’t able to do the testing needed to detect certain forms of genetic resistance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CDC researchers did not have data from some of the most populous states, including California, Florida, New York and Texas, which means the absolute number of U.S. infections “is definitely underestimated,” Burnham said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is not the first study to report a rise. A CDC report published in June noted an increase in NDM cases in New York City between 2019 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;— &lt;em&gt;The Asssociated Press contributed to this report. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k SubscribeCTABlurb_SubscribeCTABlurb__M_Azu"&gt;Get more local news delivered straight to your inbox. &lt;a target="_blank" href="/subscribe" class=""&gt;Sign up for free Patch newsletters and alerts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiBox-root css-0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 19:20:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxObnR5LUI3Tm9mOFRqSzJTVmVSeHJMdmZ0WEp2d0tLcFI4cmZxVThzVGRiN1hFc3RnTTMxNW5rSVhPM1hVaXJGWXk3SlN0Q2FTUmktWHMxN3RhQzF1RzVnQ3BqQUZpN0ZNSjZCaTFXUXoyaEpXLURhbEtuTThMZW9Tek44YWZtdTZReklR0gGqAUFVX3lxTFBrTEJLVlMxT3Q4VmIteEt5bnV6b2tDbmtRdFctUHJrdTNHNWlTTUhTdHRLVTFVMnJXTnNCZHZnZGpveGc5d2xOcDdyLVNxWWp4Y2UxMmdvTGZEYkY0ZkVZdkI5OFF5cTNaV3FMWTc5b3J5ZU5YdEhza3JWQk55bXhvbVdFajJzWFdTRWdEQjdYNmx3N1NabGtfb2M5dXdmbENLSTZWaWRyN3dR</guid></item><item><title>睡眠障碍预测未来几年的帕金森氏症或痴呆症-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/sleep-disorders-parkinsons-dementia-29744/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Two landmark international studies show that brain biomarkers can predict whether people with REM sleep behaviour disorder (iRBD) will develop Parkinson’s disease or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). MRI scans revealed that reduced glymphatic system function signals higher risk for Parkinson’s, while increased free water in the basal nucleus of Meynert predicts progression to DLB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings come from the largest imaging studies ever conducted in patients with confirmed iRBD. The results pave the way for earlier diagnosis, targeted monitoring, and preventive treatments before irreversible brain damage occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parkinson’s Predictor:&lt;/strong&gt; Reduced glymphatic fluid circulation doubled Parkinson’s risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DLB Predictor:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher free water in the basal nucleus of Meynert raised DLB risk 8-fold.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; First tools to differentiate disease outcomes years before symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Montreal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An international research team led by Université de Montréal medical professor Shady Rahayel has made a major breakthrough in predicting neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to two complementary UdeM studies, scientists are now able to determine, years in advance, which individuals with a particular sleep disorder will develop Parkinson’s disease or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies focus on isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder (iRBD)—a condition in which people yell, thrash, or act out their dreams, sometimes violently enough to injure a bed partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not just restless sleep—it’s a neurological warning sign,” said Rahayel, a neuropsychologist and researcher at the Centre for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine at Sacré-Cœur Hospital in Montreal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly 90 per cent of people with this sleep disorder will go on to eventually develop Parkinson’s disease or DLB. Until now, however, it was impossible to know which disease would occur—or when.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First biomarker: predicting Parkinson’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first study, led by UdeM doctoral student in neurosciences Violette Ayral and published in &lt;em&gt;Neurology &lt;/em&gt;on September 16, involved 428 participants from five countries: Canada, the United States, France, the United Kingdom and Czechia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It examined the brain’s glymphatic system—a network that clears metabolic waste during sleep, including proteins linked to neurodegeneration. When this system is impaired, waste accumulates, potentially triggering diseases like Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an advanced MRI technique known as DTI-ALPS, researchers measured fluid circulation in specific brain regions in 250 patients with iRBD and 178 healthy control subjects, with an average follow-up of six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key finding: patients with a lower DTI-ALPS index in the left hemisphere of the brain (indicating reduced fluid circulation) were 2.4 times more likely to develop Parkinson’s disease in the years that followed. No such link was found for dementia with Lewy bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This asymmetry mirrors what we see clinically in early Parkinson’s, where motor symptoms often start on one side of the body – it may mark the very earliest stage of the disease,” said Ayral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first evidence that glymphatic function, as measured by MRI, can predict progression to Parkinson’s—and the largest international study ever conducted on this topic among patients with polysomnography-confirmed REM sleep disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second biomarker: predicting DLB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second study, led by UdeM doctoral student in neuropsychology Celine Haddad and published in &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt; on September 19, focused on 438 participants from the same five countries as the first study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took a different approach to predict the onset of DLB —a condition combining Parkinsonian symptoms (tremors, rigidity) and Alzheimer-like symptoms (cognitive impairment, confusion, hallucinations). It’s the second most common degenerative dementia after Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers measured the amount of “free water” — water not bound by brain cells and able to flow freely between them — in the basal nucleus of Meynert, a key region for thought and reasoning. This free water is a sign of early microscopic changes, such as inflammation or cell loss, and serves as an indirect marker of neuronal degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a median follow-up of 8.4 years, the results were striking: individuals who developed DLB had significantly higher levels of free water in this brain region, making them eight times more likely to convert to this form of dementia. This method proved more sensitive than traditional approaches based on brain atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s fascinating is that this marker picks up very early changes—even before symptoms emerge,” said Haddad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toward precision medicine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies represent the largest international imaging research ever done on patients with polysomnography-confirmed iRBD, and pave the way for personalized screening tests to predict which disease will develop before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians will be able to tailor medical monitoring to each patient’s trajectory and better target clinical trials for preventive treatments, the researchers say, adding that their early intervention model could transform care for neurodegenerative diseases by addressing them before irreversible damage occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We already knew that isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder is a warning sign for these diseases,” said Rahayel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we didn’t know was who would develop what. Thanks to these complementary studies, we now have tools to better predict and personalize care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and Parkinson’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#412b6f222e33252420346c26203b20282d2d2401342c2e2f353324202d6f2220" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Julie Gazaille&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://umontreal.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Montreal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Julie Gazaille – University of Montreal&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DTI-ALPS associates with differential phenoconversion in patients with isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder: a multicenter MRI study&lt;/a&gt;” by Shady Rahayel et al. &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DTI-ALPS associates with differential phenoconversion in patients with isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder: a multicenter MRI study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background and Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is the strongest prodromal marker of synucleinopathies, including Parkinson disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Identifying brain biomarkers that predict progression and distinguish phenoconversion trajectories remains a challenge. The glymphatic system is involved in interstitial waste clearance, and its dysfunction has been associated with pathologic protein accumulation and neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diffusion tensor imaging along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) has been proposed as a noninvasive proxy for glymphatic function. The aim of this study was to determine whether patients with iRBD show a reduced DTI-ALPS index compared with controls and whether a lower DTI-ALPS index predicts future phenoconversion to PD or DLB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted a longitudinal, multicenter cohort study using brain MRI scans from patients with polysomnography-confirmed iRBD and healthy controls recruited across 5 international centers. All participants underwent T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI. DTI-ALPS indices were computed from diffusivity along projection and associative fibers adjacent to the lateral ventricles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary outcome was time to phenoconversion to synucleinopathy. Linear models assessed baseline group differences and clinical correlates, and Cox proportional hazard models assessed the predictive value of DTI-ALPS for time to phenoconversion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 250 patients with iRBD (mean age: 66.5 ± 6.8 years; 87% male) and 178 controls (65.7 ± 6.8 years; 81% male) were included. Patients with iRBD showed a lower left DTI-ALPS index compared with controls (mean difference = −0.034, 95% CI −0.067 to −0.001; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.043). Of 224 patients with iRBD followed for a mean of 6.1 ± 3.5 years, 65 phenoconverted to a synucleinopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Converters had a lower left DTI-ALPS index than nonconverters (mean difference = −0.050, 95% CI −0.098 to −0.003; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.038). Lower left DTI-ALPS index was associated with an increased risk of conversion to PD over time (hazard ratio = 2.43, 95% CI 1.13–5.25; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.012). Other diffusion metrics inside periventricular masks, namely fractional anisotropy, diffusivity metrics, and free water, did not differ between groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with iRBD exhibit a reduced DTI-ALPS index, suggesting altered glymphatic function. This reduction was associated with future phenoconversion to PD, supporting the DTI-ALPS index as a potential prognostic MRI biomarker of progression in prodromal synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 19:08:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE94VlFfUzBpU0tLdm5sSXB1dkxWalNuQmRDbUVCU0ZLbzc0eTFFNDBUbkZrT1dUazN0Z2V6MmRfa09fYkJMREM2U3RHZmxtajVFRlRDVjFpeWtiSkdRVktRcmxsZTNuN3VOMWUwNTB1MmFuRjdlUmdDbHVVQQ</guid></item><item><title>慢性失眠可能引发引发痴呆症的大脑变化- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/chronic-insomnia-may-spark-changes-in-the-brain-that-trigger-dementia</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Staring at the ceiling while the clock blinks 3am doesn't only sap energy for the next day. A large, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12425456/"&gt;long-running US study&lt;/a&gt; of older adults has now linked chronic insomnia to changes inside the brain that set the stage for &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/dementia-283"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers, from the Mayo Clinic in the US, followed 2,750 people aged 50 and over for an average of five and a half years. Every year the volunteers completed detailed memory tests and many also had brain scans that measured two telltale markers of future cognitive trouble: the buildup of amyloid plaques, and tiny spots of damage in the brain's white matter – known as white-matter hyperintensities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were classed as having chronic insomnia if their medical records contained at least two insomnia diagnoses a month apart – a definition that captured 16 percent of the sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-a-trait-in-speech-that-foreshadows-cognitive-decline"&gt;Scientists Identify a Trait in Speech That Foreshadows Cognitive Decline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with people who slept soundly, those with chronic insomnia experienced a faster slide in memory and thinking and were 40 percent more likely to develop mild cognitive impairment or dementia over the study period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the team looked more closely, they saw that insomnia paired with shorter-than-usual sleep was especially harmful. These poor sleepers already performed as if they were four years older at the first assessment and showed higher levels of both amyloid plaques and white-matter damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, insomniacs who said they were sleeping more than usual, perhaps because their sleep problems had eased, had less white-matter damage than average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do both amyloid plaques and blood-vessel damage matter?  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="175187" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease isn't driven by &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d42473-024-00275-0"&gt;amyloid alone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7477392/"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; increasingly show that clogged or leaky small blood vessels also speed cognitive decline, and the two disease states can &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/13/2/218"&gt;magnify each other&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White-matter hyperintensities disrupt the wiring that carries messages between &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39611374/"&gt;brain regions&lt;/a&gt;, while amyloid gums up the neurons &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4135182/"&gt;themselves&lt;/a&gt;. Finding higher levels of both in people with chronic insomnia strengthens the idea that poor sleep may push the brain towards a double hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's models confirmed the well-known effect of carrying the ApoE4 variant; the strongest common genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's. Carriers declined more quickly than non-carriers, and the insomnia effect was large enough to be comparable to the effect of having the gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists suspect ApoE4 amplifies the damage of sleepless nights by &lt;a href="https://molecularneurodegeneration.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13024-016-0138-8"&gt;slowing the overnight clearance of amyloid&lt;/a&gt; and making blood vessels &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2247-3"&gt;more vulnerable to inflammation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these findings add to a growing body of research, from &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22354-2"&gt;middle-aged civil servants in the UK&lt;/a&gt;, to community studies in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aging-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2022.1037650/full"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28228567/"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;, showing that how well we sleep in midlife and beyond tracks closely with how well we think later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic insomnia appears to accelerate the trajectory towards dementia, not through one pathway but several: by boosting amyloid, eroding white matter and probably raising blood pressure and blood-sugar levels too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That sounds like an obvious next step, but the evidence is mixed. The Mayo Clinic researchers found no clear benefit, or harm, from the sleeping pills its participants were taking. Trials of newer drugs such as orexin blockers have hinted at reductions in Alzheimer-related proteins in spinal fluid, but these &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36897120/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; are tiny and short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, delivered in person or digitally, remains the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33164742/"&gt;gold-standard treatment&lt;/a&gt; and improves sleep in around &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9802437"&gt;70% of patients&lt;/a&gt;. Whether it also protects the brain is still unproven, although &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29220627/"&gt;one small trial&lt;/a&gt; in people with mild cognitive impairment showed sharper executive function after this type of talk therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the relationship is unlikely to be as simple as "treat insomnia, avoid dementia". Poor sleep often co-exists with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="175187" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, anxiety, chronic pain and sleep apnea – all of which themselves hurt the brain. Unravelling which piece of the puzzle to target, and when, will take rigorously designed long-term studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prevention starts early&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants in Mayo Clinic study were, on average, 70 years old at the start of the study, but &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22354-2"&gt;other research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that routinely sleeping less than six hours a night in your 50s is already linked to higher dementia risk two decades later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That suggests prevention efforts shouldn't wait until retirement. Keeping an eye on sleep from midlife, alongside blood pressure, cholesterol and exercise, is a sensible brain-health strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleepless nights are more than a nuisance. Chronic insomnia appears to accelerate both amyloid buildup and silent blood-vessel damage, nudging the brain toward cognitive decline – especially in people who already carry the high-risk ApoE4 gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good quality sleep is emerging as one of the modifiable pillars of brain health, but scientists are still working out whether fixing insomnia can truly head off dementia, and at what stage of life interventions will have the greatest payoff.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265216/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

But don’t be fooled, this isn’t just aimless noise. No, this pup is on a mission. And clearly, it has a system that works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within seconds, Mom arrives on cue like a doting room service cart, and it’s game on. The puppy dives in like it’s been wandering the desert, and milk has never existed before this moment. Siblings gather around, but it’s obvious who made the magic happen, this little summoner started the snack stampede.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best part? That tiny, pitiful whine that somehow manages to sound both demanding &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; adorable. It’s not a cry for attention, it’s a call to action. And it’s working. The internet has already dubbed this pup the "Snack Siren,” “Milk Mage,” and our personal favorite: “The Chosen Chugger.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the kind of video that hits all the right notes: fluffy ears, and the sheer power of a puppy who knows how to get results. Whether you're a dog lover, a parent of a similarly dramatic toddler, or just someone who appreciates a well-executed summon, this clip is guaranteed to brighten your scroll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes all it takes is one determined little voice to make the milk (or magic) happen. Whether you're summoning snacks, motivation, or Monday morning coffee, let this golden go-getter be your inspo: whine with purpose and believe the milk wagon will come. 🐾🍼&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S. If we could bottle that puppy power, we’d never wait for snacks again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Every pack has a voice!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it’s the tiniest one that leads the charge.

But that’s a perilous decision that could jeopardize the health of infants, weaken protection against debilitating diseases and lead to outbreaks, medical experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Childhood vaccination rates are backsliding across the country, a trend professionals widely attribute to misinformation about the safety of shots. Those fears have been amplified by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy and President Donald Trump, who this week encouraged parents to break up childhood vaccinations into multiple doctors visits and postpone some altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/#/bundle/postmost?method=SURL&amp;amp;location=YAHOO&amp;amp;initiative=feed" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Trump criticized the current federal recommendation schedule as a “disgrace” that overwhelms young children with shots and leads to lasting harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Overstating the risk of vaccines sows distrust overall,” said Ari Brown, a pediatrician in Austin. “It is very easy to scare people, and very difficult to un-scare them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Scientific data show that getting several vaccines at once is safe, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Combination vaccines have been used in the United States since the mid-1940s. Ignoring the long-standing federally recommended vaccine schedule for infants can have severe and lasting consequences if ignored, according to public health professionals and advocates, who say Trump’s health advice is dangerous and not grounded in science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Here’s what medical specialists say about delaying or postponing childhood vaccines:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What is the recommended immunization schedule?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The childhood immunization schedule is a federal recommendation for all the shots kids need as they grow and develop. It’s a carefully crafted timeline that considers when certain vaccines can best protect a child from debilitating diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Babies and young children are often given several shots at the same time to reduce the amount of visits to the doctor. That process is designed to protect them as quickly as possible, and also save parents time, money and reduce trauma on the child. Some vaccines - like the one for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) - are given as a combination to reduce the number of shots administered during a single visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The CDC currently recommends parents vaccinate their child before the age of 2 against more than a dozen infectious diseases, including measles, chicken pox, hepatitis B, tetanus, whooping cough and polio. A Washington Post-KFF poll conducted this summer found that 1 in 6 parents have delayed or skipped some vaccines for their children, excluding for coronavirus or flu, and about a quarter of parents (26 percent) said the CDC recommends “too many” childhood vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Trump’s remarks - the latest in his administration’s embrace of anti-vaccine rhetoric - come as immunization rates fall across the country and measles cases rise to their highest in over 30 years. Public health experts worry vaccination rates will decline even further under the current administration, as the president and health secretary use their platform to amplify misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In August, the Department of Health and Human Services revived a long-defunct task force that was initially created in 1986 as part of broader legislation to address childhood vaccine safety. According to HHS, the task force will make recommendations focused on developing and refining childhood vaccines that result in “fewer and less serious adverse reactions,” among other things. The task force will send its first report for Congress within two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What happens if I delay shots for myself, or children?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Delaying a shot outside the recommended schedule leaves children vulnerable to diseases when they are most at risk of getting ill, developing serious complications - or dying - if they contract it. That’s because their bodies and organs are still developing, and their immune systems aren’t yet equipped to handle certain infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There is a lot of work that goes into figuring out what the optimal scheduling timing is and when we should vaccinate,” said James Campbell, a pediatric infectious-disease specialist at the University of Maryland Children’s Hospital and School of Medicine. “If you’re making up your own schedule, you don’t have backing from the data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If an infant catches a vaccine-preventable disease like pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, they have a much higher risk of severe acute disease, hospitalization or death, Campbell said. Others, like hepatitis B, leave a higher risk of developing health complications later in life. That means the risk of complications are higher than the risk of serious vaccine side effects, which are extremely rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The vaccine for human papillomavirus is recommended for children at ages 11 or 12, typically before they’re exposed to the virus through sexual activity. It’s also an age when they are most likely to generate the most amount of antibodies. The HPV vaccine has the potential to prevent more than 90 percent of cancers caused by the virus, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Do multiple vaccines at once overwhelm the immune system?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;No. Vaccines don’t overwhelm the immune system, but instead help it recognize and fight specific diseases, according to medical experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Vaccines contain antigens - or tiny parts of viruses or bacteria - that spark an immune response when introduced into the body. The amount of antigens in a vaccine is much lower than what the child would experience if exposed to the disease itself, so the shots do not induce serious illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Brown, the pediatrician in Texas, said that while the majority of parents choose to vaccinate their children, those rates are dropping. According to the CDC, 92.5 percent of kindergartners received their MMR vaccines last school year, with lower rates in some parts of the country. More than 95 percent of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles to achieve herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“That is really scary and troublesome,” said Brown, the pediatrician in Texas. “As vaccination rates go down, you will start to see these diseases return.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related Content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/interactive/2025/toxins-tech-tumors-is-modern-life-fueling-rise-cancer-millennials/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What researchers suspect may be fueling cancer among millennials;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;What researchers suspect may be fueling cancer among millennials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2025/09/25/drew-lynch-comedian-heart-attack-hospital/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Comedian spots man in cardiac arrest during show, finishes set at hospital;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Comedian spots man in cardiac arrest during show, finishes set at hospital &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2025/09/24/jimmy-kimmel-returns-late-night/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jimmy Kimmel advocates for free speech, slams FCC chair in late-night return;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Jimmy Kimmel advocates for free speech, slams FCC chair in late-night return&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 17:42:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxOYWVzMi1GM004czRpUmhTX2dlR0tnLVllMmJBNGY1VGpGU2k2MGVhazloQkdHNXFDeENxQlZOdVc4cGUzajlKQ01KV2o5aGVMOWdvMEE1N0xoZmFrRU9NWkpYcWFfcms1MnhaOElhTGlYTnAwY2t3NmJoRXI4RFZwSndJZzB2Zkg2U0l6b2RFZ041MjQ</guid></item><item><title>在SUNY Oswego附近的废水中检测到麻疹的痕迹，但没有人被诊断出来- WSYR</title><link>https://www.localsyr.com/health/measles-detected-at-low-levels-in-oswego-wastewater-no-clinical-cases/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content article-body rich-text "&gt;
		
		




&lt;p&gt;OSWEGO, N.Y. (WSYR-TV) — The New York State Health Department has detected trace amounts of the measles virus at a wastewater treatment facility in the City of Oswego, the agency said Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Oswego County Health Department informed Oswego Mayor Robert Corradino the infected wastewater is “from the area around the university,” meaning SUNY Oswego. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This could be someone who is prodromal, is passing through, or from the university or someone else who is on the public water system,” the county informed the mayor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="mobile" data-player-id="trfe2dd8" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So far, nobody in Oswego County or the surrounding areas has been detected with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="trfe2dd8" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The state health department has issued an advisory for local hospitals and other medical facilities to be on the lookout for measles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Used routinely after the coronavirus pandemic, testing of wastewater shows if people in the area have shed traces of viruses through their excretory system.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“This detection does not mean there is an outbreak,” State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said. “It is, however, a timely reminder to make sure you and your family are up to date on the MMR vaccine and to keep an eye out for symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Stanford-based company WastewaterSCAN detected the virus. The company and the state-run Wadsworth Center are testing more samples next week. While nobody has been identified so far with the measles virus, the initial positive detection implies that at least one person had measles in Oswego County.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The New York State Department of Health says that in Oswego County, &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/measles/vaccine/docs/Oswego_MMR_vaccination_report.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/measles/vaccine/docs/Oswego_MMR_vaccination_report.pdf"&gt;about 87.8% of children under the age of 2 are vaccinated for measles&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/measles/vaccine/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/measles/vaccine/"&gt;the rest of the state&lt;/a&gt;, that isn’t too bad. But since measles is exceptionally contagious, that still leaves some children and even adults at risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine are 97% effective against measles, the DOH says; one dose is 93% effective.&lt;/p&gt;

When we stay still, gut motility slows down, causing bloating, constipation, and discomfort.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moreover, according to the doctor, prolonged sitting causes a ‘stagnation’ in your gut that heightens inflammation and makes you feel tired at work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He further elaborated, “The gut is not just a tube that moves food from one end to another. It's a complex system with muscles contracting in waves, nerves coordinating these movements, and bacteria aiding digestion. When we sit for too long, these muscles don't get the workout they need. If your overall activity is low, things start to stagnate, especially after a high-calorie, fat-rich, modern diet. This stagnation in the gut can trigger inflammation, slow metabolism, and make you feel lethargic.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What to do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/09/27/original/breaks_1758988285253.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Walk instead of being seated if you are taking calls.

(Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is the best way to protect your gut health if you have a desk job that may include long hours of sitting? Dr Senthil Ganesan highlighted the value of taking frequent breaks, drinking water, and maintaining a high-fibre diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said, “In addition to a daily workout at home, you should avoid sitting in one place at the office for more than 45 minutes. Even short, strategic breaks—like walking around the office or doing stretches—can help. Make a habit of standing up while taking phone calls. Drinking water regularly helps, as dehydration also slows down bowel movements and is a common cause of constipation. Many people turn to high-fibre diets to keep their intestines moving, but fibre alone can't replace movement. ”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His advice was that if you are feeling bloated at work, start moving, such as stretching or standing during calls.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

I’ve met a wonderful woman my age who is smart, funny, attractive, and independent. We get along really well. There’s just one problem: Her body.&lt;/p&gt;

She mainly eats protein bars and works out for several hours a day. Her arms are extremely thin, and her breastbone protrudes. It’s making intimacy difficult. I can’t seem to get past it. What do you suggest?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="122" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg0zn4nr001h3b79mk1ijkwo@published"&gt;First figure out what exactly is making intimacy difficult. Is it sheer aesthetics? Is your fear that this person is living an unhealthy lifestyle distracting you? What is the real issue here? She is a grown woman who is allowed to care for herself and her body however she sees fit. Through observations, you have made certain inferences, but if you haven’t really had conversations with her about her views on what constitutes fitness, you’re just supposing that something is awry. I’m not saying that you’re absolutely wrong, or that your concern has no place, but what could be done practically? Do you think you can enter her life, tell her that she’s doing it all wrong, and that she will submit?&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="161" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg0zn4qp001i3b7944mctxgm@published"&gt;Besides, her arms were extremely thin and her breastbone protruded when you met her. At this early stage in your relationship, is the time for you to determine your attraction level and how viable this connection actually is. Doubts so soon are rarely a good sign. The bare minimum for facilitating a healthy relationship early on is acceptance: You see a person and you think, “This is someone I want in my life.” Seems like you aren’t quite there with this one. If you want to focus on her great personal qualities, maybe you table intimacy for the time being and just get to know her. Maybe at some point, she will convince you that she isn’t leaving a trail of protein bar wrappers to her death. Maybe you’ll only grow more concerned. Whatever attracted her to you in the first place is worth exploring until you find yourself too distracted to do so. Ask yourself whether you’re at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

This prevents the heart from pumping blood and oxygen to the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This led to a 'cannabis-induced cardiac arrest,' the team said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The case comes as a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14761339/heart-attack-risk-linked-cannabis.html"&gt;mountain of recent studies&lt;/a&gt; have suggested cannabis use raises the risk of heart attack, stroke and coronary artery syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An unidentified woman in Georgia suffered a 'cannabis-induced cardiac arrest,' despite having no underlying heart conditions (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And cardiovascular disease, which includes cardiac arrest, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14330127/doctors-warn-silent-disease-kills-cancer-dementia.html"&gt;is America's biggest killer&lt;/a&gt;, taking nearly 1million lives every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings also come amid a 66 percent &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13920613/Alarming-rise-super-fit-slim-young-people-suffering-heart-attacks-experts-reveal-theories-surge.html"&gt;increase in heart attacks among young people&lt;/a&gt; between 2019 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are racing to find the cause of the mysterious heart attacks, but early research suggests obesity, sedentary lifestyle and Covid could be to blame, along with use of drugs like marijuana.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors treating the woman, from WellStar Spalding Health System in Georgia, wrote in a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://amjcaserep.com/abstract/full/idArt/950077"&gt;medical journal&lt;/a&gt;: 'This case highlights a rare but critical presentation of cannabis-induced cardiac arrest in a young, previously healthy woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Unlike most published reports that focus on older adults or those with underlying cardiac abnormalities, our patient had no structural heart disease, genetic predisposition, or metabolic derangement.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear exactly how much cannabis the woman consumed or how often she engaged in the habit, but doctors noted she was a 'chronic' user, which could mean several times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 18million Americans report using marijuana daily or nearly every day. Cannabis use is also on the rise, largely due to recent decriminalization across the US. From 1992 to 2022, daily and near-daily use has seen a 15-fold increase.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The woman's doctors are unsure why exactly cannabis led to a cardiac arrest, but they noted THC can cause an increase in heart rate, which forced the heart's muscles to work harder to pump blood and deliver oxygen to the rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A May 2025 study published in &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14761339/heart-attack-risk-linked-cannabis.html"&gt;JAMA Cardiology&lt;/a&gt; also found that marijuana smokers had a 52 percent reduction in blood vessel function compared to those who never used the drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Endothelial cells, which line the blood vessels and regulate blood flow, released less nitric oxide in people who regularly smoked marijuana or took edibles. Nitric oxide helps blood vessels dilate and deliver vital oxygen throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This impaired function affects the blood vessels' ability to dilate, increasing the risk of atherosclerosis, heart attacks, and strokes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the United States, marijuana is fully legal - for recreational and medicinal use - in 29 states. It is fully illegal in four states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Laws in the remaining states are mixed, meaning the drug may be permitted for medicinal use, allowed only in the form of CBD oil, be decriminalized or be a combination of these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Data shows that heart attack cases are on the rise in young Americans. The new study suggests marijuana could partly be to blame&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The woman's medical team noted that as legalization increases, doctors need to closely evaluate chronic cannabis users for potential heart issues.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They wrote: 'Recreational cannabis use is steadily increasing among both adults and youth due to expanding legalization and easy accessibility, underscoring the urgent need for greater public and clinical awareness of its potential health risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This case highlights the serious cardiovascular consequences of THC.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The woman's heart rhythm returned to normal within a week, and she was discharged from the hospital to a nursing facility with a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The device is a vest that contains a defibrillator, which detects abnormal heart rhythms and sends an electric shock to return them back to normal.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 13:17:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQbVdEbHMxcW9aUHlBUlRjYk5zUXpkbUtwWGh5a25hNGxPZlBseThqQXkwTkViRzJRUy00UEF2UEE2RTVjWmE3UnEzcFlzSGJLb1FQRFJoWEhvRENVQS1Mb0VfemxVQ095SmVaUExPV1BHQXNfMXNZQU9LMW9pLVhDYjY4VDRvTnoxNEFQRXJ1bzFRYmgzWENBYUtPenptd9IBowFBVV95cUxPcTNCWklhdEVSMFp4MUVYNGs5T05UXzhCajhyRzJ0TVp5VENoZXdMaWg1aG1SbTAxNjY4Zm54WkJuTFM4aVdhcW8xaWU0bjhQWmV4eU5HZF9Sa29wWS1EQkc0UHpZZ3lIVkU2MXZPWnM5c09nbHZjU3pZNzYzYnJYUF9mNmR0TVBsbzhfOEVvT0t4bmxZMW8xZVVpU0diUUJpQVRn</guid></item><item><title>我将香烟换成了“更健康”的电子烟，但在电子烟引发罕见肺病后几乎死亡-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15130961/swapped-smoking-vaping-healthier-death-lung-disease.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A smoker who traded cigarettes for vapes to be 'healthier' revealed how she nearly died after the devices triggered a rare lung disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zoe Shackleford, 29, from Strasburg, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/virginia/index.html" id="mol-f9466c70-9a3d-11f0-a8e8-bdbd66cb13cf"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, first started smoking cigarettes at 18, but after four years, she switched to e-cigarettes in the belief they would be a healthier alternative to tobacco. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The devices are often touted as being less toxic than traditional cigarettes and are promoted as a smoking cessation aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For nearly eight years, she used refillable vape devices. But last month, looking for more convenience, she made the switch to disposable vapes - a decision that would nearly end her life.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While refillable vapes and disposable vapes may appear similar, there is a big difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With refillable vapes, e-liquids tend to be more regulated and sold by specialty shops or online, while the disposable equivalents often contain unlisted or unknown chemicals; some use synthetic nicotine or high concentrations of sweeteners, artificial flavors, or heavy metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, the heating elements in refillable vapes are usually made of stainless steel or ceramic coils, while the disposable offerings often use cheaper metals (nickel, chromium, tin, lead), which can leach into the vapor being inhaled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After finishing three disposable vapes (one vape can be equivalent to hundreds of puffs or even multiple packs of cigarettes, depending on the device) Shackleford said she saw her health quickly deteriorate and began experiencing what she initially thought was a mild cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Zoe Shackleford first started smoking cigarettes at 18 but after around four years, switched to e-cigarettes in the belief they would be a 'healthier' alternative&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I thought it was from swimming,' she said. 'I had a sore throat. I didn't think much of it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But within 48 hours, she found herself struggling to breathe, even during basic activities like changing clothes or using the bathroom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shackleford then became completely breathless while speaking, and realized something was seriously wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On August 17, she was rushed to the hospital, where doctors found her airways were functioning at just 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I was first admitted to the hospital, I had only 50 percent of my airway open. It was completely closing off,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[Doctors] said if I hadn't come that night, I probably wouldn't have made it to the hospital.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the hospital, Shackleford was tested for pneumonia, bronchitis, and sepsis - but all results came back negative. Her condition worsened despite initial treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They didn't know how to treat me. Everything they were trying wasn't working, so they kept going with the breathing treatments.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was kept in the hospital for nine days, receiving supplemental oxygen to help her breathe, steroids to open her airways, and antibiotics to combat any possible infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Upon discharge, she was referred to a lung specialist for further evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following a detailed consultation, the specialist diagnosed her with hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) - a rare inflammatory lung condition triggered by an immune response to inhaled substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;On August 17, she went to the hospital where doctors reportedly said her airways were at 50 percent capacity and she could have died if she hadn't sought urgent medical attention &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He said that I have something called hypersensitivity pneumonitis. He said he hasn't seen this in two years,' Shackleford recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The vape that I was using had a chemical that was reacting negatively with my lungs - basically closing off my airway.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HP is caused by inhaling substances like mold, bird droppings, or chemical vapors, and it leads to severe inflammation in the tiny air sacs and airways of the lungs. Without prompt treatment, it can lead to permanent lung scarring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While rare - affecting just one to three people per 100,000 annually - HP is well-documented in people exposed to environmental irritants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is sometimes referred to as 'farmer's lung' because it plagues one percent of farmers, who are repeatedly exposed to mold grown on hay, straw and grain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has also been dubbed 'bird fancier's lung' because it can be caused by breathing in particles from feathers or bird droppings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many other substances can trigger similar disease patterns. In many cases it can be very difficult to find the exact cause. The symptoms include cough, shortness of breath and sometimes fever and joint pains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Shackleford's case, doctors traced the cause back to a chemical used in her disposable vape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now home and recovering, Shackleford is on asthma medication once a day and uses an inhaler twice daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm feeling a lot better, I'm not losing my breath as much,' she said. 'When I first came out of the hospital, even taking a shower exhausted me. I have trouble catching my breath sometimes but it's not as bad.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has since quit vaping and smoking altogether, a decision she admits hasn't been easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's a little bit of a challenge because I do miss it, but I think I miss the motion more,' she said.

You only get one life. Something so simple as stopping vaping can help save it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stopping her vaping habit has also saved Shackleford money, as she would go through a $25 disposable vape every 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Zoe at first dismissed her symptoms as catching a sore throat from swimming late at night - however soon she couldn't speak without losing her breath and rushed to the hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;And study published in June by University of California that tested seven flavored e-cigarettes from three of the most popular brands (ELF Bar, Flum Pebble and Esco) found the disposable vapes release more cancer-causing toxic metals than cigarettes. The above graphic shows the heavy metals in different parts of the tested disposable vapes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vapes and e-cigarettes have long been marketed as a safer alternative to tobacco and a tool for quitting smoking - and in many cases, they may carry fewer immediate toxins than cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But recent studies are raising alarm bells, particularly around disposable vapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2024 University of California study analyzed seven popular flavored disposable vapes - including ELF Bar, Flum Pebble, and Esco - and found they released more toxic heavy metals than cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the vapes tested released more lead in a single day than 20 packs of cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These metals - including lead, nickel, and chromium - come from the heating coils inside the devices, which leach into the liquid and are inhaled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They have been linked to serious health risks including cancer, asthma, and lung scarring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite concerns about the health consequences, vaping continues to grow in popularity, especially among young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2024, 3.5 percent of US middle schoolers and 7.8 percent of high schoolers reported vaping in the past 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That translates to approximately 410,000 middle school and 1.21 million high school students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, adult use of e-cigarettes increased from 4.5 percent in 2019 to 6.5 percent in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shackleford's message to others is simple: don't assume vaping is harmless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was surprised it was the vaping because you hear stories of everybody else — until it actually happens to you,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That was one of the scariest experiences of my life.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Cattlemen's Beef Association funded research finds that Mediterranean-style eating with lean beef produces less trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) compared with a typical American diet that included the same amount of beef.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular risk has been linked to diet quality and to microbiome-derived metabolites such as TMAO. Eating &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/beef/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;beef&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to increase cardiovascular risk due to high saturated fats raising LDL cholesterol, and chemicals produced by &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gut+bacteria/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt; from red meat that increase TMAO levels, promoting arterial plaque buildup, and inflammation. Consuming red and processed meats is linked to a higher risk of heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous clinical trials have hinted that lean, unprocessed &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/red+meat/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;red meat&lt;/a&gt; can fit within heart-healthy patterns without worsening traditional risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Effect of Varying Quantities of Lean Beef as Part of a Mediterranean-Style Dietary Pattern on Gut Microbiota and Plasma, Fecal, and Urinary Metabolites: A Randomized Crossover Controlled Feeding Trial," &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.125.041063" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted a randomized four-round crossover controlled-feeding trial, researchers compared Mediterranean-style diets containing 14, 71, or 156 g/day per 2,000 kcal of lean beef with an average American diet containing 71 g/day per 2,000 kcal, and in a post hoc exploratory analysis evaluated gut microbiota and TMAO-related metabolites.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Each diet period lasted four weeks with at least a one-week washout. Participants included 30 generally &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/healthy+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;healthy adults&lt;/a&gt; from the Penn State site who completed at least two full diet periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood, 24-hour urine, and fecal samples were collected at baseline and end of each period. Plasma, urine, and fecal metabolites were quantified by proton &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/nuclear+magnetic+resonance/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;nuclear magnetic resonance&lt;/a&gt; and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gut microbiota composition was profiled by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Compliance exceeded 90%. Randomization followed an orthogonal Latin-square design with blinding of coordinators, investigators, analysts, and statisticians for outcome assessment and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium was lower in the Mediterranean-style menus, with target values reported as below 2,300 mg per 2,000 kcal versus around 3,500 mg per 2,000 kcal in the average American diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with the average American diet menu, Mediterranean-style menus differed on several reported components. Mediterranean-style was 20–31% higher in total fat, 7–13% higher in protein, 91–110% higher in monounsaturated fat, 13–23% higher in polyunsaturated fat, 15–30% higher in fiber, 8–28% higher in marine n-3, and 20–32% higher in α-linolenic acid. The American diet was higher in carbohydrates by 20–33% and saturated fat by 28–54%.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Compared with the average American diet, Mediterranean-style diets differed in several reported outcomes. The Mediterranean-style was higher in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gut+microbiota/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt; diversity, 1.78–2.04-fold lower in plasma TMAO with 14 g and 71 g of lean beef per 2,000 kcal, 1.76–2.15-fold lower in urinary TMAO across 14 g, 71 g, and 156 g, and higher in plasma l-carnitine with 71 g and 156 g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American diet was higher in fecal choline than the Mediterranean-style diet, with 71 g. TMAO concentrations remained below the reported clinical cut point across all study diets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Findings from the randomized crossover trial show that with beef held constant (71 g per 2,000 kcal), the average American diet produced higher plasma and urinary TMAO than Mediterranean-style eating. Within the Mediterranean-style pattern, raising lean beef from 14 g to 156 g per 2,000 kcal did not raise TMAO. Interpretation restricted to these endpoints points to the overall diet pattern, not beef, as the driver of the observed TMAO differences in this cohort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that this study was funded by the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. While the research was conducted with rigorous controls and blinding, readers should consider the funding source when interpreting the results, as industry funding can introduce potential bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outcomes were short-term TMAO, exploratory and not the prespecified primary endpoints of the parent trial, which was powered for LDL-C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 7.2 million Americans are currently estimated to have Alzheimer’s disease,and experts such as those at the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38689398/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;National Health Institute&lt;/a&gt; say that number could grow to 13.8 million by 2060. As researchers say that indicates clinicians will face “major challenges” in coming years, they are urging people to take a closer look into the lifestyle habits that could help prevent cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“While deaths from cardiovascular disease have declined since 2000, deaths from Alzheimer’s disease have surged by more than 140%,” Dr. Charles H. Hennekens, a professor of Medicine and Preventive Medicine at the Florida Atlantic University Schmidt College of Medicine, told &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250920214459.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Science Daily&lt;/a&gt;. “At the same time, it is estimated that up to 45% of dementia risk could be attributed to modifiable lifestyle and environmental factors.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hennekens is one of the co-authors of a &lt;a href="https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(25)00576-5/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;commentary&lt;/a&gt; in “The American Journal of Medicine” that details some of these, which include: physical inactivity; unhealthy diets; obesity and alcohol consumption. Also included are medical conditions like dyslipidemias, hypertension, diabetes and depression as well as social isolation and intellectual inactivity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, there are “therapeutic lifestyle” changes that could help decrease cognitive decline in elderly patients that have been proven to help those with cardiovascular disease as well as other illnesses, researchers wrote. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These changes include physical activity, adhering to diets like the &lt;a href="https://diet.mayoclinic.org/us/blog/2025/comparing-dash-and-mediterranean-diets-benefits-differences-and-ideal-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mediterranean or DASH diet&lt;/a&gt;, and not smoking. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Therapeutic lifestyle changes, if demonstrated to be beneficial, would have major clinical and public health implications in reducing cognitive decline in the US and worldwide,” researchers said in the commentary. “This possibility is of even greater importance given the interrelationships of cognitive decline with increasing age as well as the increasing proportion of U.S. and other populations of the elderly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers highlighted the results of the Protect Brain Health Through Lifestyle Interventions to Reduce Risk, or &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/us-pointer/home.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;POINTER&lt;/a&gt;, trial, where 2,111 men and women between 60 and 79 years old who were at high risk for cognitive decline because of risk factors were given either a “high intensity lifestyle intervention” or a self-guided program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those in the high intensity lifestyle intervention group had meetings in person, professional guidance and accountability measures, while the ones who were self-guided had educational materials and “general support.” Those in the former group, during the POINTER trial, “demonstrated statistically significant and clinically important improvements in global cognition,” particularly when it came to planning, attention and problem solving. Another trial, Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER,) had similar results. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There are implications for clinical practice, public health, and government policy, as well as further research,” researchers wrote. “Clinicians will now be armed with lifestyle-based changes to reduce cognitive decline. In addition, public health practitioners may also add to their programs based on the study designs of POINTER and FINGER to maintain brain health, complementing pharmacologic approaches.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only can these findings be beneficial from a health perspective — researchers said they also could lead to cost savings. Early attention to risk factors of dementia could reduce people’s medical and caregiving costs, as well as the “expensive costs of the newly developed pharmacologic agents,” some of which offer modest benefits but side effects including “loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue and restlessness,” researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While more research is needed, the current totality of evidence supports a clear path forward: invest in lifestyle-based strategies to protect brain health,” Hennekens said to Science Daily. “Doing so will not only benefit individuals at risk but also serve as a powerful tool for reducing national and global health care burdens related to cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Imani Dell seemed like a happy, healthy 6-year-old. She loved bedtime stories and Chuck E. Cheese. She was energetic and cheerful whether she was at school or home with her parents. In May 2024, she was two weeks away from graduating first grade, and was looking forward to a summer of spending time at the playground in her north Miami neighborhood.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One night, her aunt noticed her eyes were crossed. Imani's mother, Johnesha Brown, thought that it might be because she spent too much time on a tablet. She tried to take Imani to their pediatrician, but found her insurance was expired. When the mother and daughter got home, Imani said she was seeing double. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was scared and so worried, like, now something serious was going on with her," Brown said. She filled out the application to renew her insurance, then called the company. They said it would take 30 days to review the paperwork. "I said 'I can't wait 30 days. My child needs to be seen right now.' And the lady who I spoke to ... She told me to take her to the hospital." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown thought her daughter would just need an eye exam, but when Imani was seen at the University of Miami Health System's emergency room, a nurse said she would need a CT scan to ensure there was nothing wrong in her brain. The test confirmed Brown's worst fears: There was a golf-ball sized tumor in her daughter's brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He came in with his head down, and he said 'Your daughter has a large mass in her head.' Everything just went down from there,'" Brown recalled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"I was just praying the entire time"    &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imani was transferred to the Holtz Children's Hospital, where she underwent brain surgery. Dr. Heather McCrea, the hospital's director of pediatric neurosurgery, said she had three goals with the procedure: to treat fluid build-up in Imani's brain that was caused by the tumor, to remove the mass and to study it to determine what other treatment Imani would need. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operation was successful on all three fronts, McCrea said. Doctors determined the mass was a fast-growing tumor called a medulloblastoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medulloblastomas are tumors that largely occur in children and infants, said Dr. David Harter, the director of the division of pediatric neurosurgery at NYU Langone Health. There are multiple subtypes of this kind of tumor, each with its own "genetic signatures" like "different mutations or developmental pathways," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each subtype has its own symptoms and prognosis, though most forms of medulloblastoma manifest with symptoms like vomiting, headaches or crossed eyes. Medulloblastomas can also commonly cause hydrocephalus, or fluid build-up in the brain. That had caused the fluid McCrea had needed to remove from Imani's brain. The tumor's prognosis also depends on its subtype, Harter said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Imani's tumor was removed, molecular classification was used to determine its subtype. Dr. Bradley Gampel, a pediatric hematologist and oncologist who treated Imani, said her tumor was "Group 4 medulloblastoma with intermediate risk." That meant she would need both chemotherapy and radiation. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classifying tumor subtypes helps doctors ensure patients are receiving proper treatment, Gampel and Harter both said. When treating pediatric patients, it's important to think of how treatment can impact a child's future, Harter said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not just enough to win the war over the tumor," Harter said. "We have to also consider the long-term effects of any therapies that we're going to give." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imani underwent 30 rounds of radiation. The process was hard on her, Brown said: She had to be sedated for the treatment, so she was always sleepy afterward. She had a burn on her head from receiving the therapy. She struggled to eat and lost weight. She had little energy and didn't want to play. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was just praying the entire time, hoping that everything would go well and be okay," Brown said. "And I was thinking about 'How long will my daughter be in treatment? How will she feel when she loses all her hair? She's young, she won't really understand what's going on. How will my daughter feel knowing she's going through all this?'" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the radiation was complete, Imani had a four-week break from treatment. Then, she received nine cycles of chemotherapy over the course of about a year. This process was easier, Brown said, though Imani did lose her hair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this time, Imani was homeschooled, with the mother and daughter spending an hour a day going over a subject like history or math. Imani "didn't like" the homeschooling, Brown said, but it was a relief to see her energy levels begin to return.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Everything just is perfect" &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imani finished treatment during the first week of August 2025, Brown said. To celebrate, the family went to the Epic Universe theme park. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mid-September, Imani returned to school for second grade. While she was nervous about going back to the classroom, Brown said she expected her daughter will like being with her friends and other kids much more than the homeschooling she had last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imani will regularly undergo scans to ensure her cancer isn't returning, McCrea said. Those scans will become more spread out as long as the cancer shows no signs of recurrence. Right now, Imani's scans are "looking good," McCrea said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown said things have been "amazing, amazing, amazing" since Imani finished treatment. Her renewed insurance covered the entire treatment process. Her daughter has been featured in two different research studies. Most importantly, Imani is starting to act like her old self. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My child really finished treatment, and she's going back to being her normal self again," Brown said. "I'm happy. I'm very excited. Everything just is perfect to me."&lt;/p&gt;

That means it’s not only your fatty deposits that’ll take a significant hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, there is a more proven and natural way to cut weight – and that’s to maximise your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p purpleid="02f3949a-cde3-4aec-91ac-699d93ff0fab"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nightmare obesity scenario&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing body of evidence shows insufficient sleep doesn’t simply leave you wrestling with a cranky mood – it contributes to weight gain and heightens the risk of obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a 2022 study by the Mayo Clinic, which revealed subjects who had their sleep restricted in the laboratory endured a 9 per cent increase in abdominal fat and an 11 per cent increase in visceral fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visceral fat is the belly fat buried deep within your abdominal cavity. It protects your organs, but having too much leads to health problems such as diabetes and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A further study into sleep and weight found women who slept for five hours per night were 32 per cent more likely to experience major weight gain (defined as 33lb or more) and 15 per cent more likely to become obese, over the course of the 16-year study, compared to women who slept for seven hours or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why is this, and where do hormones come into it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Optimise sleep, optimise hunger&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/09/CYP_PBP_JB_-21-scaled.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-941100"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The antics of cyclists, such as here at the Paris-Brest-Paris audax, often actively discourage a good night's sleep. &lt;span&gt;Joseph Branston&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a clear relationship between sleep and body mass,” says sleep expert Dr Sarah Gilchrist, whose book &lt;em&gt;The Essential Guide to Women’s Sleep&lt;/em&gt; hits the shelves later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the major reasons why is that we make poor food choices, and a big driver of that is your hormones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Take leptin, which is known as our ‘energy-expenditure hormone’,” Gilchrist adds. “It regulates appetite and is influenced by sleep. Reduced sleep means lower leptin levels and, in turn, greater hunger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then there’s ghrelin. This is called the ‘hunger hormone’ because it increases the drive to eat. Ghrelin levels increase through lack of sleep, making us feel hungrier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, if you sleep poorly, you’ll have lower leptin and higher ghrelin levels, which will likely increase appetite and possibly explain the increased BMI [body mass index] observed with short sleep duration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A German study, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Sleep Research&lt;/em&gt;, showed that just one night’s broken sleep raises ghrelin levels significantly, explaining why you might have hunger cravings when you’re tired. They also showed that two nights or more of poor sleep reduces leptin levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, your appetite hormones (and mind) are scrambled through lack of sleep. That’s not great news for your weight and health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s not all – apologies, but we have further bad hormonal news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Poor sleep also lowers levels of testosterone,” says Gilchrist. “There’s clear evidence that this lowers muscle mass and increases fat mass. That’s bad enough, but that then leads to a further decrease in testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If your body mass continues to increase, this can lead to a potential sleep disorder (sleep apnoea), which further reduces sleep quality and quantity, and the cycle continues.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insufficient sleep decreases levels of human growth hormone (HGH). HGH is predominantly released during deep sleep – aka slow wave sleep – but if this is low, so is HGH secretion, which isn’t great for your weight because HGH increases muscle mass and reduces fat mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also evidence that poor sleep impacts other metabolic and endocrine processes. For instance, a decreased glucose tolerance, decreased insulin sensitivity and raised evening concentrations of the stress hormone cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s the psychological impact, too. We all know anecdotally that lack of sleep results in demotivation to undertake any activity that requires a hint of effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn’t fully understood why this is, but research suggests it’s down to your mind determining whether it has the resources needed to complete the task, deciding whether those resources are available or accessible, and whether those resources need to be used or conserved for tasks of higher priority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, sleep deprivation alters the perception of this resource distribution and makes things feel tougher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fatigue perception is highlighted further by a 1995 study in the journal &lt;em&gt;Sleep&lt;/em&gt;, where researchers deprived subjects of sleep for 48 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before and after the deprivation, the participants completed a series of physical tasks and, although they achieved the same level of physical result, the participants perceived that the workload had increased significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Boost sleep, lose weight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/09/GettyImages-532655194-2.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-941106"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Pro teams have put more emphasis on sleep in recent years. &lt;span&gt;Tim de Waele/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a bleak, sleep-deprived picture, but one that can be brightened. Which is what we’ll do now by rebooting your sleep and hormonal levels in an effort to lose a few pounds and retain your sanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How? Well, Gilchrist suggests that a cool, calm sleep environment, with a comfortable bed and the right temperature (around 18 to 20°C), will help, as will a sleep routine that’s as regular and consistent as it can be in your individual circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of you who struggle with sleep will no doubt have tried this lore of good sleep. If you have and it didn’t work, you must listen to Nick Littlehales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Littlehales is a sleep expert who shot to prominence around 20 years ago after working with numerous sports teams, including Real Madrid and Manchester United in football and Team Sky in cycling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep is the best recovery tool we possess but, said Littlehales, these multi-million outfits were neglecting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, the world’s finest sportspeople were sleeping on bespoke mattresses and toppers with portable air-conditioning units to keep the likes of Sir Bradley Wiggins at optimum sleep temperature when pursuing Tour de France glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Littlehales is a proponent of breaking sleep down into several 90-minute cycles rather than seeing it as one big chunk because, he says, the end of a sleep cycle is when the body and brain find waking easiest. Awaken mid-cycle and you’ve undone much of your good work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ideal is individual but you’re looking at four or five 90-minute cycles, but key is that you plan to awake at the end of the cycle because you’ll feel fresher,” Littlehales says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, say your wake time is 6.30am, aim to sleep by 11pm. That’s seven and a half hours, or five cycles. You can then adjust your sleep time if needed. If you have to be up early and can’t go to bed earlier, aim to sleep at 11pm and awake at 5am. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That’s six hours, or four cycles. Conversely, if you feel you need more sleep, grab yourself an extra cycle by going to sleep at 9.30pm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits of napping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/09/GettyImages-1140539003.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-941108"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Naps are a great way to catch up on missed sleep cycles. &lt;span&gt;Justin Paget/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key to Littlehales’ R90 technique is to stop thinking of sleep in a monophasic way, he says. That means your sleep must come in one block. Instead, think of it as polyphasic – more than one – which is where napping comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A 30-minute nap is the ideal if you haven’t ticked off your optimum number of cycles,” says Littlehales. “The good thing is you don’t have to fall asleep; simply switching off your mind, by sitting down and simply chilling, helps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can squeeze in a 30-minute mental shutdown, aim to do it between 1pm and 3pm. That’s because of our natural mid-afternoon slump, which contrary to popular belief doesn’t derive from a big lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, it’s down to our body temperature, which follows a distinct rhythm where it peaks in the early evening and hits a trough about two to three hours before waking up in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s also a small dip between the hours of 1pm and 3pm, which is called the post-prandial dip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A drop in body temperature will cause feelings of sleepiness,” says Littlehales, “so if you have had a bad or shortened night sleep then feelings of sleepiness during this period will be intensified in the majority of people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can even enjoy a ‘nappuccino’, whereby you consume a caffeinated product before you nap, so you feel even more alert after the 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is about making you more involved in ‘sleeping’ – you’re almost seeing it as a performance criteria like eating healthily and exercising – rather than simply waiting for it to happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, Littlehales is a keen proponent of what he calls MRMs, or micro reset moments, where like napping, you do very little. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My personal favourite is simply looking out of the window for a couple of minutes every hour or so,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just switch off and unwind. That’s so important to sleeping well and balancing out your hormones. Ultimately, the key is to be active regarding your sleep but not to put pressure on yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I remember when I worked with world-class cyclists years ago, we encouraged them to wear nasal strips to nose breathe at night and ideally help them sleep more proficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But you don’t need the extra tools as most of them are really not proven to work. These few simple steps and redefining how you see sleep will help you kip better and help you lose weight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BikeRadar</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5QWGJES1o2NFhMZS1nSE9Yc1l4d0xLbkJUajAtT3V3TlNVc0ZHRnU1UFNBM3dvNVk3STVTSG5HWklrUE5iMmQzWnlqTGpIWWRDNHl1M2piMkxtN0R6RGN6cHZIRVIxQ1V5MVcwbWZnM1U</guid></item><item><title>本周科学新闻：治疗亨廷顿舞蹈症的突破性疗法，以及突破物理学的快速增长的黑洞- Live Science</title><link>https://www.livescience.com/health/science-news-this-week-a-breakthrough-cure-for-huntingtons-disease-and-a-fast-growing-black-hole-that-breaks-physics</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto paywall-locker"&gt;

Caused by a single defective gene, the disease runs through families and appears between the ages of 30 and 50 with dementia-like symptoms that include loss of cognition and motor control. Until now, no treatments have slowed the disease's progression, and patients typically die within 10 to 25 years of it manifesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="67864f55-2d9f-469d-a393-1cca9bf1f0e3-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;The new therapy introduced a new gene into cells in the two parts of the brain hit hardest by the disease to slow its progression by 75%, marking a remarkable first in the field.

Yet beyond their physics-warping event horizons, the cosmic monsters are usually neatly constrained by theory — obeying a strict "Eddington limit" for how fast they can grow based on their outward radiation pressure and gravitational pull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's why the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/space/black-holes/shocking-black-hole-found-growing-at-2-4-times-the-theoretical-limit" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/space/black-holes/shocking-black-hole-found-growing-at-2-4-times-the-theoretical-limit"&gt;&lt;u&gt;discovery of a giant black hole growing at 2.4 times this limit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; caught astrophysicists off guard.

"As we get older, body weight alone tends to be best. I also tell patients to monitor worsening pain. Muscle soreness is normal, but worsening pain in the joints is not good, as that indicates something going on inside the knee that needs to be seen by a doctor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Overall, taking the time to do knee strengthening exercises serves as a valuable investment in your long-term health. We might take our knees for granted, but they let us walk, skip, jump and run, until they fail. As Baz Luhrmann wisely advised in the song Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen): "Be kind to your knees. You'll miss them when they're gone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;i id="for-trusted-insights-into-better-health-and-wellbeing-rooted-in-science,-sign-up-to-the" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;For trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://cloud.email.bbc.com/HealthFix_Newsletter_Signup?&amp;amp;at_bbc_team=studios&amp;amp;at_medium=emails&amp;amp;at_objective=acquisition&amp;amp;at_ptr_type=&amp;amp;at_ptr_name=bbc.com&amp;amp;at_format=Module&amp;amp;at_link_origin=featurescallout&amp;amp;at_campaign=healthfix&amp;amp;at_campaign_type=owned" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;&lt;i id="health-fix-newsletter" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;Health Fix newsletter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i id="while" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;while &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://cloud.email.bbc.com/SignUp10_08?&amp;amp;at_bbc_team=studios&amp;amp;at_medium=Onsite&amp;amp;at_objective=acquisition&amp;amp;at_ptr_name=bbc.com&amp;amp;at_link_origin=featuresarticle&amp;amp;at_campaign=essentiallist&amp;amp;at_campaign_type=owned" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;&lt;i id="the-essential-list" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;The Essential List&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="delivers-a-handpicked-selection-of-features-and-insights." class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt; delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 10:04:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFBxSkkwZ2toMW1KSjNqTTJaY1F2dWFVbnhGX2dLb3JGVDBmWG9pd1ZoaVlPWDB6T2NiZ0xFVmpJendPN25HSkx3TWVHbk50VGp4SGhfWGxZV2laZnZSRi1KWjU5ZXJCOVRkcVpSQ051OGlQV1hVeTktZ2l4YnJyZw</guid></item><item><title>玛格丽特·斯泰尔斯博士被评为弗吉尼亚州社区医疗保健协会年度供应商- Shore Daily News</title><link>https://shoredailynews.com/headlines/dr-margaret-stiles-named-virginia-community-healthcare-association-provider-of-the-year/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="x-the-content entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pictured: Dr. Margaret Stiles on the job at Eastern Shore Rural Health’s Express Care. Dr. Stiles was named the Virginia Community Healthcare Association Provider of the Year at VCHA’s 2025 annual conference in Roanoke Sept. 24-26.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eastern Shore Rural Health System, Inc. is proud to announce that Dr. Margaret Stiles has been honored as the Virginia Community Healthcare Association Provider of the Year, recognizing her extraordinary dedication, clinical excellence, and compassionate care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Stiles accepted the role of Clinical Director of Express Care in June 2024, moving from Primary Care at Onley Community Health Center where she had been since joining the organization. Since then, she has led the urgent care center through significant staffing transitions with unwavering calm and resilience. Her leadership has been instrumental in maintaining a seven-day-a-week schedule, balancing the needs of both part-time and full-time providers, and often stepping in herself—working most Sundays and holidays to ensure her team has time with their families.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond her clinical duties, Dr. Stiles is known for her creative and heartfelt efforts to boost morale. From her daily “chocolate o’clock” tradition to sharing her favorite “cheese crack” from Norfolk, she brings warmth and camaraderie to the workplace. Her waterfront home has become the cherished venue for Express Care’s annual anniversary celebrations, further strengthening team spirit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her commitment to public health was especially evident during a local H5N1 avian flu exposure earlier this year. On her scheduled day off, Dr. Stiles immediately responded to an emergency call, helping to establish a mobile unit workflow and ensuring exposed patients received timely antiviral treatment. Her swift action and leadership were critical in managing the situation safely and effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

The Eastern Shore Health District provided its mobile unit for the response.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Dr. Stiles was honored to have been selected as this year’s recipient for the award. She came from a true private practice prior to joining Rural Health. Now five years into her career with Rural Health, she states she is proud of the work community health center work here on the Shore and the impact it makes at the state and national levels. Her compassionate approach led to a safe resolution and support for the family, showcasing her deep understanding of both medical and social complexities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past fiscal year, Dr. Stiles completed 3,276 medical encounters, with more than half serving patients at or below the Federal Poverty Level. She has expanded access to advanced procedures such as joint injections and dermatologic treatments, mentoring other providers to do the same—ensuring high-quality care reaches those who need it most in this medically underserved region.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Dr. Stiles exemplifies the values of the VCHA Provider of the Year Award: dedication, expertise, and compassionate care. Her tireless service, clinical excellence, and unwavering commitment to her patients and colleagues make her a true role model in community healthcare,” said Rural Health CEO Jeannette Edwards. “We congratulate her on this well-deserved recognition and thank her for her continued service to the Eastern Shore community.”&lt;/p&gt;

Fentanyl overdoses, in particular, are expected to fall to a near 10-year low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JGIFXIBNOZD7LMXU5TKTDP3RQE"&gt;But that progress could largely be offset by an increase in cocaine deaths – again, some mixed with opioids – which is projected to kill 399 Cuyahogans by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="F6JFDKF3FNEQZM22KVVM4NS46Y"&gt;“This is the problem that we’re living with now,” Gilson said of the moment. “Opiates aren’t going to go away, but if you define an epidemic as a disease that’s occurring at a higher incidence rate in the population than baseline, well, we’ve had two years of decline; so, it’s pretty hard to say, ‘I’m still living in the opioid epidemic.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The shift&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4G3IXJSF6ZANPBE2OJV57LGPTA"&gt;Opioid-related deaths, especially involving fentanyl, have been falling sharply over the last three years. Last year, overdose deaths dropped below 500 for the first time in a decade. &lt;a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2024/12/overdose-deaths-dropped-drastically-in-cuyahoga-county-this-year-officials-cant-explain-why.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;&lt;u&gt;The reason still isn’t clear.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6JOJESHUWVFBDPRJ7TEEY6J63Y"&gt;It could be that the fentanyl supply is shrinking, or that what is circulating on the street is less potent, with smaller amounts showing up in drug mixtures, Gilson said. It could also be intervention strategies and overdose reversal drugs are working to curb deaths. Gilson suspects younger generations have started shying away from the drug, after years of warnings about its lethal effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DGEMS3GN7ZFU7AIASCFGO77GLQ"&gt;Regardless, he worried that the lull was only leaving the door open for something else. Something new. It turns out, it was actually something old – though thankfully less lethal: cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5VZRXSS22ZDUZBLKTEX7EI6HUE"&gt;Gilson recalled the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and early 1990s, which devastated many urban communities and coincided with a major crime wave. The crisis helped fuel the “tough-on-crime” era, leading to harsh sentencing laws and mass incarceration that disproportionately affected Black Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KWL4QG62FVEB7PC6U77US5UC4A"&gt;Back then the drug was killing 100-150 people a year in the county – a number which pales in comparison to the 600-700 who were dying at the peak of the opioid crisis. Now, though, the numbers are ticking upward again, and faster, partly fueled by cocaine-opioid mixtures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NOLQ3RXW5REB3JDQ5ISF7VSZKI"&gt;In August, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/pdfs/mm7432-H.pdf" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;&lt;u&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; noting a rise in overdose deaths involving stimulants, like cocaine and methamphetamine, since 2011. Though it primarily attributed the increase to opioid mixtures, it noted that “stimulant-involved deaths without opioid co-involvement have also increased.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2YNUTQXLQNE27LOAWZEFR3NZIM"&gt;The CDC urged expanded access to evidence-based treatment for stimulant use disorder, along with outreach to people “who might be missed by opioid-focused prevention efforts.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RBKVTT2275AA7CAPFN3XDDPPNQ"&gt;After seeing the shift locally, Gilson is sounding his own alarm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16" data-gaid="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SY66ZKG6ZNAGHDIQOEWDQQJLXQ"&gt;“Things are changing, and the demographics of who’s affected by it is changing, too,” Gilson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17" data-gaid="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;New strategies?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18" data-gaid="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IGVVZWY2TBETPOCTHNXB3C7SEI"&gt;In the early phases of the opioid epidemic, particularly with prescription painkillers, white communities bore the brunt of overdose deaths. Even as the crisis evolved and overall numbers leveled out, Gilson’s office continued to record higher rates of fentanyl and opioid fatalities among white residents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-19" data-gaid="inarticle-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article__image"&gt;&lt;div class="article__image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 500px)" srcset="https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/WHHNBGTL2FFMPF7CYX22TESVK4.jpg?auth=a4e12a58ba9ed24974a0c48455473c485cc7f81f8a90d69287209a88229a6656&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;smart=true&amp;amp;quality=90 500w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/WHHNBGTL2FFMPF7CYX22TESVK4.jpg?auth=a4e12a58ba9ed24974a0c48455473c485cc7f81f8a90d69287209a88229a6656&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;smart=true&amp;amp;quality=90 800w" sizes="80vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/WHHNBGTL2FFMPF7CYX22TESVK4.jpg?auth=a4e12a58ba9ed24974a0c48455473c485cc7f81f8a90d69287209a88229a6656&amp;amp;width=1280&amp;amp;smart=true&amp;amp;quality=90 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, (max-width: 800px) 80vw, 60vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="Overdose deaths" class="hero-image" src="https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/WHHNBGTL2FFMPF7CYX22TESVK4.jpg?auth=a4e12a58ba9ed24974a0c48455473c485cc7f81f8a90d69287209a88229a6656&amp;amp;width=1280&amp;amp;smart=true&amp;amp;quality=90"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article__image-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="article__mm-image-caption-text"&gt;Overdose data through the first half of the year shows a rise in cocaine-related deaths, especially among Black men.&lt;span class="article__mm-image-credit"&gt;(Courtesy of the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner's Office)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-20" data-gaid="inarticle-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FVVQJ2YFZRHSXBCUUCRHA5O6QQ"&gt;However, the rise in cocaine overdoses is disproportionately affecting the Black community, echoing patterns seen in the 1980s and 1990s. In the first half of this year, overdose deaths among white residents declined compared to 2024, while the share among Black residents rose from 42% to 48%. Black men, in particular, were impacted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-21" data-gaid="inarticle-21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SAXFSHZCXNBKDFAVB27PU4CISE"&gt;“We’re reverting back to a pre-opioid phase,” Gilson said. “And that means we’re going to see another racial disparity develop like we did before.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-22" data-gaid="inarticle-22"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="R5DLTEDDFNEDNCOLVQJXOYSWG4"&gt;That makes directing prevention and treatment outreach specifically to Black communities both more urgent and more challenging, he said. He noted it was harder to reach Black communities with prevention messaging during the opioid epidemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-23" data-gaid="inarticle-23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HVVMD7YLI5AF5O5YIYQLOFA26A"&gt;And that challenge raises a bigger question: whether current prevention and treatment strategies would be adequate, given decades of opioid-focused efforts. Unlike fentanyl, which can be reversed with naloxone, there is no antidote for cocaine overdoses, which often result in sudden heart attacks or strokes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-24" data-gaid="inarticle-24"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XZIHM4NDZNFSNJYXI7R3NNT62M"&gt;(Earlier this year, Gilson also flagged the need for &lt;a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2025/04/homicides-and-overdose-deaths-were-down-in-2024-but-suicides-went-up-what-does-this-mean-for-prevention-strategies.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;&lt;u&gt;better prevention strategies to address rising suicide rates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-25" data-gaid="inarticle-25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5PF6TLHX5ZANZIDEYO47LPQO5I"&gt;One strategy Gilson said he knows can help save lives is reminding people not to use drugs alone. He reiterated a recent &lt;a href="https://www.cleveland.com/metro/2024/09/majority-of-overdose-victims-in-cuyahoga-county-died-alone-according-to-new-case-western-reserve-university-research.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;&lt;u&gt;study by Case Western Reserve University&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that found that about 75% of overdose victims over a five-year period were using alone, increasing death rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-26" data-gaid="inarticle-26"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UZGYSWNXZRFPXEACJZQHQQMFVI"&gt;But what other strategies may be needed to save lives remains an open question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-27" data-gaid="inarticle-27"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RV6IBWLWDFBSJLYA2NSSMBYAJI"&gt;“The winds are changing,” Gilson said. “If we want to really be effective, we need to start pivoting to these stimulants as enemy number one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-28" data-gaid="inarticle-28"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:C5SXBBBZUFEMBGTE5K3J26WZWM" data-fusion-component="C5SXBBBZUFEMBGTE5K3J26WZWM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:C5SXBBBZUFEMBGTE5K3J26WZWM" data-fusion-component="C5SXBBBZUFEMBGTE5K3J26WZWM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-29" data-gaid="inarticle-29"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--center skimlinks"&gt;If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.&lt;span&gt; By using this site, you consent to our &lt;a href="https://www.advancelocal.com/advancelocalUserAgreement/user-agreement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;User Agreement&lt;/a&gt; and agree that your clicks, interactions, and personal information may be collected, recorded, and/or stored by us and social media and other third-party partners in accordance with our &lt;a href="https://www.advancelocal.com/advancelocalUserAgreement/privacy-policy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Privacy Policy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Cleveland.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 09:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>此2秒拇指测试可以指示您是否有心脏问题的风险—以下是在家中进行测试的方法- BuzzFeed</title><link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/carolinebologna/thumb-test-heart-aortic-aneurysm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;He noted that imaging is the gold standard for diagnosing aneurysms, and there are medical guidelines that recommend testing based on assessment of certain risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If someone with a positive thumb test also has features suggestive of Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos, or a family history of aneurysm or dissection, they should discuss it with a physician who may recommend formal evaluation and imaging of the aorta,” Rambhatla said. “If it’s an isolated finding in an otherwise healthy person, it usually does not warrant urgent concern but can be brought up at a routine medical visit for context.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hirsch also recommended that people discuss risk factors with their physicians to determine when screening and monitoring is appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;

And conversely, many others with aneurysms may have a normal thumb test. Screening for aneurysm is done with imaging such as echocardiography, CT, or ultrasound ― not physical maneuvers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Manusapon Kasosod / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He believes the thumb test is “an interesting bedside sign linked to connective tissue disorders,” but otherwise can be misleading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“A positive result is nonspecific and may cause unnecessary anxiety, while a negative result may provide false reassurance to someone who actually has an aneurysm,” Rambhatla said. “Over-reliance on it could delay proper screening or surveillance with imaging in high-risk individuals. In short, it should never replace formal medical evaluation or guideline-based aneurysm screening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/scarymouse/adhd-symptoms-things-thought-normal-neurotypical?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:24 Things People With ADHD Thought Were Totally "Normal" Until A Neurotypical Person Said "Um, No, Actually";elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link "&gt;24 Things People With ADHD Thought Were Totally "Normal" Until A Neurotypical Person Said "Um, No, Actually"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;
