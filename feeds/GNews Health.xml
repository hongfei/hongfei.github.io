    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Christine Wu Nordahl, senior study author and principal investigator at the UC Davis MIND Institute, said: 'This is not about finding a single cause. It's about recognizing the whole child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Supporting gastrointestinal health is one important step toward improving overall quality of life for children with autism.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings come as one in 31 children in the US is diagnosed with autism, a stark increase from about one in 150 in the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in August in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13623613251362349#sec-2"&gt;Autism&lt;/a&gt;, looked at 475 children also enrolled in the UC Davis MIND Institute Autism Phenome Project. Of those, 322 (68 percent) were diagnosed with autism, while the remainder were neurotypical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The children were evaluated at three points: baseline (two to four years old), two years later (four to six years old) and 'middle childhood' (nine to 12 years old).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caregivers completed questionnaires about their children's potential gastrointestinal symptoms, including how often they had abdominal pain, gas, diarrhea, bloating, constipation, pain during a bowel movement, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, blood in the stool or blood in the vomit.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Parents and caregivers ranked the frequency of each symptom from one to five (ranging from 'never' to 'always'). Children with at least one current GI symptom (within the last three months) were labelled as having gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the participants formally diagnosed with a digestive condition, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which stomach acid backs up into the esophagus, was the most common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the participants with autism, 43 had reported food allergies, which may have contributed to their symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the percentage of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and those who are typically developing (TD) reporting digestive issues at different points in the study. Autistic children showed a greater likelihood throughout the study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found that 61 percent of neurotypical children never reported GIS compared to 34.5 percent of children with ASD, a 55 percent difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the initial baseline visit, 47 percent of autistic children reported GIS compared to 30 percent of typically developing participants, making children with autism 44 percent more likely to have gastrointestinal issues at this point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the second visit, 40 percent of autistic children had GIS compared to 15 percent of those in the neurotypical group,  a difference of 91 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And after the third visit, GIS was recorded in 30 percent of children with autism and seven percent of neurotypical children, more than a four-fold difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each individual gastrointestinal symptom was more common in children with autism than their neurotypical peers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Constipation was the most common symptom in the autistic group, with 32 percent of participants reporting it compared to 11 percent of typically developing children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the neurotypical group, the most common symptom was abdominal pain, seen in 12 percent of patients. Among those with autism, abdominal pain was seen in 17 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diarrhea was the second most common symptom in each group, accounting for 27 percent of children with autism and 11 percent of typically developing children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the predicted probability of children in the ASD and TD groups developing gastrointestinal issues as they age&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found that over time, children with autism were twice as likely as their neurotypical peers to develop gastrointestinal issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also noted autistic children with more gastrointestinal symptoms were more likely to have more profound autistic behaviors like repetitive behaviors, anxiety, depression, aggression, defiance, social problems and sleep issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers did not explain why gastrointestinal symptoms are more common in autistic children, but it could be because many of them only eat a select few 'safe' foods, which generally are fried, low in fiber and highly processed, increasing the risk of bloating, constipation and diarrhea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Autistic people also often have imbalances in their gut bacteria, which may increase the chances of digestive issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'Results support the need for future research to assess the presence of and persistence of GIS in children with autism throughout childhood.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They could save your life. For years I've seen how heart attacks can turn a family's world upside down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But the saddest part is in many cases the body has already given signals.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;1. Frequent nausea and dizziness &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the red flags she highlighted are frequent nausea and dizziness, which many people wrongly put down to heat, stress or exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you don't have a clear cause like pregnancy, medications, or an infection, it's time to see a doctor,' Dr Yang explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Frequent nausea and dizziness, which many people wrongly put down to heat, stress or exhaustion, are early warning signs for heart disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.heartfoundation.org.au/blog/5-warning-signs-of-a-heart-attack-you-may-not-know"&gt;Heart Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, unsteadiness, blurred vision, or sudden vomiting can all indicate circulation issues that may point to an impending attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;2. Extreme fatigue and constant headaches&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another common but overlooked sign is extreme fatigue and persistent headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Yang warned this isn't the usual tiredness from work or parenting, but a strange exhaustion that lingers even after proper rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If it's accompanied by headaches that worsen over time, she said, it could be an early indicator of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead lifestyle-ccox"&gt;3. Numbness on one side of the body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Do you suddenly feel like your arm, leg, or half of your face is falling asleep? This could be reduced blood flow or even a sign your heart isn't pumping as it should,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reduced blood flow to the heart can cause signals to merge with nerve pathways for the arm, resulting in the sensation of numbness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;According to the Heart Foundation, unsteadiness, blurred vision, or sudden vomiting can all indicate circulation issues that may point to an impending attack&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, numbness, especially if it affects one side of the body, is also a common symptom of a stroke, which also results from interrupted blood flow to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;4. Sudden change in vision &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, a sudden change in vision - double vision, blurriness or one eye suddenly failing to focus - may indicate a blocked blood vessel and should be treated as urgent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The feeling has been described as 'a curtain falling across one eye' and occurs because the blood flow disruptions form clots or plaque build up which affect the retina or the brain's visual centres. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Heart Foundation stresses that someone in Australia is hospitalised with a heart attack every nine minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While chest pain and shortness of breath are widely known symptoms, many Australians - particularly women - experience subtler signs such as dizziness, nausea, jaw or back pain, or feeling sweaty and unwell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some people may even suffer a silent heart attack, with no obvious symptoms at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Warning signs can appear alone or together, and often last at least 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Reduced blood flow to the heart can cause signals to merge with nerve pathways for the arm, resulting in the sensation of numbness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They may come on suddenly or build gradually, which is why experts say any unusual or unexplained symptom should be checked without delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The good news is there are ways to reduce your risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Heart Foundation recommends quitting smoking, exercising regularly, following a heart-healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, reducing alcohol, managing stress, and monitoring blood pressure and cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For people with diabetes, keeping blood sugar under control is critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women should also be mindful of specific risk factors such as PCOS, pregnancy complications, early menopause, autoimmune diseases, and hormone treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The professional advice is simple: listen to your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is possible to experience several of these symptoms or just one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If something feels off, don't ignore it. The earlier you act, the better your chances of survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 04:15:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>这种新疗法能让数百万美国人平静下来吗？ -加州大学旧金山分校</title><link>https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/10/430796/could-novel-therapy-calm-anxiety-millions-americans</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_narrow"&gt;&lt;p class="drop-cap"&gt;Generalized anxiety disorder affects 1 in 20 U.S. adults. Those with serious symptoms may isolate themselves to the point they rarely leave their home and are unable to work and build meaningful relationships. Standard medications may make little difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UCSF neuroscientist &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/jennifer.mitchell"&gt;Jennifer Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, develops novel therapeutics for drug and alcohol abuse, PTSD, stress, anxiety, impulsivity, and depression. She believes there’s a treatment that can do more. So far, this experimental drug has shown surprising results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is this mystery treatment? It’s the pharmaceutical formulation of LSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="font-h3"&gt;What is generalized anxiety disorder? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generalized anxiety disorder is a form of chronic anxiety that seems disproportionate to the actual events promoting that anxiety. It interferes with life on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients may have difficulty concentrating, retaining information, and making decisions, so it can be challenging to find and maintain a job, and deal with managing a home and parenting. They may suffer from depression secondary to anxiety and feel restless, keyed up, and easily fatigued. They may be reluctant to leave home because they fear situations where they could feel trapped, helpless, or humiliated.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="font-h3"&gt;How is it different from day-to-day anxiety?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hallmark of generalized anxiety disorder is that it manifests as physical symptoms. Persistent worry activates the body’s fight-or-flight response, triggering stress hormones that cause physical effects. Patients may have muscle tension and rapid breathing, and report symptoms like headaches and insomnia, ringing in the ears, and cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="font-h3"&gt;How is generalized anxiety disorder treated? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s usually treated with medications like Zoloft and Paxil that boost and stabilize the neurotransmitter serotonin, leading to reduced anxiety and enhanced emotional well-being. These medications have been found to reduce symptoms by an average of 1.25 points on the 56-point anxiety scale — insufficient to make significant difference for at least some patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="font-h3"&gt;Why LSD?   &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;LSD as well as other psychedelics, have tremendous potential to shift mood and emotions when used in a controlled, therapeutic setting. We have seen this in a previous trial of Ecstasy to treat PTSD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pharmaceutical formulation of LSD is MM120. Its primary mechanism is to promote neuroplasticity in the brain, potentially altering negative thought patterns. It also increases communication between brain regions that may address the rigid thinking that underlies GAD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="font-h3"&gt;How effective is MM120?   &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an earlier phase of the study, published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2838505"&gt;JAMA&lt;/a&gt;, the effects of a single dose of MM120 were evaluated over a 12-week period in approximately 200 participants with moderate-to-severe generalized anxiety disorder. The drug significantly alleviated symptoms, reducing them by five to six points on the anxiety scale in addition to the effects of placebo. That’s quite significant and enough to reclassify moderate generalized anxiety disorder as mild in some cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="font-h3"&gt;Were there side effects? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were carefully monitored by medical staff during the period after the drug was administered. Side effects were generally mild or moderate and included hallucinations, visual distortions, nausea, and headache. It’s important to note, these were more prevalent using the highest dosage — which we will not be using since it was found to be no more effective. Nausea is a common side effect with psychedelics, but this was reduced by restricting participants to a light breakfast and treating them proactively with an anti-nausea medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="font-h3"&gt;What challenges do you face recruiting participants for the study?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are looking for people with moderate-to-severe general anxiety disorder, so typically those with disabling symptoms who are reluctant to leave their home. Ironically, people who would best qualify are least likely to show up. Participants are screened by very skilled clinicians who probe and observe body language and carefully build a rapport. We hope this builds trust and enables participants to be vulnerable and reflective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3 class="eyebrow-title"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn More about MM120 trials&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in participating in MM120 trial sites at UCSF and other California locations, please check &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.ucsf.edu/trial/NCT06741228"&gt;this information&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Details about more MM120 trial sites can be found &lt;a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06809595"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="caption caption-drupal-media"&gt;

                                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                    &lt;div class="hsa-paywall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawaii Department of Health today said a case of mumps has been confirmed in an individual on Hawaii island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said this case is community-acquired, and not travel-related, suggesting that mumps may currently be circulating on the island. Officials are working with the individual’s family, health care providers and Hawaii County officials to identify close contacts and prevent further spread. Officials declined to specify whether the individual is an adult or child due to privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, officials want the public to know the individual attended an event at Harold H. Higashihara Park in Kailua-Kona from 4:30 and 6 p.m. on Sept. 25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who attended this even should contact DOH for guidance, and monitor themselves for symptoms until Oct. 20, which is 25 days after exposure. Anyone who develops symptoms should isolate for five days after symptom onset, and avoid contact with others, especially infants, pregnant people, and those with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with suspected mumps should also call ahead before visiting a clinic or hospital to avoid exposing others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/disease_listing/mumps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Mumps &lt;/a&gt;is a contagious viral illness that spreads through coughing, sneezing, talking, or sharing items such as cups or eating utensils.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symptoms — which typically appear 12 to 25 days after exposure — include swollen, painful salivary glands, which result in puffy cheeks or a tender jaw; fever; headache; muscle aches; tiredness; and loss of appetite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH said there is no specific treatment for mumps, and that care focuses on rest, fluids, and fever control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most people who fall ill with mumps recover fully, DOH said, it can cause serious illness in some, including inflammation of the testicles or ovaries, pancreatitis, encephalitis, meningitis, and loss of hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While mumps is preventable with vaccination, even one case is concerning because of how easily the virus spreads,” said State Epidemiologist Dr. Sarah Kemble in the news release. “We encourage all Hawaii residents to check their vaccination records and ensure they and their families are fully protected with two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All children should receive two doses of the MMR vaccine by age 6, while adults born in or after 1957 should have documentation of vaccination or a blood test showing immunity. Certain adults at higher risk of exposure may need an additional MMR dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawaii experienced a significant mumps outbreak from March 2017 through October 2018, with 1,009 confirmed cases statewide. Most cases were on Oahu, but also occurred on Kauai, Maui and Hawaii counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

By the age of 30, adults typically lose between 3% and 8% of muscle mass, with the rate accelerating each decade. After 60, muscle loss can reach up to 15%. While this natural decline may feel inevitable, research shows that strength training can counteract it, improving health, mobility, and life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, evidence suggests that “just like heart-pumping aerobic exercise, strength training also may help older adults live longer” (Harvard Health). Maintaining strong muscles supports posture, balance, and metabolic health, which collectively contribute to healthier aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Simple Workouts for Effective Muscle Building | Enhance Strength and Endurance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="22788980" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="squats" source="keywords"&gt;Squats&lt;/keyword&gt;: The body weight exercise experts recommend&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to lift heavy weights to enjoy these benefits. Body weight exercises can effectively maintain and build muscle mass, and among them, squats stand out. Squats engage multiple muscle groups, stimulate the cardiovascular system, and improve neuromotor and skeletal health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also help prevent age-related muscle loss (sarcopenia), strengthen bones, improve balance, reduce fall risk, and enhance insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Ramirez, director at Viding Castellana in Madrid, told Vogue: “If we start in childhood or youth, we get a more solid musculoskeletal formation and a strength base that will protect us all our lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even starting squats later in life can offer significant benefits, helping maintain independence and functional capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How squats support &lt;keyword id="21332343" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="healthy-aging" source="keywords"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While doing squats alone doesn’t guarantee a longer lifespan, they contribute to living stronger, more mobile, and more independent lives. Maintaining muscle strength after 50 helps protect against age-related diseases, including cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. As Harvard Health notes, the combination of aerobic and resistance training- including simple body weight exercises- can be a powerful tool for healthier aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal isn’t merely to extend lifespan but to enhance quality of life. Squats, along with other forms of strength training, equip the body to handle daily tasks, maintain independence, and reduce the risk of injuries or chronic diseases. In short, integrating squats into a regular fitness routine can help ensure that your later years are not only longer but healthier and more fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 01:13:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>科学家使用纳米颗粒逆转小鼠的阿尔茨海默氏症- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-10-scientists-reverse-alzheimer-mice-nanoparticles.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research team co-led by the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC) and West China Hospital Sichuan University (WCHSU), working with partners in the UK, has demonstrated a nanotechnology strategy that reverses Alzheimer's disease in mice.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;
     
     
     &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7587637799"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
     
&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional nanomedicine, which relies on nanoparticles as carriers for therapeutic molecules, this approach employs nanoparticles that are bioactive in their own right: "supramolecular drugs." The work has been published in &lt;i&gt;Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of targeting neurons directly, the therapy restores the proper function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the vascular gatekeeper that regulates the brain's environment. By repairing this critical interface, the researchers achieved a reversal of Alzheimer's pathology in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain is the most expensive organ of the body, consuming 20% of the energy in adults and up to 60% in children. This energy arrives through a vast blood supply, assured by a unique and dense vascular system where each neuron is nourished by one capillary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain contains approximately one billion capillaries, highlighting the vital role of brain vasculature in maintaining health and combating disease. These findings highlight the crucial role of vascular health, especially in diseases like dementia and Alzheimer's, where a compromised vascular system is closely linked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BBB is a cellular and physiological barrier that separates the brain from the blood flow to protect it from external dangers such as pathogens or toxins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team demonstrated that targeting a specific mechanism enables undesirable "waste proteins" produced in the brain to pass through this barrier and be eliminated in the blood flow. In Alzheimer's disease, the main "waste" protein is amyloid-β (Aβ), whose accumulation impairs the normal functioning of the neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used mouse models that are genetically programmed to produce larger amounts of Aβ protein and develop a significant cognitive decline mimicking Alzheimer's pathology. They administered only three doses of the supramolecular drugs and afterward regularly monitored the evolution of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"Only one hour after the injection, we observed a reduction of 50–60% in Aβ amount inside the brain," explains Junyang Chen, first co-author of the study, researcher at the West China Hospital of Sichuan University and Ph.D. student at University College London (UCL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most striking data were the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/therapeutic+effects/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;therapeutic effects&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers conducted various experiments to analyze the behavior of the animals and measure their memory decline over several months, covering all stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of the experiments, they treated a 12-month-old mouse (equivalent to a 60-year-old human) with the nanoparticles and analyzed its behavior after six months. The result was impressive: the animal, aged 18 months (comparable to a 90-year-old human), had recovered the behavior of a healthy mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The long-term effect comes from restoring the brain's vasculature. We think it works like a cascade: when toxic species such as amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulate, disease progresses. But once the vasculature is able to function again, it starts clearing Aβ and other harmful molecules, allowing the whole system to recover its balance," said Giuseppe Battaglia, ICREA Research Professor at IBEC, Principal Investigator of the Molecular Bionics Group and leader of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What's remarkable is that our nanoparticles act as a drug and seem to activate a feedback mechanism that brings this clearance pathway back to normal levels."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Amyloid-β clearance from the brain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Alzheimer's disease, one of the key problems is that the brain's natural clearance system for toxic species like amyloid-β stops working properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, the protein LRP1 acts as a molecular gatekeeper: it recognizes Aβ, binds to it through ligands, and ferries it across the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood-brain+barrier/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; into the bloodstream, where it can be removed. But this system is fragile. If LRP1 binds too much Aβ too tightly, the transport clogs and the protein itself gets degraded inside the brain barrier cells, leaving fewer LRP1 "carriers" available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if it binds too little, the signal is too weak to trigger transport. In both cases, the result is the same: Aβ builds up inside the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supramolecular drugs developed in this work act like a switch that resets the system. By mimicking the ligands of LRP1, they can bind to Aβ, cross the blood–brain barrier, and initiate the process of removing toxic species from the brain. In doing so, they help restore the vasculature's natural role as a waste-clearing pathway and bring it back to proper function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Nanoparticles to treat Alzheimer's&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers introduce nanoparticles that act as supramolecular drugs, therapeutic agents in their own right rather than carriers of medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designed with a bottom-up molecular engineering approach, these nanoparticles combine precise size control with a defined number of surface ligands, creating a multivalent platform able to interact with cellular receptors in a highly specific way. By engaging receptor trafficking at the cell membrane, they open up a unique and novel way to modulate receptor function.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;This precision not only enables the effective clearance of amyloid-β from the brain but also restores balance to the vascular system that maintains healthy brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This innovative therapeutic paradigm offers a promising pathway for developing effective clinical interventions, addressing vascular contributions to Alzheimer's disease, and ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study demonstrated remarkable efficacy in achieving rapid Aβ clearance, restoring healthy function in the blood–brain barrier and leading to a striking reversal of Alzheimer's pathology," concludes Lorena Ruiz Perez, researcher at the Molecular Bionics group from the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC) and Serra Hunter Assistant Professor at the University of Barcelona (UB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was a collaboration among the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalunya (IBEC), West China Hospital of Sichuan University, West China Xiamen Hospital of Sichuan University, University College London, the Xiamen Key Laboratory of Psychoradiology and Neuromodulation, University of Barcelona, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA).&lt;/p&gt;

His statement referenced a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-unproven-medical-advice-tylenol-vaccines-rcna233911" target="_blank"&gt;recent comment from President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;, who advised people last month on Truth Social to “break up the MMR shot into three totally separate shots.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0ef950" class="body-graf"&gt;However, no monovalent vaccines for measles, mumps or rubella are approved in the U.S., and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" target="_blank"&gt;no published scientific evidence&lt;/a&gt; that shows a benefit to separating the combined vaccine. It is not clear whether the change O'Neill is calling for is possible or likely to come about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9aee9d" class="body-graf"&gt;Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said “standalone vaccinations can potentially reduce the risk of side effects and can maximize parental choice in childhood immunizations.” He did not offer evidence for his statement about side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d349a2" class="body-graf"&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine has been available as a combination shot since 1971, in part to reduce the number of injections that children receive, given that the three are administered at the same ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd4ee2" class="body-graf"&gt;Breaking up the MMR vaccine, a two-dose regimen in which the first shot is recommended at 12 to 15 months and the second at 4 to 6 years, would mean that children would receive six injections instead of two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-bc1792"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1618" data-original-width="2500"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251006-mmr-shot-gk-0b1017.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251006-mmr-shot-gk-0b1017.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251006-mmr-shot-gk-0b1017.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251006-mmr-shot-gk-0b1017.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251006-mmr-shot-gk-0b1017.jpg" alt="Vial of MMR vaccine."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;A vial of MMR vaccine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Joe Raedle / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1fb9e2" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s unclear where Trump’s advice came from.

It seems to be that when you mix them, there could be a problem. So there’s no downside in taking them separately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-743905" class="body-graf"&gt;Merck, the pharmaceutical company that has manufactured the MMR vaccine since 1971, said in a statement that use of individual vaccines “increases the number of injections for the individual and may result in delayed or missed immunizations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-43658e" class="body-graf"&gt;At the same time, the company added, “&lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28881166/__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!o46VHBzaZBbEGeQHqzVRFQHPxefAvu-TQ60Y-Blsho5Pqr0xSCQj7byRdXAjS9QqqkNVs3JKWXA13lvdXnvbk8DN9g$" target="_blank"&gt;evidence suggests &lt;/a&gt;that use of combination vaccines improves childhood vaccination outcomes, increasing both completion (receipt of all recommended doses) and compliance (age-appropriate administration) rates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f2d7b2" class="body-graf"&gt;The U.S. has recorded more &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-minnesota-double-us-outbreaks-vaccine-continue-rcna235144" target="_blank"&gt;measles cases&lt;/a&gt; this year &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-cases-reach-highest-point-disease-was-eliminated-us-2000-rcna201421" target="_blank"&gt;than in any other since 2000&lt;/a&gt;, when the country eliminated the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e91783" class="body-graf"&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who in the past founded an anti-vaccine group, has repeatedly &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/health-secretary-rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-falsely-claims-wanes-rcna200636" target="_blank"&gt;made false claims&lt;/a&gt; about measles vaccines, including that they haven’t been “safety tested” and that their protection is short-lived. However, Kennedy has also said that people should get the vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4dc97b" class="body-graf"&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services has already moved to limit access to a combination MMR and chickenpox vaccine for children. The CDC’s vaccine advisory committee recommended on Sept. 18 against that vaccine for children under 4. O’Neill, who is also the deputy health secretary, signed off on the recommendation last week. (Most pediatricians already give young children the chickenpox vaccine and MMR vaccine separately.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8d62db" class="body-graf"&gt;The committee’s recommendation was based on an increased risk of febrile seizures (seizures prompted by fevers that tend to resolve quickly), which doctors had known about for years. Combination MMR and chickenpox vaccines can still be given to older kids, since there is no evidence of an increased risk of febrile seizure in that age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d16282" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Trump said at the White House event days later that he was “very happy” that chickenpox vaccines would be administered separately from MMR vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 22:20:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxOT3N3c1VQeFhNSEIzM291ZkVQNHJBZ1EwQ1BGLUhNRjFRYWRUZG9vRWhSVGtaVHgyaEh3Q0xFN0dFU2hVNm5IMlpiUC0tdjFkU0JsczRqQkJ0Q0VTYkJ2TWRaaHdzNTNlQ1duXzR0S2VYYWdib1NMeHlVOWdYWUh2MnZmY2NZMnQ3U0xlZzBuZEtUR0xYc2k2Y1psUUtZdlRvYWtTY21STEU4aDNRMkFKbzZ30gFWQVVfeXFMUEdreG9nNldRVUFOd0pzbWo5TGNyV2k5LWJTSVJNMmpFYXRRWE1JZi1yVFJ6bmlPY2U5UWV3R1VlOGlxUjlEN01IcDNhbEhEZ05LeUVYV0E</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，每天只喝一罐健怡可乐或雪碧可使罹患致命肝病的风险高达60% --《每日邮报》</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15165803/sugar-drink-liver-disease-diet-masld-coke-sprite.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drinking just one can of fizzy drink per day—diet or full-fat—could dramatically raise the risk of developing deadly liver disease, concerning research today suggested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Known medically as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), the condition is not linked to heavy drinking—the more commonly known cause of liver problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, MASLD occurs when excess fat builds up inside the liver, and it is said to be on the rise in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, Chinese researchers have discovered just 250ml of fizzy drinks per day — less than one can — was enough to raise the risk of MASLD by up to 60 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists, who analysed the diets of more than 123,000 British adults, found those who guzzled sugar-sweetened drinks like Coca-Cola had a 50 per cent increased likelihood of developing the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By comparison, low or non-sugar-sweetened drinks such as Diet Coke or Sprite Zero Sugar, raised the risk of MASLD by 60 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts, today, said the findings suggested 'diet' alternatives could be more harmful to liver health than thought and urged health officials to 'reconsider' their role in healthy diets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lihe Liu, a gastroenterology researcher at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University in Suzhou, said: 'Sugar sweetened beverages have long been under scrutiny, while their 'diet' alternatives are often seen as the healthier choice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-module-version="1.16.0" data-dataset-id="2057" data-mol-fe-xpmodule-newsletter-sign-up data-newsletter="configurable" data-form-action-url="https://link.news.dailymail.co.uk/s/Health" data-environment="production" data-newsletter-id="Health" data-newsletter-channel-colour="health" data-watermark="uk" data-image="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2025/09/25/SignUpModule_Image_Health.png" data-title="Sign up for our free Health newsletter" data-subtitle="Transform your health every Tuesday with expert guides, real-life stories and advice from top doctors"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Known medically as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), the condition is not linked to heavy drinking—the more commonly known cause of liver problems &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also discovered that replacing either sugar sweetened or low or non-sugar-sweetened drinks with water, significantly reduced MASLD risk by 12.8 and 15.2 per cent respectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists believe this may be because sugar sweetened drinks dramatically affect blood glucose levels, while low or non-sugar sweetened drinks could alter the gut microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The higher sugar content in sugar sweetened beverages can cause rapid spikes in blood glucose and insulin, promote weight gain and increase uric acid levels, all of which contribute to liver fat accumulation,' Liu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Low or non-sugar sweetened beverages, on the other hand, may affect liver health by altering the gut microbiome, disrupting the feeling of fullness, driving sweet cravings and even stimulating insulin secretion.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research will be presented in full at the United European Gastroenterology annual congress in Berlin on October 7. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers now aim to further investigate how sugar and its substitutes interact with the gut microbiome to influence liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The British Liver Trust estimates MASLD may now affect one in five people in the UK—though experts have warned the true figure could be as high as 40 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Worryingly, around 80 per cent of those affected remain undiagnosed, as the disease often has no obvious symptoms—or it has symptoms that are mistaken for less serious problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In most cases, it is only spotted during routine blood tests or liver function tests carried out for unrelated issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Philip Newsome, Director of the Roger Williams Institute of Liver Studies at King's College London &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15087925/deadly-liver-disease-cause-treatment.html"&gt;previously told the Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt;: 'People who develop MASLD are often overweight or have diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We're seeing an increase in liver disease in the UK, and the challenge is that symptoms are often unnoticeable until it's too late.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added that it's a common and dangerous misconception that only alcohol can cause liver scarring, as excess fat and uncontrolled blood sugar levels can lead to the same outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A team of U.K. scientists reviewed data from clinical trials and found that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/get-vitamin-d-without-supplement-11806255" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D2—the plant-based version&lt;/a&gt; often found in fortified foods and some supplements—may actually &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7950001/signs-you-might-have-a-vitamin-d-deficiency/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lower levels of vitamin D3&lt;/a&gt;, the form your body naturally makes from sunlight.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The new findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrition Reviews&lt;/em&gt;, raise fresh questions about whether the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/get-vitamin-d-without-supplement-11806255" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;two versions of vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; are interchangeable. Let’s break down what the researchers found.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-the-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was the Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To explore how vitamin D2 might affect vitamin D3 levels, researchers from the University of Surrey, John Innes Centre and Quadram Institute Bioscience searched the PubMed database for studies published between January 1975 and February 2023. They found 202 articles, then narrowed those down to 20 that met their criteria. In the end, the researchers included 11 studies in their detailed statistical analysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Each study was a randomized controlled trial, meaning participants were randomly assigned to take vitamin D2 or not. The researchers compared vitamin D3 levels in the blood before and after supplementation to see how they changed. This approach helped reveal whether a consistent pattern appeared across studies—in this case, whether taking vitamin D2 affected vitamin D3 levels in the body.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People who took &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vitamin-d-heart-disease-study-11762480" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D2 supplements&lt;/a&gt; saw a noticeable drop in vitamin D3 levels compared with those who didn’t. On average, serum levels of vitamin D3 fell by about 18 nanomoles per liter by the end of the study period and about 9 nanomoles per liter when researchers looked at overall change during the trials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because this pattern showed up across several randomized controlled studies, the results suggest a real cause-and-effect link—taking vitamin D2 appears to lower vitamin D3 levels in the body.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers say more work is needed to understand exactly how this happens, but the findings add to the growing evidence that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-time-to-take-vitamin-d-for-maximum-absorption-11743667" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D3 may be the better option&lt;/a&gt; for most people &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/conditions-when-you-need-vitamin-d-supplement-8576496" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;when choosing a supplement&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you take a vitamin D supplement, this research shows that the type you choose really does matter. Both D2 and D3 can boost overall vitamin D levels, but D3 seems to do a better job of keeping those levels steady and supporting your health long term.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can also get some &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-vitamin-d-than-an-egg-8732396" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D from food&lt;/a&gt;, though natural sources are limited. Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel and sardines are among the best options, along with egg yolks, beef liver and mushrooms exposed to UV light. Many everyday foods, such as milk, plant-based milks, yogurt and breakfast cereals, are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8025336/vitamin-d-added-to-your-favorite-cereal-heres-why/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fortified to help fill the gap&lt;/a&gt;—but it can still be hard to meet daily needs through diet alone.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you’re concerned about reaching your goal intake, considering talking to a health care professional about starting a supplement. They may even have a recommendation for you on which one to snag at the pharmacy or grocery store.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And for anyone who follows a vegan or plant-based diet, there’s good news: vegan vitamin D3 made from lichen—a natural, non-animal source—is available and works more like traditional D3.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This research adds weight to what smaller studies have hinted for years: vitamin D3 appears to be the more effective form of vitamin D for maintaining healthy levels in the body. The consistent drop in D3 seen after D2 supplementation suggests the two forms don’t work the same way, and that they shouldn’t be treated as interchangeable. While D2 can still raise total vitamin D to some degree, this analysis shows it may also cause D3 levels to fall. Until researchers understand why this happens, it makes sense to consider D3 the more reliable option for most people. Talk to a health care professional if you’re considering starting a vitamin D supplement or wondering if you’re taking the right one for your needs.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests that B vitamins may help lower the risk of disabling dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers connected riboflavin (vitamin B2) with a 49% lower risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The study only captured vitamin intake from food and drink, not supplements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You know that moment when you open the pantry and can’t remember what you came looking for? Most of us shrug off those little lapses, but they still spark the same quiet question: Is there anything I can do now to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-are-aging-your-brain-11717608" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;help my brain age well&lt;/a&gt;? Diet is one of the few levers we actually control, and a new study suggests that some &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-vitamin-b-complex-8669791" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;humble B vitamins&lt;/a&gt;, the kind you’ll find in everyday foods, may matter more than we think.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers in Japan followed adults for more than 15 years and just reported in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; that people who ate the most riboflavin (vitamin B2) had up to a 49% lower risk of developing disabling dementia than those who ate the least. Folate and vitamin B6 also tracked with lower risk, while vitamin B12 didn’t show a clear link. It’s an intriguing pattern that fits what we already know about B vitamins: they’re workhorses in energy metabolism and help regulate homocysteine, a compound tied to vascular and brain health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; No single nutrient is a magic shield, and this study can’t prove cause and effect. But it does add a real-world, long-term data point to the idea that what’s on your plate can support your brain over the decades. Here’s what the researchers did, what they found and how to turn those insights into everyday meals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers analyzed data from the community-based Circulatory Risk in Communities Study (CIRCS), which enrolled 4,171 Japanese adults ages 40 to 69. Diet was assessed by trained dietitians using a standardized 24-hour dietary recall. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Participants were then followed for a median of 15.4 years. They tracked new cases of dementia serious enough to require daily help, using Japan’s national long-term care insurance records—a trusted source researchers rely on. They compared people who ate the least B vitamins to those who ate the most and calculated their chances of developing dementia, accounting for factors like age, sex, body size, smoking, drinking, medications, and diet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Riboflavin stood out: compared with the group with the lowest intake, the highest-intake group had about a 49% lower risk of disabling dementia. People who got more &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/diabetes-vitamin-deficiency-study-8784014" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin B6 and folate&lt;/a&gt; also tended to have a lower chance of dementia (by about 20%), while B12 didn’t stand out. The riboflavin and B6 connections were stronger among participants who had never had a stroke, hinting that these vitamins could be relevant for non-vascular forms of dementia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like all studies, this one had certain limitations. Diet was captured from a single 24-hour recall, B-vitamin supplements weren’t recorded and the researchers couldn’t distinguish Alzheimer’s disease from other dementia subtypes. There were also gaps in surveillance timing in some communities—though sensitivity checks suggested the main findings were robust. As an observational study, the results show association, not causation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While no single nutrient can prevent dementia, this study supports a food-first approach that regularly supplies &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-vitamin-b12-than-beef-11776277" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;B-vitamin–rich choices&lt;/a&gt;. Some of those foods may already be waiting for you in your fridge and pantry—here are just a few:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Riboflavin (B2)&lt;/strong&gt; is found in dairy (milk, yogurt), eggs, lean meats and fish, mushrooms, almonds and spinach.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin B6&lt;/strong&gt; can be found in poultry, salmon, potatoes, bananas, chickpeas and squash.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Folate&lt;/strong&gt; is a key nutrient in leafy greens (spinach, romaine), asparagus, avocado, citrus, beans and lentils and fortified grains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And there are plenty of practical ways to incorporate these foods and the beneficial nutrients they offer into your eating plan. For instance, you can build a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/260740/rainbow-buddha-bowl-with-cashew-tahini-sauce/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;grain bowl with lentils&lt;/a&gt;, sauteed greens and salmon and bring it along to work for lunch. Or try tossing chickpeas into a spinach salad, like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/275918/apple-cranberry-spinach-salad-with-goat-cheese/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Apple-Cranberry Spinach Salad with Goat Cheese&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At breakfast, choose &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031247/healthy-whole-grains-to-eat-more-fiber/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fortified whole-grain cereal&lt;/a&gt; with milk and sliced banana, or opt for eggs with greens. For snacks, try yogurt with crushed almonds or hummus with veggies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because the study didn’t assess supplements and more isn’t always better, check with your healthcare provider before starting a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-time-to-take-b-complex-vitamins-11779582" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;B-complex supplement&lt;/a&gt;. Focus on &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;consistent, varied eating patterns&lt;/a&gt; rich in plants, whole grains, and lean proteins. That pattern naturally delivers the B vitamins highlighted here along with fiber and other &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrients-after-60-11799297" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;brain-supportive nutrients&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In a large Japanese cohort followed for more than 15 years, higher intakes of riboflavin—and to a lesser extent vitamin B6 and folate—were linked with a lower risk of disabling dementia, while vitamin B12 showed no significant association. It’s another nudge toward a balanced diet that routinely includes &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/complete-guide-to-vitamins-in-everyday-foods-11809348" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;B-vitamin–rich foods&lt;/a&gt; as part of a broader brain-healthy lifestyle.&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Researchers recently discovered that eight different psychiatric conditions share a common genetic basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published this year pinpointed specific variants among those shared genes and shows how they behave during brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US team found many of these variants remain active for extended periods, potentially influencing multiple developmental stages – and offering new targets for treatments that could address several disorders at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-traces-autisms-origin-to-the-rise-of-human-intelligence"&gt;Study Traces Autism's Origin to The Rise of Human Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The proteins produced by these genes are also highly connected to other proteins," &lt;a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/genetics/eight-psychiatric-disorders-share-the-same-genetic-causes-study-says/"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; University of North Carolina geneticist Hyejung Won in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Changes to these proteins in particular could ripple through the network, potentially causing widespread effects on the brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2019, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.11.020"&gt;an international team&lt;/a&gt; first identified 109 genes linked in different combinations with eight psychiatric disorders:  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="176502" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="176502" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="176502" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, Tourette syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and anorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may explain why these conditions often co-occur – for example &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389%2Ffpsyt.2022.837424"&gt;up to 70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of individuals diagnosed with autism or ADHD have the other too  – and why they frequently cluster in families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_150776" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-150776" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/HumanPrecurserNeuronsDay11WithDifferentProteinMarkersStainedInRedAndGreen-e1738614042645-642x212.jpg" alt="These Eight Psychiatric Disorders Have a Surprising Genetic Connection" class="wp-image-150776 size-medium" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-150776" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Human precursor neurons with protein expression stained in different colors, indicating the type of neurons developing. (Won et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these eight conditions also has gene differences that are unique to them individually, so Won and team compared the unique genes with those shared between the disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They took almost 18,000 variations of the shared and unique genes involved and put them into the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"&gt;precursor cells&lt;/a&gt; that become our neurons to see how they could impact gene expression in these cells during human development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This allowed the researchers to identify 683 genetic variants that impacted gene regulation and to further explore them in neurons from developing mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic variants behind multiple seemingly unrelated traits, or in this case conditions, are called&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiotropy"&gt; pleiotropic&lt;/a&gt;. The pleiotropic variants were involved in many more protein-to-protein interactions than the gene variants unique to specific psychological conditions, and they were active across more types of brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164084" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164084" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-642x642.jpg" alt="Several Psychiatric Disorders Share The Same Root Cause, Study Finds" class="size-medium wp-image-164084" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-642x642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-600x600.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164084" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;This simple genotype-phenotype map only shows additive pleiotropy effects.

"CDC's 2022 blanket recommendation for perpetual COVID-19 boosters deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination for the individual patient or parent. That changes today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, all Americans are tasked with consulting with their healthcare providers to decide if they should get a seasonal COVID-19 booster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes follow recommendations made by the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/new-cdc-advisers-scale-back-recommendations-mmrv-vaccine-young-kids"&gt;&lt;u&gt;last month&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and are meant to place "shared clinical decision making" at the forefront of vaccine administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision called 'misleading'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/dr_demetre/status/1975275749083943245"&gt;&lt;u&gt;On X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, former director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Demetre Daskalakis, MD, MPH, said the announcement was misleading.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vaccinators may require proof of a discussion with a clinical before vaccination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All vaccines come with shared deciding making between patients and clinicians, he said. But under the new CDC recommendation, "Vaccinators may require proof of a discussion with a clinical before vaccination. In many states that means getting a prescription with a diagnosis code before a vaccine will be administered.&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;This means that pharmacists, in some states, aren't given the authority to share in decision making."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daskalakis added, "All vaccination involves discussion. The acting director is showing his lack of experience in the clinical or policy space and is purposefully trying to say, 'finally clinicians have to talk to their patients.' "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HHS press release said the COVID-19 vaccines will continue to be covered by both private and public insurers.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chickenpox vaccine already given separately to 85%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommendation for standalone varicella vaccination comes after ACIP was presented evidence by the CDC Immunization Safety Office showing that 12- to 23-month-old toddlers had an increased risk of febrile seizure 7 to 10 days after vaccination for the combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine compared to those given immunization for chickenpox separately.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the HHS, the combination vaccine doubles the risk of febrile seizures without conferring additional protection from varicella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combined vaccine was licensed in 2005 to promote increased vaccine uptake, but currently only &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/new-cdc-advisers-scale-back-recommendations-mmrv-vaccine-young-kids"&gt;&lt;u&gt;15% of US parents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; choose it for&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;children ages 12 to 15 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I commend the doctors and public health experts of ACIP for educating Americans about important vaccine safety signals," O'Neill said. "I also thank President Trump for his leadership in making sure we protect children from unintended side effects during routine immunization."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NY state extends executive order for pharmacists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In related developments, yesterday New York Governor Kathy Hochul signed an extension to an executive order allowing pharmacists in the state to administer COVID-19 vaccines for an additional 30 days without a prescription under a standing order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I will sign as many extensions of this executive order as I need to," &lt;a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-extends-executive-order-ensuring-all-new-yorkers-can-receive-updated-2025-26"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hochul said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

POTS causes a rapid heartbeat when standing up after lying down and sometimes at rest and during exercise. Because standing up triggers dizziness, affected patients prefer to sit or lie down (orthostatic intolerance). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A third had chronic diseases before infection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Karolinska Institutet investigators prospectively evaluated the prevalence and clinical effects of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) in 467 nonhospitalized patients who took sick leave from work at least half of the time because of persistent COVID-19 symptoms. The team also compared demographic factors and clinical outcomes among those diagnosed as having POTS with those without the heart-rhythm disorder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A median of 12 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, patients underwent physical testing and completed health forms. Those who showed signs of POTS met with a cardiologist, who performed 48-hour electrocardiography, the 6-minute walk test, head-up tilt testing, and the active stand test. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An increase in heart rate of at least 30 beats per minute after moving from the supine (lying face up) or upright position without orthostatic hypotension and a symptom duration of at least 3 months after ruling out other conditions was diagnostic of POTS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of all participants, 84% were women, and 32% had chronic diseases before their COVID-19 infection, with asthma (16%) and obesity (15%) being most common.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Less physical activity, capacity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In total, 31% of all long-COVID patients were diagnosed as having POTS, 27% didn't meet the criteria for the condition, and 42% had no clinical signs of POTS. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Patients with a POTS diagnosis were nearly all women (91%) and younger than those who didn't meet the criteria or had no signs (average age, 40.0 vs 44.0 vs 47.0 years, respectively). Most middle-aged POTS patients were healthy and active before they developed long COVID.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But science says it is more than that. Anxiety isn’t just a feeling that’s confined to the mind but rather a condition which can affect the whole body. Unless managed properly, anxiety can even impact long term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/anxiety-disorders" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, anxiety disorders are the world's most common mental disorders, which in 2021, affected 359 million people globally. It is a matter of concern that only 1 in 4 people, suffering from anxiety disorder, receive any treatment. This is partly because of lack of mental health services and partly because many people don’t even know they are suffering from this disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Workplace Anxiety Linked to Rising Health Issues Among Employees&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The hidden physical effects of anxiety&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with anxiety may experience excessive worry or fear, restlessness or difficulty in concentrating. These symptoms may just seem ‘mental’ or ‘emotional’, but they signal that the body’s stress system is working overtime. Chronic anxiety triggers the body's stress response system by keeping cortisol and adrenaline elevated and over time this can affect multiple organ systems contributing to long term health-risks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Cardiovascular health issues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorder is &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5149447/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;linked to&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; increased heart rate, high BP and heightened inflammation.

The county provided the remaining $800,000 needed for the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;News 5 flies a drone over Molly Stark before its demolition — watch it here:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dluiZVhEzh8?si=s0TpueU4iF0_sW2W" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Warning: Offensive language may be found in this drone footage—vandals drew quite a lot on the walls) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 95-year-old Jane Bracht, the demolition marks the end of a chapter that changed her life. In 1964, she was a young mother diagnosed with tuberculosis and quarantined at the sanatorium for six months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can't imagine to be swiped from your house and your child 4.5 years old," Bracht said. "I didn't even get to say goodbye to her and tell her what was happening. It was really a terrible experience for six months." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience had a lasting impact on this retired nurse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any time I go into the hospital, I have a hard time.

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built in 1929, the Molly Stark Sanatorium specialized in treating tuberculosis patients. Thousands received care there until it closed in 1995. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a property auction at the site following its closure, Bracht purchased nightstands that had been used at Molly Stark. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was part of my life for six months and I wanted something from there," Bracht said. "I'd like to get a brick [too]." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stark Parks took over the 40-acre property in 2009, but keeping trespassers out has been an ongoing challenge. The organization installed a $30,000 fence in 2015, but people continued to break in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="Figure" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's been a huge priority," Dan Moeglin, executive director at Stark Parks, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's in the hundreds of thousands of dollars that we've spent in terms of staff time from keeping people from getting themselves hurt," Sarah Buell, Capital Projects and Planning Manager at Stark Parks, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers previously told Stark Parks that restoring or renovating the deteriorating building wouldn't make financial sense. The roof has caved in, wildlife has moved in, and nature has taken its toll on the structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once demolition is complete, Stark Parks plans to convert the grounds into park space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're going to green this space up, reuse the entire grounds as some kind of park activity," Moeglin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[An earlier version of this story said demolition was scheduled to start on Monday. Stark Parks notified News 5 Monday morning and said the contractor is still bringing in equipment today and it will be a day or two before they start the work.]&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reporter's Note: News 5 conducted the majority of these interviews in February 2025.

It touches families everywhere, with more than 10 million people living with it worldwide, according to global estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have been tracing an unexpected lead in the gut. The new evidence points to vitamin B biology shaped by gut bacteria, and it hints at a safe, low cost way to help some patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-parkinson-s-disease-and-b-vitamins"&gt;Parkinson’s disease and B vitamins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study analyzed stool samples from 94 people with Parkinson’s and 73 controls in Japan, then combined results across six countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used metagenomic shotgun sequencing (&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4059276/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MSS&lt;/a&gt;), a method that reads all genetic material in a sample without targeting a single organism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers saw a consistent pattern. Genes in gut bacteria that make riboflavin and biotin were reduced in people with Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change in genes was tied to important chemicals in the gut. People with Parkinson’s had lower levels of short chain fatty acids (&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-024-01014-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SCFAs&lt;/a&gt;) and polyamines, two groups of molecules that support a sturdy intestinal lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nishiwaki-Hiroshi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hiroshi Nishiwaki&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://www.med.nagoya-u.ac.jp/medical_E/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nagoya University&lt;/a&gt; Graduate School of Medicine. His group focused on function, not just which bugs were present, because different bacteria can perform the same jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gut-s-chemistry-ties-to-the-brain"&gt;Gut’s chemistry ties to the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your gut wall is coated with mucus that shields the tissue beneath. SCFAs and polyamines help build and maintain that layer, which keeps harmful stuff out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have found increased intestinal permeability in people with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tiny-holes-in-brain-cells-may-unlock-the-mystery-of-parkinsons/"&gt;Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt;, which means the barrier becomes leaky. When that happens, the nervous system that runs through your intestines faces more stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is where &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3281589/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;α-synuclein&lt;/a&gt; enters the story. This protein can clump in nerve cells, and those clumps are a hallmark of Parkinson’s in movement hubs of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-b-vitamins-and-parkinson-s"&gt;B vitamins and Parkinson’s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riboflavin, also called vitamin B2, and biotin, vitamin B7 &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/micronutrient-deficiency-rates-are-soaring-worldwide/"&gt;act as helpers&lt;/a&gt; for enzymes that shape SCFAs and polyamines in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Supplementation therapy targeting riboflavin and biotin holds promise as a potential therapeutic avenue for alleviating PD symptoms and slowing disease progression,” said Nishiwaki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a small but relevant clinical clue from the past. A 2003 open label &lt;a href="https://www.scielo.br/j/bjmbr/a/BM4WLJBtjxF8Cx3wFsjFhKb/?format=pdf&amp;amp;lang=en"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt; reported that high dose riboflavin, together with eliminating red meat, improved some motor functions in people with Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/proteasomes-in-brain-cells-play-key-role-in-sensing-pain/"&gt;Biotin&lt;/a&gt; has its own resume in inflammation biology. Although its direct testing in Parkinson’s is limited, biotin has shown benefits in other neurological conditions where inflammation is a factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-does-not-mean"&gt;What this does not mean&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This does not prove that taking B vitamins will help every person with Parkinson’s. The biology varies from one person to the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also does not say that specific bacteria are always to blame. Different countries showed different microbes driving the same reduction in vitamin making pathways, which implies the function matters more than the exact species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dosage, timing, and safety still need careful study. Vitamins are not risk free at very high doses, and interactions with medications must be considered by clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the gut barrier thins, more toxins can reach nerve endings in the intestinal wall. That exposure may encourage α-synuclein clumping and feed inflammation over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epidemiological &lt;a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1002839" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has linked certain pesticides, including paraquat and rotenone, with higher Parkinson’s risk. The gut route offers a plausible path for those exposures to matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-next-steps-for-patients-and-doctors"&gt;Next steps for patients and doctors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One practical step is measuring what is actually low. Fecal metabolite testing can check SCFAs and polyamines, and blood work can assess vitamin status when appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targeted supplementation might make sense for people who show clear deficits. That approach tries to restore the chemistry that keeps the mucus layer strong and the gut less leaky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We could perform gut microbiota analysis on patients or conduct fecal metabolite analysis,” said Nishiwaki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-parkinson-s-gut-brain-connection"&gt;Parkinson’s gut-brain connection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vagus nerve connects the intestines and the brain. Signals and molecules flow both ways, and that traffic can influence movement circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Parkinson’s, gut symptoms like constipation often show up years before &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cancer-immunotherapy-drug-also-works-to-slow-progression-of-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;tremors or stiffness&lt;/a&gt;. That timing suggests the disease process may involve the gut early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microbial genes that make riboflavin and biotin are one target. If those are down, the gut may produce fewer of these vitamins even when diet looks fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various SCFAs can be measured in stool samples. Lower levels hint at a community that is not fermenting fiber effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vitamin-b-parkinson-s-future-study"&gt;Vitamin B, Parkinson’s, future study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intestinal mucus layer is not just a coating. It is living infrastructure that keeps microbes at the right distance from the lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCFAs and polyamines help renew that barrier and support the cells that make mucus. When their levels drop, permeability can rise and the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-eating-fungus-beauveria-bassiana-causes-the-immune-system-to-attack-neurons/"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; can overreact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randomized trials will need to test riboflavin and biotin in well defined groups. The best candidates may be those who show low vitamin linked pathways and low SCFAs or polyamines at baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers will also track how supplementation shifts the microbiome, SCFAs, polyamines, and motor and non motor symptoms. If the chemistry and the clinical picture improve together, confidence will grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41531-024-00724-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;npj Parkinson’s Disease&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 19:39:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxPcFlKV2lzQU8yamR1OWM2V3hab1B2VW9odHBZYzFpV0xwcGFCamxsYllyZG1mcXRGTnMyUWVsQmhnLU55ZUt5MVBGbTc2QU5TTFZyQ25JbHFNbjk2SkxtQUkwNDZNSWxOOWM5c3FzM1llOXZiUlAtZVlaZmR5bkEya2NubzBNV1JqcE03ODl6T3ZLVjVQNDZRUlp3Rzl5UERxNS1qWWlMVldIQ0ItY2JwZ2RqY0U</guid></item><item><title>揭示糖尿病失明的隐藏早期迹象-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/diabetes-vision-neurotech-29779/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Scientists have developed a powerful new imaging method that reveals how immune cells in the eye behave long before visible damage occurs in diabetic retinopathy. Using a combination of a head-fixation device, contact lenses, and a custom objective lens, researchers were able to capture live, high-resolution images of microglia activity in diabetic mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that microglia—the retina’s immune sentinels—became hyperactive early in disease progression, suggesting inflammation precedes blood vessel damage. The findings also show that the diabetes drug liraglutide normalizes this overactivity, pointing to new treatment pathways and diagnostic tools for preventing blindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; Microglia become hyperactive before visible vascular damage in diabetic retinopathy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Imaging Tool:&lt;/strong&gt; A custom optical system allows real-time visualization of living retinal cells.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drug Discovery:&lt;/strong&gt; Liraglutide restores normal microglial activity, even without affecting blood sugar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Kobe University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diabetic retinopathy, a form of diabetic eye disease, is one of the leading causes of blindness around the globe. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s understood that vision is lost due to damage to the blood vessels in the retina, but recent research has identified that abnormalities in neurons and immune cells begin prior to vascular damage,” says Kobe University neurophysiologist TACHIBANA Yoshihisa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113238"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an eye." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/diabetic-vision-loss-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;With insights like these becoming possible, the ability to observe the behavior of cells in the living organism directly is of great advantage for developing new treatments. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;He continues: “In particular, microglia, immune cells that reside in the retina and constantly monitor their environment, initiate inflammation when abnormalities occur. But because it is difficult to observe their behavior in living organisms, much of their involvement has remained in the dark.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conventional microscopy setups either require advanced technical expertise to correct the distorted images or don’t achieve high-resolution live images with readily available technology. That’s why Tachibana and his team developed a new technology that combines a head-fixation device, custom-made contact lenses and a special but commercially available objective lens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “This approach allows us clear, long-term observation of the living retina, down to the minute movements of microglia,” the Kobe University researcher says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the journal &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, Tachibana and his team now report that their newly developed method allowed them to identify that microglia start to move more actively in diabetic mice, indicating increased monitoring activity, long before tissue damage is noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This phenomenon has been overlooked in conventional observation in non-living specimens and is an important finding that provides a new perspective for understanding the pathology of diabetic retinopathy,” explains Tachibana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His team also observed the effect of the diabetes drug liraglutide on microglia. They found that in diabetic mice, the heightened activity of microglia was returned to normal, but also that the activity of these cells got reduced in healthy mice, too. In addition, the drug did not alter sugar levels in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tachibana says, “This suggests that liraglutide acts on microglia through a mechanism that directly modulates their behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With insights like these becoming possible, the ability to observe the behavior of cells in the living organism directly is of great advantage for developing new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “We expect this technology to be useful for other retinal diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration, too,” says Tachibana. But the Kobe University researcher also has his sight on another goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says: “Blindness by diabetic eye disease is a serious global challenge. We hope that our technology may be put to practical use in clinical settings as a non-invasive diagnostic method, making the eye a window to spotting systemic disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This research was funded by the Bayer Japan Retina Award, Novartis Japan Co.

&lt;p&gt;Earlier work had hinted at such cells, but Shin and colleagues show systematically that they’re not rare oddballs—they’re a well-defined, functionally important subpopulation. “What we didn’t know is that these neurons drive local pattern completion within primary visual cortex,” says Shin. “We showed that those cells are causally involved in this pattern completion process that we speculate is likely involved in the perceptual process of illusory contours,” adds Adesnik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Behavioral tests still to come&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean the mice “saw” the illusory contours when the neurons were artificially activated. “We didn’t actually measure behavior in this study,” says Adesnik. “It was about the neural representation.” All we can say at this point is that the IC-encoders could induce neural activity patterns that matched what imaging shows during normal perception of illusory contours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s possible that the mice weren’t seeing them,” admits Shin, “because the technique has involved a relatively small number of neurons, for technical limitations. But in the future, one could expand the number of neurons and also introduce behavioral tests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the next frontier, Adesnik says: “What we would do is photo-stimulate these neurons and see if we can generate an animal’s behavioral response even without any stimulus on the screen.” Right now, optogenetics can only drive a small number of neurons, and IC-encoders are relatively rare and scattered. “For now, we have only stimulated a small number of these detectors, mainly because of technical limitations. IC-encoders are a rare population, probably distributed through the layers [of the visual system], but we could imagine an experiment where we recruit three, four, five, maybe even 10 times as many neurons,” he says. “In this case, I think we might be able to start getting behavioral responses. We’d definitely very much like to do this test.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sonoma County’s top health official on Monday issued a mandatory masking requirement for certain health care facilities, a move aimed at curbing the spread of influenza, COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses during the fall and winter months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The masking order, which takes effect Nov. 1, is less restrictive than a similar one issued last year and targets facilities that care for seniors and frail or ailing patients, said Dr. Karen Smith, Sonoma County’s interim health officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affected facilities include skilled nursing homes; certain areas of long-term care facilities where nursing care is provided; acute and non-acute rehabilitation facilities; infusion centers; and dialysis centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-8p60lgsb" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_8p60lgsb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The order applies to all workers and visitors who enter “patient care areas,” regardless of their vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith said public health data shows that these facilities are where transmission of respiratory viruses is most prevalent, and where most outbreaks are taking place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Those are the places where people who are most vulnerable really do need to be protected, either because of their age or they’re immunocompromised, or a combination of those things,” Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added that often these medical facilities “already struggle to stay fully staffed and really can’t afford to have staff going out sick.” Masking, she said, protects both patients and staff.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Sonoma County health officials issued a masking order that included general acute-care hospitals, inpatient psychiatric hospitals, as well as outpatient medical clinics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith said she and other Bay Area health officers consulted with clinical directors across the local health care landscape and determined that such facilities were not now hot spots for transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We decided to give them a strong recommendation to mask, but it’s up to them to decide to what degree and in what spaces,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith said this year’s health order also “narrowed the spaces” where masking is required. Rather than require masking “everywhere patients go,” this year’s mask mandate focuses on areas of the specified facilities where patients and providers interact rather than casually walk past each other.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;“It’s less broad and, I think, more practical, as well as being supported by the data that we do have,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;County health officials said similar health orders requiring medical workers to mask during the winter flu season have been issued since 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith said the “summer surge” of COVID-19 cases, which started a little later than usual, is finally receding. Transmission across the state has been high but is now decreasing to moderate levels, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the order, which remains in effect through March 31, will be re-issued annually, unless rescinded and dates may be adjusted based on viral surveillance data, county officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We still do expect that there will be a winter wave,” she said. “But this is good, because it gives people a chance to get their COVID vaccines before it starts circulating again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, influenza transmission is still low but “it’s bound to rise again.”&lt;/p&gt;

                The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued new recommendations for COVID vaccination that require a consultation with a health professional first.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Monday accepted controversial new guidelines for the updated COVID-19 vaccines that could make it harder for many people to protect themselves this winter compared with previous years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Acting CDC Director Jim O'Neill agreed to the recommendations for the COVID shots from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s handpicked Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which met in September.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Unlike in earlier years, the new guidelines call for people to talk to a doctor, pharmacist or some other health care provider about the risks and benefits of getting vaccinated before they get a shot. This extra step is called "shared decision-making,"or "individual-based decision-making" according to the language in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/cdc-immunization-schedule-adopts-individual-based-decision.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the press release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The move is the final action necessary for implementing the new guidelines, which affect who can get and give the COVID shot, and whether vaccination will be covered by private and government insurance without copayments.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final recommendations were delayed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The step came after an &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/02/nx-s1-5559439/cdc-covid-vaccine-guidelines" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;unusual, unexplained two-week lag&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between when CDC advisers issued the recommendations and the agency accepted them. The official decision &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/02/nx-s1-5559439/cdc-covid-vaccine-guidelines" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;allows the CDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to finally start shipping vaccines to doctors, clinics and other providers through the Vaccines for Children Program, which provides vaccines free to about 40% of all U.S. children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Informed consent is back," O'Neill said in a statement announcing the step. "CDC's 2022 blanket recommendation for perpetual COVID-19 boosters deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination for the individual patient or parent. That changes today."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Independent vaccine experts challenged that claim.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There is no basis to claim that routine recommendations prevent doctors from discussing risks and benefits with patients," said &lt;a href="https://www.uclawsf.edu/people/dorit-reiss/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dorit Reiss&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who studies vaccine policies at the University of California, San Francisco. "Doctors [have always been] required to get informed consent. Shared clinical decision-making simply signals the vaccine is not routinely recommended and decreases uptake."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Others agree O'Neill's claim is false and could undermine public confidence in the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The claim that the past recommendations deterred health care professionals from talking to patients about risks is completely untrue and is another example of the misinformation and made up information that this administration continues to release to the public and further creates confusion and distrust in healthcare providers and vaccines," wrote Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=17154" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tina Tan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in an email. "This is extremely unfortunate and critically increases the American public's risk for serious vaccine preventable diseases."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The CDC also formalized a recommendation that makes it more complicated for some parents to get their babies vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If that's his approach, I am concerned about [additional] childhood vaccines recommended for routine use," Reiss added in an email. "If he thinks a routine recommendation undermines informed consent — which it doesn't — that could further reduce uptake and may make the Trump-Kennedy outbreaks of measles and pertussis we are seeing even larger."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The moves guarantee continued insurance coverage for the COVID shots and allows pharmacists nationwide to keep administering the vaccines. But the changes withdraw some government coverage for the combination shot that protects against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox and that some parents prefer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In previous years, the COVID-19 vaccines have been easily available for free to anyone 6 months and older by simply walking into a pharmacy, doctor's office or clinic and asking for a shot.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Barriers to vaccination&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the vaccines &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/27/nx-s1-5515503/fda-covid-vaccines-restricted" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;became harder&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to get in August, when the Food and Drug Administration approved updated versions of the Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech and Novavax vaccines only for people at increased risk for serious disease because they are age 65 or older or had some other health issue.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The change occurred because top Trump administration health officials say they have concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, even though there is overwhelming evidence the vaccines are very safe and highly effective. Federal health officials also argue that most people have so much immunity now that they don't necessarily need annual boosters anymore.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many public health experts agree that COVID no longer poses the serious risk it once did to many people, especially those who are younger and otherwise healthy. Other countries have also shifted to a more "risk-based" COVID vaccination strategy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But some healthy people still want to get vaccinated to reduce their risk of getting sick at all, missing work or school, developing long COVID or spreading the virus to vulnerable people, such as older family members and friends with other health issues.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Over the past month, the change caused &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/11/nx-s1-5538105/covid-vaccine-shots-pharmacy-fda" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;anger, frustration and confusion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In states like Georgia and Utah, people had to get a prescription to get a shot and some couldn't get vaccinated at all.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The situation was further complicated because Kennedy, who has a long history of criticizing vaccines, said the government was no longer recommending the vaccines for pregnant women and healthy children, even though pregnancy is listed as a risk factor by the CDC and FDA, and COVID can still make some kids very sick.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the vaccine panel, which gives influential advice to the CDC, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5545946/cdc-covid-vaccine-acip-recommendations" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;voted to recommend the shots&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for anyone 6 months and older, provided they consult with a health care provider about the risks and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Confusion still reigns &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The requirement for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/vaccine-recommendations/shared-clinical-decision-making.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;shared clinical decision-making&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; creates a new hurdle to getting vaccinated compared with previous years, by explicitly requiring a conversation with a provider on an individual's risks and benefits before they get one.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new guidelines continue to ensure coverage by private and public insurers, including Medicaid, Medicare, the Vaccines for Children Program and the Children's Health Insurance Program.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The recommendation should also clarify that anyone age 6 months and older is eligible for the COVID vaccine, including healthy children, pregnant women and younger adults. (The only way to protect younger babies, who are among those who face the greatest risk from COVID, is by immunizing their mothers during pregnancy.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But some providers may remain confused or hesitant to administer the shots because of lingering uncertainty and mixed messages, for instance, speculative safety risks presented during the CDC's advisory committee meeting that are not backed by solid evidence.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some states and major medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Infectious Diseases Society of America have issued separate guidelines recommending the shots to most everyone ages 6 months and up, to protect themselves and their communities this upcoming respiratory virus season.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In addition, more doctor's offices may opt against stocking the new vaccines because of concerns the debate may further dampen demand, requiring people to go elsewhere, such as a pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some pharmacies may require patients to read and fill out a form that discusses the potential risks and benefits of the vaccines. But CVS, the nation's largest pharmacy chain, says people will be able to get a COVID vaccines simply by asking for one. Pharmacists won't have to require anything, including even a conversation, unless patients have questions, CVS says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A separate shot for chickenpox is now recommended &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;O'Neill also accepted the panel's vote to ban the MMRV combination shot, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, or chickenpox, for children under 4.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Young children can gain the same protection by getting separate shots for MMR and varicella, and most of them – some 85% – already do, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-09-18-19/policy-recs-mmrv-briefing-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CDC data shared&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and discussed at the advisory committee's September meeting.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's because the combination shot is associated with a slightly higher risk of fevers that can lead to seizures in kids under 4. Because of the risk the CDC has, for more than 15 years, preferred that children under 4 receive the shots separately. Still, some parents were choosing to get the combo shot, because it was easier or more available, and the risk associated with the potentially frightening but temporary side effect is low.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because of the recommendation, the MMRV vaccine will no longer be covered by federal programs that offer subsidized vaccines. "This panel has made a recommendation for a practice that's essentially in place anyway, but removed the option of having those vaccines financed for those who may think this is a better option," says Dr. Katrina Kretsinger, a medical epidemiologist who worked on vaccine policy for more than a decade at CDC, before retiring from the agency in 2023, "This is effectively removing a choice from parents."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Making different policies from the same safety information that was thoroughly examined years ago will also raise mistrust among parents, Kretsinger says. "There is confusion about how to proceed, and also doubts raised by the fact that this is being re-examined," she says, "It furthers the chilling effect on vaccine uptake."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The change may also cause shortages of the separate vaccines, at least initially, until manufacturers can adjust their production to meet the new demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NPR</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 18:04:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxQcTRiWTV3b3Q2b3ExREtEaWk1RlhINVVnZGVWT1lITWRDYUI0RHJFczRpbWZkVWNYeFA2cnVySmhJQzlCdmVuV1FUbURTYjhWcEs2WUVqa2p2aEJyLTFqeUs1NTQ5TVVKdlRRS1lHRm5TeHdhLTlMUzBqMDI1MWE3aDdLQQ</guid></item><item><title>减肥注射：研究表明开始和停止的危险- KSL.com</title><link>https://www.ksl.com/article/51384375/weight-loss-shots-research-indicates-dangers-from-starting-and-stopping</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both starting and stopping this drug can be dangerous. Not only is the research clear about this but Dr. Roberts DC, at &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=weightlossshots-oct25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Heath Utah&lt;/a&gt;, is on the front lines helping prevent and resolve side effects. He reports seeing some of the problems patients are experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such case involved a 16-year-old girl. Roberts says, "She came into my clinic with excruciating pain. She couldn't even drink water without severe abdominal distress. Even though she was on Semaglutide for only a short time, the pain persisted for six months after she stopped injecting it. That's when she came to see me. Fortunately with care, her pain resolved within a few weeks. Incredibly she lost no weight throughout the whole ordeal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some patients aren't so lucky. Their symptoms are more severe or longer lasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: N F/peopleimages.com/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Serious side effects of starting GLP-1 Agonists&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/09/health/report-ozempic-and-other-weight-loss-drugs-linked-to-162-us-deaths/#:~:text=Weight%20loss%20shots%20like%20Ozempic,over%20the%20past%20six%20months" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; in the New York Post, since 2018, a total of 10,000 serious or life-threatening reactions have been reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database (FAERS).  And sadly, medical professionals and manufacturers have reported that these shots were a factor in 162 deaths. The number of these deaths rose by an astonishing 40% over a recent six month period as more and more people started using them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts says, "The reality is that the risk of death while taking these drugs is probably no greater than many other very common drugs. This just underscores the general principle that there are inherent risks in taking any kind of medication."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9192250/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;1997 study&lt;/a&gt; unfortunately found that, more often than not, doctors fail to tell their patients about the risks. So Roberts encourages patients to take on the responsibility of informing themselves, weighing the risks and considering all their options before taking a drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a618008.html#:~:text=Semaglutide%20injection%20may%20increase%20the,swallowing;%20or%20shortness%20of%20breath" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Semaglutide label&lt;/a&gt; lists the following potential side effects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pancreatitis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thyroid tumors, including cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Severe gastrointestinal disease such as stomach paralysis and intestinal blockage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bloating, severe constipation, nausea, and vomiting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acute kidney injury.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hypoglycemia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gallbladder disease including Gallstones and inflammation of the gallbladder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allergic reactions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vision changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rapid or pounding heartbeat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suicidal behavior and ideation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recent studies have found other concerning side effects not listed on the label. The following represent a couple of these studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38937282/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; reported in the journal, Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism, up to 60% of weight lost on Liraglutide is lean muscle mass, which can weaken physical function and slow metabolism. "That means that for every three pounds you lose, almost two of them could be from muscle," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2820255#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2025 population study&lt;/a&gt; reported in JAMA Ophthalmology found there is approximately a threefold increased risk of a sudden vision loss called non-arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/clinical-trials-may-not-differentiate-data-show-women-more-2025a1000lb2?form=fpf" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2025 article&lt;/a&gt; in Medscape reported FAERS analysis found incidences of anosmia, (loss of smell), dysgeusia (altered taste), tinnitus (ringing in the ears), dysphonia (voice changes), hearing disabilities and gastroesophageal reflux disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Kyrylo Ryzhov/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stopping GLP-1 Agonists: Brace for weight regain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're thinking about stopping GLP-1 agonists, be prepared for what's likely to happen. Research published in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism showed that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35441470/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;327 participants in the study&lt;/a&gt; regained two thirds of their weight within a year after discontinuing the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537024000543" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;research published in Sciencedirect&lt;/a&gt; showed that the weight people regain after the shots has a higher fat-to-muscle ratio, leading to a lowered metabolic rate and increased metabolic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anyone coming off these drugs must understand this near-certain outcome if they want to prevent it," Roberts says. "If people coming off the medications will treat the drugs as a jump start to optimal health and weight, rather than the means to it and then take certain steps, they can maintain the weight loss and continue to lose weight if necessary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to maintain weight loss after the shots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first step is to accept the fact that there is no short cut to optimal health and weight," Roberts says. "The laws of health cannot be circumvented with any kind of medication. You may have lost some weight with the shots, but it will all come back with a vengeance unless you adhere to those laws."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second step is to identify any underlying health issues that may be causing your stubborn weight or contributing to conditions that cause it. "Depression, insomnia, hormone imbalances, bad bacteria in the gut, liver/gallbladder problems, insulin resistance, leptin resistance, toxins and deficiencies can all contribute to both weight gain and stubborn weight," Roberts says. &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=weightlossshots-sep25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;At Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;, it is the first order of business to identify these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each patient undergoes a specialized non-invasive body scan. The scan is a functional state assessment of the body which provides an immediate overview of the patient's physiology, stress, fatigue, risk factors, and potential underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to every appointment at Health Utah, patients fill out a proprietary questionnaire that also can identify these underlying problems. The questionnaire is the result of Roberts' 30 years of experience and research. There is almost always a perfect correlation between the results of the scan and the questionnaire. Roberts uses both of these to guide him through a 40-minute consultation and evaluation with each patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third step is to address all underlying health conditions through a customized protocol of care. A care plan can include therapies, supplementation, hypnotherapy, coaching and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final step is to create a customized, healthy and sustainable food plan. Roberts says, "The shots work partially because they reduce the calories you eat. But the shots ultimately fail, like almost every other diet, precisely because they reduce the calories you eat. Calorie reduction never works long term because your body's metabolism slows down when threatened by reduced calories."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Health Utah they don't cut calories, count calories, count macros or points. They don't have you cut out whole categories of food like carbs. They don't tell you to eat all meat or all fat or give you any other faddish diet. They customized your food plan according to your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Take these steps and you will likely be able to maintain the weight you lost while on the shots and get healthier at the same time, something the shots could never do," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Special offer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any health or weight loss journey, it is essential to have the help of family and friends. In a British study, researchers found that both men and women had almost twice as much success losing weight when they did it with a partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=weightlossshots-oct25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; is offering this, their most popular weight loss package, for $59 for two people. You and a friend can get tested, receive a 17-page report, take the proprietary survey and get a consultation with Dr. Roberts. The scan alone is normally $300 for one person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Call (801) 609-3478 or visit &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=weightlossshots-oct25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; today to schedule your appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The opinions and conclusions expressed in this article are the sponsor's own and do not reflect the views or opinions of KSL.com.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's also been suggested it may be because patients who suffer the injury already have undiagnosed dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dementia and MCI &lt;span&gt;are known to raise the risk of suffering from a fall or TBI, which may then speed the advancement of the disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 14million Americans, or one in four, aged 65 years and older, suffer from a fall every year, with up to 60 percent of these resulting in a TBI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, suffered by about 7million people a year, with cases estimated to reach 13million by 2050. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Falls are the most common cause of TBI for older adults, but they can also be caused by car accidents or head trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In milder cases, sufferers may lose consciousness for a few seconds to a minute, have temporary memory or concentration issues, or be dizzy and lose balance again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In moderate to severe injuries, patients may lose consciousness for several minutes to hours, and then experience persistent headaches, confusion, agitation and slurred speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They may also cause personality changes and, at times, lasting disabilities such as memory loss, difficulty with concentration and slower processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is unclear how often TBIs are mild versus moderate or severe, although a World Health Organization review previously found that about 70 to 90 percent of all TBIs were mild in nature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the percentage of participants who developed dementia (Y axis, or vertical axis) by time in years (X axis, or horizontal axis). It shows people who suffered from a traumatic brain injury were more likely to be diagnosed with dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is just the latest study to find a link between a TBI and a higher risk of dementia, after a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13907587/common-injury-increase-dementia-risk-study.html"&gt;2024 paper&lt;/a&gt; showed adults over 65 years old who suffered from a fall were 20 percent more likely to be diagnosed with dementia a year later than their peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the study, published in the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cmaj.ca/content/197/33/E1067#sec-16"&gt;Canadian Medical Association Journal&lt;/a&gt;, researchers analyzed data from health administrative databases in Ontario, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They looked at adults aged 65 years and older who had suffered a traumatic brain injury between April 2004 and March 2020 from any cause and compared them to similar people who had not suffered the head trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were followed until they were diagnosed with dementia, the study's end in March 2021 or had died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to the increased risk of dementia, researchers also found that, overall, about one in three people aged 85 years or older who suffered from a TBI would develop dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the groups analyzed, those who were female and 75 years or older were found to be most at risk of the dementia diagnosis after a TBI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This may be because women live longer than men, and are more likely to suffer from muscle weakness, osteoporosis or dementia, raising the risk of a fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a CDC map showing the states that report the most and least falls among older adults&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study also showed that patients who were older, lived in small communities, and in areas with low income and ethnic diversity were the most likely to be admitted to a nursing home after suffering from a TBI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was not clear why the risk of being diagnosed with dementia after suffering from a TBI dropped slightly after five years, although this may be because the brain has managed to repair the initial damage from the injury, possibly slightly lowering the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Huang added: 'Our findings suggest that, to better align limited health resources with population needs, specialized programs such as community-based dementia prevention programs, and support services should be prioritized for female older adults (over 75 years old) living in smaller communities and low-income and low-diversity areas.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the authors added: 'Although TBI has been studied as a risk factor for dementia in adulthood, our findings emphasize its significant association with an increased rate of incident dementia, even when it is sustained in late life, and how this risk changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is critical information [that] can assist clinicians in guiding older patients and their families to better understand long-term risks.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 17:35:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPY1JBRk1kcVRIa0xQQTJ3dktXcEFzaU1CSUlGYUw0aTBWa3ZWY2RKYlhmRzgzZnU1UFVWeUlLc1BJRS1YZU93ZDJ3bEs0WlpYMkpuX1NvNTUzM09KdjBjLXFVRjlySWt5OE5GeDVYSHhzTEwwZGFVYkpNdGJOTmRNVDBVUGtOT1lDaXFrODRXSEh3VkFlUWI3LUZn0gGfAUFVX3lxTE5pdm5xMUtlS1BJb2FmV0gxdGh6UmFJMHBJVEZ3YVdxQzQ0UDlxb2s1dWZISXpmUDM2QTJFSHNFckFoNFkyVDBaQWFNNUpLZkJPSkxCSV9wbE1SZEtmb1gxNWFrMVJKTU45SFlpRy11ZzJTWV9GSnU2anlNdzRsbEt0d1MtX1J5WVUxcEpqWmFhcUs2dU5yQS16ZXZUcm1MNA</guid></item><item><title>我不知道自己有致命的胃病，被弄得筋疲力尽-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15156831/stomach-pain-bloating-twisting-bowel-cecal-volvulus.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Melissa Gonzalez always had another call to take, a meeting to attend or trip booked in her calendar.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The strategist from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new-jersey/index.html" id="mol-6f6d7790-9fd9-11f0-88b7-b7a95fa3539d"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; was attending a weekend retreat in the fall of 2022 when she noticed an unshakeable sluggishness and that she wasn't quite feeling like herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While at the retreat, she met with a holistic nutritionist who suggested a few diet swaps like cutting out dairy and lowering fat intake. She also urged Gonzalez to see her doctor for a series of blood tests to look for infections or chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But for months, the order for blood work sat on Gonzalez's desk as she continuously promised herself she'd make the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother-of-one, now 48, told Daily Mail: 'For whatever reason, it didn't make my top priorities.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As 2023 wore on, Gonzalez became more and more rundown, moving through her days 'like molasses.' Her stomach also &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15004199/blamed-bloating-bad-diet-diagnosed-cancer-young-people.html"&gt;became increasingly bloated&lt;/a&gt;, and she would go upwards of a week without having a bowel movement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The year drew to a close and Gonzalez promised herself she would start a health challenge on January 10, 2024, with her family and friends to improve her gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when January 10 came, she was on a business trip across the country in Seattle, waking up in the middle night with excruciating abdominal pain: 'It was like I was in full-blown labor.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Melissa Gonzalez (pictured here), a 48-year-old strategist in New Jersey, ignored symptoms of an intestinal blockage for about a year before being rushed to the hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gonzalez was rushed to the hospital, with her husband and eight-year-old daughter nearly 3,000 miles away, and into emergency surgery, where doctors found her intestines had twisted 360 degrees into a knot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About a year after the symptoms started, she was diagnosed with cecal volvulus, a rare type of obstruction that occurs when the cecum, a pouch between the small bowel and colon, detaches from the abdominal wall and twists itself, forming a blockage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The condition can be difficult to diagnosis since its symptoms, including fatigue, trouble passing gas and bloating, mimic more benign, common conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gonzalez said: 'The sluggishness was the biggest thing. I'm a super energetic person. My calm is most people's normal. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I just wasn't myself. It was starting to take so much for me to feel that energetic self.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The condition can go undetected for months or years until &lt;/span&gt;blood flow to the colon gradually gets cut off, causing tissues to die and tears to form in the bowel wall. If the condition progresses, the estimated mortality rate is about 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cecal volvulus only affects about three to seven per 1million people each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with the fatigue and bloating, Gonzalez also noticed her Raynaud's disease, which causes extremities to become white or blue as a response to cold or stress, was flaring up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I've had Raynaud's my whole life, but in that one year, I've never had to layer up so much. I could barely go outside in the winter because I was turning blue all the time, like my hands, my feet, my lips. It was painful.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bowel obstructions can cause widespread inflammatory reactions, which could trigger Raynaud's symptoms. The obstruction may have also constricted blood vessels elsewhere in Gonzalez's body, causing a flare-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time Gonzalez got to the hospital, doctors told her if they waited any longer to operate, the obstruction would have burst and led to septic shock, the most severe stage of sepsis, the body's overreaction to an infection that causes the immune system to attack healthy organs and tissues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gonzalez, pictured here on a New York City ad for Nasdaq, told the Daily Mail that seeing a doctor for her symptoms was not a priority with her busy job and lifestyle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors were able to remove the blockage, but they also had to take a portion out of her colon and reconnect the remaining portion to the rest of her digestive system for it to function properly. Suddenly, always active Gonzalez had to work her way back up to walking across the room and eating most foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'My body basically had to learn how to rework.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors are unsure what exactly may have caused Gonzalez's cecal volvulus, but they suspect for her it was simply a case of bad luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We think it's a one-off, thankfully,' she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some cases, obstructions like cecal volvulus have been tied to low cabin pressure in airplanes. As the plane goes up in the air, the lower pressure inside the cabin can cause gas to get trapped in the GI tract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts writing in the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ispub.com/IJFP/2/2/4144"&gt;Internet Journal of Family Practice&lt;/a&gt; estimate air travel may cause gas to expand up to 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Gonzalez's doctors did not say travel may have caused her obstruction, she was flying frequently at the time, which may have raised her risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infections, pelvic tumors, violent fits of coughing and pregnancy have also been shown to increase the risk. Gonzalez had none of the former three risk factors but does have one daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gonzalez was hospitalized for a week after surgery and stayed in Seattle for another two weeks, as doctors wanted to lower her risk of developing blood clots on the plane, which can occur when sitting still for hours at a time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gonzalez is pictured in the hospital after undergoing emergency surgery for cecal volvulus, a rare type of intestinal blockage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gonzalez is pictured in the hospital with her daughter. She spent a week in the hospital and about three months recovering from the operation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once home three weeks after surgery, Gonzalez's diet consisted of 'the blandest things you could eat,' including white bread and pasta, rice and potatoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dairy, cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and kale, fried foods and even applesauce are more difficult to digest due to high fiber and fat content, and Gonzalez needed low-fiber, low-fat foods to avoid straining her digestive system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even now, she avoids cruciferous vegetables due to fiber and buttery foods high in fat. 'I miss a salad, but I can't do it,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was really trial and error for a few months of what my body could break down, or it would set me totally back if I ate the wrong thing. I would be in terrible pain, cramping up and just kind of keeled over on the sofa until it would pass,' she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also dropped to below 100lbs since she could only eat small amounts of food at a time and is still working to regain the weight she lost. Additionally, she had to relearn how to walk due to the intense pain and the incision in her abdomen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gonzalez will now have to undergo yearly stool tests to look for excess fat in her gut, a sign that the body isn't properly absorbing nutrients, and enzymes that may signal inflammation in the digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gonzalez is pictured after being cleared to fly again after surgery to repair her cecal volvulus. She has since written a book about her experience and those of other women who suffered similar health issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since recovering from cecal volvulus, Gonzalez has taken her experience and written the newly published book &lt;span class="mol-style-italic mol-style-bold"&gt;The Purpose Pivot: How Dynamic Leaders Put Vulnerability and Intuition into Action&lt;/span&gt;, which came out on September 30. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the book, she interviewed other women who had suffered similar health setbacks about their experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website women in the book had a common thread: they were 'hearing' the signs of an issue in their bodies but not actually listening to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gonzalez said: 'There's a difference between hearing your body and listening to it, a very big difference. It seems very obvious, but the fact of the matter is, most of us hear it because our body will tell us, and we don't listen.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Well-being cannot be a side project.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;The Purpose Pivot: How Dynamic Leaders Put Vulnerability and Intuition into Action&lt;/span&gt;, published by Wiley, is now available on Amazon, Barnes &amp;amp; Noble, Target and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 17:32:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNYTRWUFJhVGVBdXZTejhONTdYeVY4QnhZbUMzdEpybXUtQ08zS0FoczZnU0RLN19SYzc3bUExREhXMWZlandnSjNFU1pQamVOeXNxZFRabFRjT0N1UUZKUDNJdFJTbENMajhtM0RYT0RJQWlrR3dzVXA2ZjdTcVRGN1NYQVZtVi1sNG5hUFR3aFNjaWRTYUNvVmtpbHNNczJla2lyZ1ZoZUZkQ0ZN</guid></item><item><title>我身体虚弱，腹胀，但不知道自己正在秘密与致命的胃病作斗争...不要忽视我的警告-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15156831/stomach-pain-bloating-twisting-bowel-cecal-volvulus.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Melissa Gonzalez always had another call to take, a meeting to attend or trip booked in her calendar.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The strategist from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new-jersey/index.html" id="mol-6f6d7790-9fd9-11f0-88b7-b7a95fa3539d"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; was attending a weekend retreat in the fall of 2022 when she noticed an unshakeable sluggishness and that she wasn't quite feeling like herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While at the retreat, she met with a holistic nutritionist who suggested a few diet swaps like cutting out dairy and lowering fat intake.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gonzalez was rushed to the hospital, with her husband and eight-year-old daughter nearly 3,000 miles away, and into emergency surgery, where doctors found her intestines had twisted 360 degrees into a knot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About a year after the symptoms started, she was diagnosed with cecal volvulus, a rare type of obstruction that occurs when the cecum, a pouch between the small bowel and colon, detaches from the abdominal wall and twists itself, forming a blockage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The condition can be difficult to diagnosis since its symptoms, including fatigue, trouble passing gas and bloating, mimic more benign, common conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gonzalez said: 'The sluggishness was the biggest thing.

If the condition progresses, the estimated mortality rate is about 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cecal volvulus only affects about three to seven per 1million people each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with the fatigue and bloating, Gonzalez also noticed her Raynaud's disease, which causes extremities to become white or blue as a response to cold or stress, was flaring up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I've had Raynaud's my whole life, but in that one year, I've never had to layer up so much.

Suddenly, always active Gonzalez had to work her way back up to walking across the room and eating most foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'My body basically had to learn how to rework.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors are unsure what exactly may have caused Gonzalez's cecal volvulus, but they suspect for her it was simply a case of bad luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We think it's a one-off, thankfully,' she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some cases, obstructions like cecal volvulus have been tied to low cabin pressure in airplanes. As the plane goes up in the air, the lower pressure inside the cabin can cause gas to get trapped in the GI tract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts writing in the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ispub.com/IJFP/2/2/4144"&gt;Internet Journal of Family Practice&lt;/a&gt; estimate air travel may cause gas to expand up to 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Gonzalez's doctors did not say travel may have caused her obstruction, she was flying frequently at the time, which may have raised her risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infections, pelvic tumors, violent fits of coughing and pregnancy have also been shown to increase the risk. Gonzalez had none of the former three risk factors but does have one daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gonzalez was hospitalized for a week after surgery and stayed in Seattle for another two weeks, as doctors wanted to lower her risk of developing blood clots on the plane, which can occur when sitting still for hours at a time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gonzalez is pictured in the hospital after undergoing emergency surgery for cecal volvulus, a rare type of intestinal blockage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gonzalez is pictured in the hospital with her daughter. She spent a week in the hospital and about three months recovering from the operation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once home three weeks after surgery, Gonzalez's diet consisted of 'the blandest things you could eat,' including white bread and pasta, rice and potatoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dairy, cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and kale, fried foods and even applesauce are more difficult to digest due to high fiber and fat content, and Gonzalez needed low-fiber, low-fat foods to avoid straining her digestive system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even now, she avoids cruciferous vegetables due to fiber and buttery foods high in fat. 'I miss a salad, but I can't do it,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was really trial and error for a few months of what my body could break down, or it would set me totally back if I ate the wrong thing. I would be in terrible pain, cramping up and just kind of keeled over on the sofa until it would pass,' she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also dropped to below 100lbs since she could only eat small amounts of food at a time and is still working to regain the weight she lost. Additionally, she had to relearn how to walk due to the intense pain and the incision in her abdomen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gonzalez will now have to undergo yearly stool tests to look for excess fat in her gut, a sign that the body isn't properly absorbing nutrients, and enzymes that may signal inflammation in the digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gonzalez is pictured after being cleared to fly again after surgery to repair her cecal volvulus. She has since written a book about her experience and those of other women who suffered similar health issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since recovering from cecal volvulus, Gonzalez has taken her experience and written the newly published book &lt;span class="mol-style-italic mol-style-bold"&gt;The Purpose Pivot: How Dynamic Leaders Put Vulnerability and Intuition into Action&lt;/span&gt;, which came out on September 30. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the book, she interviewed other women who had suffered similar health setbacks about their experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website women in the book had a common thread: they were 'hearing' the signs of an issue in their bodies but not actually listening to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gonzalez said: 'There's a difference between hearing your body and listening to it, a very big difference. It seems very obvious, but the fact of the matter is, most of us hear it because our body will tell us, and we don't listen.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Well-being cannot be a side project.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;The Purpose Pivot: How Dynamic Leaders Put Vulnerability and Intuition into Action&lt;/span&gt;, published by Wiley, is now available on Amazon, Barnes &amp;amp; Noble, Target and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 17:32:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNYTRWUFJhVGVBdXZTejhONTdYeVY4QnhZbUMzdEpybXUtQ08zS0FoczZnU0RLN19SYzc3bUExREhXMWZlandnSjNFU1pQamVOeXNxZFRabFRjT0N1UUZKUDNJdFJTbENMajhtM0RYT0RJQWlrR3dzVXA2ZjdTcVRGN1NYQVZtVi1sNG5hUFR3aFNjaWRTYUNvVmtpbHNNczJla2lyZ1ZoZUZkQ0ZN0gGyAUFVX3lxTE16RUwybVJVaUdtUThRZUZqVHVSemlBX1NmT1pWOEdmWVZwMlBRNFQ5S3ZKVTgzU3pleXRTc01KWWs3X3h6YUVEVTlVQUVMN28tMnhoY2R0WjBHOWl0XzJWZ2FRTjlqaTdHUUxHN2NaSENWXzJ6enJOMWg0TmZPVHlVVEo4TXNGMmV3TU9oSXIxRkJrc093NjZjTG5yZ05CRlZWa3ppODlkbzkzaksxVVRzNVE</guid></item><item><title>布朗大学的研究表明，孩子们的睡眠时间比父母意识到的要少，而且低于他们应该得到的睡眠量--《波士顿环球报》</title><link>https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/10/06/metro/children-sleep-study-brown-university/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content
              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Children between 6 and 12 years old should sleep between nine and 12 hours per night, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Data from the study showed on average, children were got eight hours and 20 minutes, while their parents reported their kids were asleep for more than nine and a half hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“What parents often don’t see is how long it takes for kids to fall asleep or how often they wake up during the night,” Diana S. Grigsby-Toussaint, the study’s senior author and an associate professor at the Brown University School of Public Health, said in a statement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Researchers deployed wrist-worn accelerometers to track bedtimes and other factors, such as how long it took children to fall asleep, how frequently they woke up, and the time they actually spent sleeping, according to Brown. Meanwhile, parents completed surveys and kept daily sleep diaries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, officials said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Children were awake for an average of more than 38 minutes per night, while parents reported under five minutes of nighttime wakefulness for their children,” Brown officials said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The data also found disparities among ethnicities: Fifty six percent of the study participants were Latino, and those children averaged a little more than eight hours of sleep per night while the non-Latino participants averaged eight and a half, officials said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;More than 22 percent of non-Latino participants met sleep guidelines, but only 4.4 percent of Latino participants did, according to researchers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The study also explored whether parents were aware of problems related to sleep. Latino caregivers, for instance, were more likely than other groups to report that sleep was a concern, and to say their child had trouble staying asleep. Meanwhile, non-Latino parents tended to underreport sleep problems,” Brown officials said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Parents in both groups tended to overestimate how much sleep their kids were getting,” they said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Researchers noted cultural factors could have played a role in the findings, as later bedtimes, co-sleeping, and room sharing “are more common in Latino households” and “might influence both sleep behavior and parental perceptions.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Our work indicates that we need to improve our communication about sleep with families to capture the multiple dimensions of it,” Grigsby-Toussaint said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Another factor in play: the wrist devices used in the study have limitations, according to researchers. They “don’t always distinguish between periods of wakeful rest and sleep,” officials said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“This means that the tracking devices, too, could over-estimate children’s sleep volume,” Brown officials said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;To improve their children’s sleep, parents can follow “tried-and-true sleep tips,” including “bedtime routines, maintaining consistent sleep and wake schedules — even on the weekends — encouraging physical activity and exposure to natural light and green spaces during the day, limiting screens close to bedtime, and creating a comfortable sleep environment,” Grigsby-Toussaint said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

When energy demand spikes, neurons even create their own fats by recycling parts of themselves, a process dependent on a key protein called DDHD2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia 54 (HSP54), DDHD2 malfunctions, cutting off this energy source and impairing neuron function. Remarkably, researchers found that providing neurons with special fatty acids restored their energy production and activity within just 48 hours, offering new hope for treating neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fat-Fueled Neurons:&lt;/strong&gt; Neurons can generate and burn their own fats for energy, overturning decades of neuroscience dogma.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein DDHD2:&lt;/strong&gt; Essential for neuron lipid metabolism; its dysfunction causes severe movement and cognitive decline in HSP54.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Breakthrough:&lt;/strong&gt; Fatty acid supplements restored function in damaged neurons, pointing to a potential treatment path.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Helsinki&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists from the University of Queensland (Australia) and the University of Helsinki (Finland) have found that, contrary to what was long believed, neurons don’t just rely on sugar for energy—they can burn fat too. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more fascinating, when energy demands are high, neurons create their own fats by recycling their own cell parts. A key protein called DDHD2 makes this possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113226"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/fat-neural-metabolism-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/fat-neural-metabolism-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/fat-neural-metabolism-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/fat-neural-metabolism-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/fat-neural-metabolism-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/fat-neural-metabolism-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/fat-neural-metabolism-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/fat-neural-metabolism-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a neuron." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/fat-neural-metabolism-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/fat-neural-metabolism-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/fat-neural-metabolism-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/fat-neural-metabolism-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/fat-neural-metabolism-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/fat-neural-metabolism-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/fat-neural-metabolism-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt; “We’ve shown that healthy neurons rely on fats for fuel, and when this pathway fails in conditions like HSP54, it may be possible to repair the damage and reverse the neuropathologies.” Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The discovery that can change patients’ lives &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a brain condition called Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia 54 (HSP54), the DDHD2 protein doesn’t work properly. Without it, neurons can’t make fats for energy and to support their functions, leading to early and worsening problems with firing off their signals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already at a young age, HSP54 patients display progressive defects in moving and thinking. But this discovery brings hope: by giving damaged neurons grown in the laboratory special fatty acid supplements, researchers were able to restore their energy production and function, in just 48 hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a real game-changer,” said Dr Merja Joensuu, who conceived the project and led the study at the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve shown that healthy neurons rely on fats for fuel, and when this pathway fails in conditions like HSP54, it may be possible to repair the damage and reverse the neuropathologies.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New technologies give hope &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team is now moving to the next stage: testing whether these fatty acid-based therapies are safe and effective in pre-clinical models, a necessary step before clinical trials in humans, and whether this fat-fueled brain pathway could help treat other, previously untreatable, brain diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We will continue the exciting collaboration with new non-invasive technologies to image the brain and therefore aid a faster development of the potential therapy.  This breakthrough doesn’t just rewrite the textbooks, it could transform lives” Dr Giuseppe Balistreri from the University of Helsinki says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1759768811101"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What did researchers discover about neuron metabolism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; They found that neurons can burn fat for fuel, not just sugar, and can even produce their own fats during high energy demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1759769303521"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Why is the DDHD2 protein important?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; DDHD2 enables neurons to recycle cellular components to create fats for energy; without it, energy production fails, leading to neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1759769318906"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: How could this discovery impact patients?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; By restoring fat metabolism with fatty acid therapies, scientists may be able to reverse neuron damage in conditions like HSP54 and possibly other brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience, neurology, and metabolism research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a3d3cac28dd3d6d1d1c2e3cbc6cfd0cacdc8ca8dc5ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Pia Purra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://helsinki.fi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Pia Purra – University of Helsinki&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01367-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DDHD2 provides a flux of saturated fatty acids for neuronal energy and function&lt;/a&gt;” by Giuseppe Balistreri. &lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DDHD2 provides a flux of saturated fatty acids for neuronal energy and function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although fatty acids support mitochondrial ATP production in most tissues, neurons are believed to rely exclusively on glucose for energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show that genetic ablation of the triglyceride and phospholipid lipase &lt;em&gt;Ddhd2&lt;/em&gt; impairs mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis in cultured neurons, despite increased glycolysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This defect arises from reduced levels of long-chain saturated free fatty acids, particularly myristic, palmitic and stearic acids, normally released in an activity-dependent manner by Ddhd2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inhibition of mitochondrial fatty acid import in wild-type neurons similarly reduced mitochondrial respiration and ATP production. Saturated fatty acyl-coenzyme A treatment restored mitochondrial energy production in &lt;em&gt;Ddhd2&lt;/em&gt; knockout neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When provided in combination, these activated fatty acyl-CoA supplements also rescued defects in membrane trafficking, synaptic function and protein homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings uncover that neurons perform β-oxidation of endogenous long-chain free fatty acids to meet ATP demands and reveal a potential therapeutic strategy for hereditary spastic paraplegia 54 caused by &lt;em&gt;DDHD2&lt;/em&gt; mutations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 16:56:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE52bmwzanM1WnRUUnU5ejNwMWZYekEwS1JxOGhqZkJyRTNPd1Z4ei13MFVEQXM5N0VJN1VIa2FFeXZ6V0dYczBkSUxvU19rMkNwbE5Jc3NveXRvX3lTOU5uMTlGXzl1VW9Kd2Y3M3JWZlg</guid></item><item><title>美国疾病控制与预防中心宣布更改新冠肺炎疫苗和水痘疫苗建议-《洛杉矶时报》</title><link>https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-10-06/cdc-covid-chickenpox-vaccine-recommendations-change</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-element="story-body" class="ct-rich-text-children font-cms-font-brand-text font-normal text-lg leading-7.75 [&amp;amp;_&amp;gt;p]:text-cms-story-body-color-text clearfix mb-10 md:max-w-170 md:mx-auto" data-subscriber-content&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new acting director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has announced changes to the recommended vaccination schedule for adults against COVID-19 and for kids against chickenpox. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes were expected and were already previewed by recommendations &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-09-19/cdc-committee-votes-on-covid-19"&gt;made&lt;/a&gt; two weeks ago by the CDC’s powerful Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. All members of the committee  were recently replaced after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired everyone on the previous panel earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s changes  have been criticized by mainstream medical groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC is now recommending that children under the age of 4 no longer get a combination vaccine that protects against four diseases: the chickenpox (also known as varicella), measles, mumps and rubella. Instead, the CDC now recommends two separate shots, one just against chickenpox, and the other that protects against measles, mumps and rubella. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC has also now officially lifted its recommendation that adults under age 65 get the updated COVID-19 vaccine. The CDC now says the decision on whether an adult under age 65 gets a COVID-19 vaccine should be based on “individual-based decision-making” in consultation with health professionals like a physician, nurse or pharmacist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This matches a change in recommendations made to the childhood vaccination schedule earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement was made by acting CDC director Jim O’Neill, a top deputy to Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic. O’Neill replaced Susan Monarez, who was fired as CDC director after 29 days on the job. Monarez said she was terminated after she pushed back against an effort by her bosses to undermine vaccines; Kennedy said she was fired because she said she was not trustworthy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Neill has no training in medicine or healthcare and holds bachelor’s and master’s degrees in humanities, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://apnews.com/article/jim-oneill-cdc-kennedy-trump-vaccines-58fd24f678bf46ea6ec96a2b09f85ff4" target="_blank"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;, and is a former investor who has been a critic of health regulations. He has previously worked at the Department of Health and Human Services, serving six years under President George W. Bush. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Neill’s announcement said that the changes will still allow for immunization coverage to continue through programs including  the Vaccines for Children program, Children’s Health Insurance Program, Medicare and Medicaid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Academy for Pediatrics in late September criticized the change, which removed the option for toddlers to get a single shot that can protect against chickenpox, measles, mumps and rubella. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acting CDC director’s statement, issued by the press office of the Department of Health and Human Services, raised concerns about an increased risk of febrile seizure caused by fever after getting the combined chickenpox, measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (known as MMRV) versus those given the chickenpox vaccine separately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics said that in a meeting last month, some of the CDC’s new vaccine advisors “at times...misrepresented data and used talking points common among anti-vaccine groups. Some seemed unfamiliar with febrile seizures. They also disregarded CDC assurances that febrile seizures after MMRV are rare and do not have long-term impacts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends that all adults get the updated COVID-19 vaccine, especially those with risk conditions and people who have never gotten a COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health has slightly different &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Pages/public-health-for-all/publichealthforall.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. The agency recommends that adults younger than 65 with risk factors get the COVID-19 vaccine, as well as all adults who are in close contact with others with risk factors, and everyone who chooses to get vaccinated. The agency also recommends that all seniors get vaccinated against COVID-19. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 16:52:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxPZURMTmpNQnh5ZGp1RFFFUUN5NnMyUGVRd0k0b3ZfQXB4XzFIS1g5T0wtZEs2SmQ1c0h5ZVgzS19kNzh5Y1hzbjJNVlJuUnk5YnVuQ01Gc01nb0hCcTJ6SGtzZ0laMGFUREoxbVB6ZHE4U3NCaFgwbkRUalE4VmRFbi1mQm05SzdEeWRfX0J3dHpRTzJLUzNIUWNDbFc3THp6ZnQ0Rk9R</guid></item><item><title>比以往任何时候都有更多的孩子死于季节性流感- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/more-kids-are-dying-from-seasonal-flu-than-ever-2000668078</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl "&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The seasonal flu is, without a doubt, back, and it’s killing more children than ever. New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that reported child flu deaths reached a record high last winter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CDC experts laid out the sobering data in a paper &lt;a href="https://cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a2.htm"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; late last month. At least 280 children died of the flu during the 2024 to 2025 season—the highest such toll recorded since modern tracking began two decades ago. It’s the second straight winter that pediatric deaths have reached a record peak, which may not bode well for this upcoming flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A modern worst for flu&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The seasonal flu, like many infectious diseases, took a hiatus during the first years of the covid-19 pandemic. The same measures taken to reduce the spread of the pandemic, such as social distancing, also substantially reduced transmission of flu and other garden-variety germs. But as the world returned to normal, so too did diseases like influenza.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Flu cases, hospitalizations, and deaths began to climb back to their usual trends during the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2022-2023.html"&gt;2022 to 2023 season&lt;/a&gt;. But last winter’s flu was one of the worst ever recorded in modern history. It was the first high-severity flu season for age groups &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7434a1.htm#:~:text=CDC%20classified%20the%20U.S.%202024%E2%80%9325%20influenza%20season%20as%20a%20high%2Dseverity%20season%20for%20all%20age%20groups%2C%20making%20it%20the%20first%20such%20season%20since%202017%E2%80%9318"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; since the 2017-2018 season; the cumulative hospitalization rate was the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7434a1.htm"&gt;highest&lt;/a&gt; recorded since the 2010-2011 season; and between 27,000 and 130,000 flu-associated deaths occurred, based on the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html"&gt;preliminary estimates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Since 2004, doctors and hospitals have been obligated to report any child deaths linked to flu to their local health departments; this then allows the CDC to directly track U.S. flu deaths in children for any given season. The 280 pediatric deaths seen last winter are the highest toll recorded in the modern era, and only slightly below the 288 deaths seen during the &lt;span tabindex="0" role="tooltip"&gt;&lt;span class="c5aZPb" tabindex="0" role="button" data-enable-toggle-animation="true" data-extra-container-classes="ZLo7Eb" data-hover-hide-delay="1000" data-hover-open-delay="500" data-send-open-event="true" data-theme="0" data-width="250" data-ved="2ahUKEwijm6q064-QAxX4vokEHXqtN8QQmpgGegQIKhAD"&gt;&lt;span class="JPfdse" data-bubble-link="" data-segment-text="H1N1"&gt;H1N1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; flu pandemic of 2009-2010.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Nearly all these deaths occurred among unvaccinated children (89%), while about half happened in children with no preexisting health conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A sign of things to come?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The strength of this upcoming flu season will depend on many factors, including the inherent severity of the flu strains circulating around the world. But there are already reasons why we should be worried about how hard next winter’s flu will hit children (and adults, for that matter).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;For starters, the flu vaccination coverage was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/index.html#:~:text=As%20of%20April%2026%2C%202025%2C%2049.2%25%20(95%25%20Confidence%20Interval%20%5BCI%5D%2048.2%E2%80%9350.1)%20of%20children%20received%20a%20flu%20vaccination%2C%20lower%20than%20last%20season%20at%20this%20same%20time%20point%20(53.4%25)."&gt;lower&lt;/a&gt; for children last winter than it was the previous flu season. And in fact, the flu vaccination rate in general has been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/coverage-by-season/2023-2024.html"&gt;sliding&lt;/a&gt; compared to before the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The anti-vaccination movement has also reached new heights of power, thanks to the installation of figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the Trump administration. In less than a year’s time, RFK Jr. and his allies have succeeded at &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-vaccine-panel-votes-against-thimerosal-flu-shots-citing-debunked-risks-2000620214"&gt;removing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-handpicked-vaccine-panel-nixes-measles-chickenpox-combo-for-kids-under-4-2000660333"&gt;weakening&lt;/a&gt; several childhood vaccines based on shoddy evidence, and they’ve &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/its-too-much-liquid-trump-rfk-jr-still-gunning-for-vaccines-as-autism-cause-2000662667"&gt;continued to promote&lt;/a&gt; the widely debunked link between vaccines and autism.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Most Americans do still &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/americans-are-already-sick-of-rfk-jr-poll-finds-2000665089"&gt;support vaccines,&lt;/a&gt; generally. And Kennedy has continued to &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/uritheflu/116880"&gt;quietly endorse&lt;/a&gt; the seasonal flu vaccine for children and adults (for now at least). But his &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/06/nx-s1-5493544/rfk-defunding-mrna-vaccine-research"&gt;policy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/moderna-pulls-licensing-submission-combo-flu-covid-vaccine"&gt;changes&lt;/a&gt; and public podium could certainly increase vaccine hesitancy for the flu shot and others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seasonal flu vaccines aren’t 100% effective at preventing infection. But they have and will remain highly effective at preventing the worst outcomes of flu, including severe illness and death. So if children and their families aren’t getting vaccinated against flu, it may not take long to reach another new record high in child flu deaths.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

They might miss a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but they’re not preoccupied by it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"If alcohol is taking up a lot of mental space during this month, it suggests it might have a bigger role in your life than you’ve acknowledged."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;If you're going sober for October but can't stop thinking about alcohol, that's a problem (Getty Stock Photo)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Counting down to the end of Sober October&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;If alcohol is on your mind during a month you're going without it, then another sign might be your thoughts settling on that first drink you'll have after it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Skip ahead to 1 November, your Halloween party is done and dusted, and you're already back on the sauce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The doctor suggested that if you're counting the days until you can drink again, that ought to be a red flag when you could be enjoying October as much as the weather permits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;If you're just counting down the days until you can drink again that's a problem (Getty Stock Photo)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoiding social gatherings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;This is one that several people who've spoken about their negative experiences with alcohol have talked about as an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Speaking to LADbible for Dry January, Jay Motty said &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/lifestyle/dry-january-advice-going-sober-606046-20250131"&gt;it was the 'biggest myth'&lt;/a&gt; that you couldn't socialise without a drink, but there are people who will be ducking out of social gatherings because alcohol will be there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The doc said you should think about why you're not going, and if it's because you think you'll be boring without the booze or you're worried you'll be the only sober person there, then that's another warning sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Jay's advice for Dry January, which also applies to Sober October, is to tell your friends you're not drinking ahead of time so they're on the same page as you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;He added that they might even be relieved if they've spotted your alcohol problem before you've cottoned on, since they won't have to babysit you and can focus on having a good time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;You might find yourself skipping social situations to avoid alcohol (Getty Stock Photo)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A foul mood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;If you're addicted to something and not getting it then your mind is going to be in a terrible state as you suffer through withdrawal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Doc Pemberton said that a functioning alcoholic might use booze to manage stress and wind down after a busy day, and without that routine, you might be in a bad mood for the month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Cutting down on the alcohol will eventually get you &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/one-month-no-alcohol-what-happens-067282-20240813"&gt;in a much better mood&lt;/a&gt;, but the first days and weeks are among the most difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Telling yourself a bit of rule bending is fine is not going to work (Getty Stock Photo)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breaking the rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The rules of Sober October are pretty clear: you don't drink a drop of alcohol all month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, the doctor suggested that if you're breaking those rules, it's a bad sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;He said getting around the alcohol restrictions by telling yourself one drink is fine or that you're at an event where others are drinking so you have to as well, like a wedding, wasn't going to cut the mustard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;You can tell yourself there's a justified reason, but the medical opinion is that it's 'just your brain trying to convince you that you need alcohol'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;It's a good month to take stock and evaluate your relationship with alcohol (Getty Stock Photo)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The desire for a drink&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;If you are an alcoholic and you get through those first hellish days of withdrawal symptoms, then you'll start to see the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/timeline-everything-happens-body-dry-january-822419-20241231"&gt;benefits in body and mind&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;That might sound great, but Dr Pemberton warns that if you start seeing the benefits of going sober but you're still desiring a drink then you ought to dig down into why and think about what it is about alcohol that you want so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;All in all, taking a break for a month is a good way of evaluating your relationship with alcohol, and there are people you can turn to for help if you're having trouble navigating it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please drink responsibly.

The mental rotation task is an indicator of spatial visualization abilities. The paper was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-025-03188-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Archives of Sexual Behavior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental rotation ability refers to how accurately and quickly a person can imagine and judge objects rotated in space. It is an important indicator of spatial ability, a core component of human cognition. High performance means a person can quickly and correctly identify whether objects are the same or different when they are shown from different angles (i.e., rotated), while low performance means slower reaction times or more errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental rotation ability is important for tasks such as map reading, navigation, engineering design, medical imaging, and sports that rely on spatial reasoning. Mental rotation performance has also been used in cognitive training, aptitude testing, and neuroscience research to understand how the brain processes spatial information. Research consistently shows that, on average, males tend to outperform females on mental rotation tasks, especially when large angular rotations are required. These sex differences tend to be moderate to large in size and have been linked to both biological factors (such as hormonal influences) and sociocultural experiences (such as greater exposure to spatially demanding play or training for males).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study authors Karson T. F. Kung and Melissa Hines wanted to investigate whether play behavior in early childhood is associated with mental rotation performance in adolescence. They hypothesized that children with masculine play styles at age 3.5 would have better mental rotation performance as 13-year-old adolescents compared to children with feminine play styles. They also hypothesized that randomly selected “control” children would perform better than children with feminine play styles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These authors analyzed data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). ALSPAC is a longitudinal study in the UK that enrolled over 14,000 mothers and their children. It recruited pregnant women who lived within Avon in Southwest England with expected delivery dates between April 1991 and December 31, 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final analysis was based on data from the children who participated in the follow-up at age 13. This sample consisted of 66 masculine boys and 59 masculine girls, 81 feminine boys and 68 feminine girls, and 55 control boys and 67 control girls. This represents about 60% of the initial group selected for follow-up based on their preschool play behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When these children were 3.5 years old, their parents completed an assessment of their play behavior (the Preschool Activities Inventory), enabling study authors to classify children into masculine, feminine, and control groups. Ten years later, when the participants were 13 years old, they completed the spatial relations subscale of the Primary Mental Abilities Test. This allowed study authors to assess their mental rotation abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results showed that masculine children scored significantly higher on the mental rotation task than did feminine children. This association was not moderated by the child’s sex and held even after the researchers controlled for sociodemographic background, academic performance, and other preschool characteristics such as vocabulary and fine motor skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sex-typical play behavior in the preschool period is related to mental rotation performance 10 years later in adolescence. Preschool sex-typical play behavior may have long-term implications for spatial skills development beyond childhood,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on the links between play behavior in childhood and mental rotation abilities in adolescence. However, although the study is longitudinal, its design does not allow any causal inferences to be derived from the results. While it is possible that early masculine play supports the development of mental rotation abilities, it is also possible that children who initially had better mental rotation abilities prefer masculine play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-025-03188-1"&gt;A 10‑Year Longitudinal Relationship Between Preschool Sex‑Typical Play Behavior at Age 3.5 Years and Mental Rotation Performance in Adolescence at Age 13 Years,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Karson T.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="83" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg9mxwel000gmom7zia3bz95@published"&gt;After complications from a bladder prolapse surgery, a patient named Grace developed a hematoma, or pooling of blood, and she needed pelvic floor physical therapy to help her pelvic muscles relax after holding such a large mass of blood. Without PFPT, Grace’s pelvic pain could get so severe that it was unbearable to sit down, and even after her hematoma disappeared, Grace still got flares: sudden onsets of pain that she says felt “like somebody was literally putting a vise into my vagina.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg9myflv001b3b79z24nvjeg@published"&gt;Even though Grace sometimes rated these flares as high as 9 out of 10 on the pain scale, her insurance company was skeptical about whether her PFPT was medically necessary, constantly demanding reevaluations that forced Grace to temporarily put her treatment on hold. During these breaks, Grace had no way to handle flares aside from making a note to bring them up with a provider later. “I think it took me longer to get better because I had to keep taking breaks,” she says. “I definitely got into very dark places at times. The pain was very triggering.”&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg9myflw001c3b79l54bfb4n@published"&gt;Grace has also been to physical therapy for a torn rotator cuff in her shoulder—a much smoother process. “I don’t even need to get a doctor’s script for my shoulder,” she says, “but trying to get pelvic PT, you’d think I was asking for a new kidney or something.” Because common knowledge about pelvic health is low, with many patients feeling uncomfortable openly discussing this area of the body, the gravity of pelvic issues often goes overlooked. “I think people can understand a torn rotator cuff,” Grace says, “but they can’t necessarily understand pelvic hematoma until they’ve had one.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg9myflx001d3b79x7aq9geh@published"&gt;Pelvic floor therapy is a form of physical therapy focused on the group of muscles and tissues that support the bladder, bowel, and reproductive organs. When these muscles become overly tight or loose, patients can experience issues like pelvic pain, pelvic organ prolapse, sexual dysfunction, and incontinence—which all have serious implications if left untreated. Pelvic floor therapy is used to either strengthen or relax these muscles through techniques including physical exercises, lifestyle modifications, and manual therapy, where the provider applies pressure to the pelvic area.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg9myfly001e3b799yl6symu@published"&gt;For some patients, pelvic floor therapy serves a purpose as fundamental as allowing them to sit in a chair without excruciating pain or leave the house without needing to access a bathroom every 15 minutes. Despite this, Grace’s experience is an extremely common one, since insurance policies that restrict appointment timing and limit the types of covered interventions or diagnoses have forced many pelvic floor therapists in the U.S. to stop accepting health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg9myfly001f3b79tm68pfkt@published"&gt;Pelvic health disorders can affect patients of any gender, but they’re &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/pelvic-floor-issues-arent-just-a-womans-health-condition-kegels-can-work-for-men-too/"&gt;about twice as common in women&lt;/a&gt;, and pelvic floor therapy is often falsely perceived as a women’s health treatment. This means not only that awareness about male pelvic health remains extremely low, but also that pelvic floor therapy is undervalued in a way that’s typical for female-specific treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="136" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg9myfly001g3b79t205l8ce@published"&gt;Insurance policies also fail to take harder-to-quantify aspects of treatment into account when determining coverage, which is particularly problematic when it comes to pelvic floor therapy. Feelings of trust between patients and providers are especially crucial in a specialty like pelvic floor therapy. Because symptoms are located in an intimate area of the body, patients may feel embarrassed or vulnerable talking about them with providers, especially when symptoms stem from past sexual trauma. Patients may also feel distressed about undressing and undergoing manual therapy with a provider they don’t fully trust, which can make it hard to make progress. Plus, patients with pelvic floor issues have often been frequently dismissed by other providers who lack knowledge about their conditions, and they may take longer to trust a new provider after being failed repeatedly in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg9myfm0001h3b79elehc9ip@published"&gt;“Insurance companies don’t pay you to talk to patients. They pay you to do things with patients,” says Michelle Thibeault, a pelvic floor physical therapist in Meriden, Connecticut. Because most insurance policies reimburse providers with a flat per-service rate, which doesn’t increase with longer appointment times, providers like Thibeault have to keep appointments short to cover the costs of keeping their practices running. That means that the crucial conversation it takes to look at a patient holistically, taking individual lifestyle factors into account, is often what gets cut out first.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="129" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg9myfm1001i3b796cqw9qxc@published"&gt;Jessie Klein used to be at an in-network practice before opening Willow Pelvic Health, a private PFPT practice based in New York and New Jersey. Though appointments were 60 minutes long at her former practice, Klein saw two patients per hour, working with one at a time while the other did exercises with an assistant. Because Klein values one-on-one time with patients, she decided not to accept insurance at Willow. “You can think with better clinical rationale and creatively, as opposed to having to just maximize the time you have,” she explains. Klein also recognizes that some in-network providers struggle with burnout because they’re incentivized to see as many patients as possible. “The job is nonstop,” she says. “You sometimes don’t have a break to go to the bathroom.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="131" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg9myfm2001j3b796lekfoqz@published"&gt;Other providers add that insurance companies don’t always cover all of their necessary interventions. Pelvic floor occupational therapist Marlene Handler, for example, says many insurance companies refuse to cover the relaxation techniques she uses to assuage patients’ anxiety, overlooking that patients have to be in the right state of mind before other tactics can be applied. “If you don’t feel safe in your own body, it doesn’t matter what kind of skills I have as a clinician,” Handler says. “Your body will not recover.” Since leaving the insurance model to open the Lifted Lotus, a private pelvic floor therapy office in Brooklyn, she notices that her patients are improving faster—often requiring only about five to seven sessions, while many at her former practice returned for months on end before making progress.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg9myfm2001k3b79yur9qkj0@published"&gt;For some patients, challenges with coverage feed into existing apprehension about undergoing such a vulnerable therapy. “For me, with this kind of pain, there’s an element of always trying to get out of dealing with it,” says one patient who asked to remain anonymous. After being forced to quit PFPT due to the cost, she says, “It felt like I was able to sneakily, but intentionally, ignore the issue.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="58" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg9myfm2001l3b79vt0jcecb@published"&gt;Marlene Berke was first referred to PFPT when she was 21 and found herself unable to have sex. “By unable,” Berke explains, “I mean if I tried, I’d get sharp, stinging, burning pain.” Berke had to wait three months to see a PFPT who took her insurance, which only prolonged her uncertainty about the cause of her pain.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="127" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg9myfm2001m3b79j15vhim0@published"&gt;What Berke didn’t know was that those three months were just the beginning of what’s now been a seven-year ordeal of switching from PT to PT, with each new practice presenting a brand-new set of obstacles. For a while, Berke drove 40 minutes each way to see the closest provider that took her insurance. Later, she gave in and paid hundreds per session to see a private therapist, because her pain was so severe that she could barely walk. “I was so scared that something was seriously damaged or wrong because it was hurting so much,” she explains. Berke has a Ph.D. in computational cognitive science from Yale, and she says trying to get effective treatment was more onerous than the six years of getting her degree.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="111" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg9myfm3001n3b79ks4gntnn@published"&gt;Many providers are fighting to increase access to pelvic floor therapy—for example, Handler says, she uses her position on the board of the New York State Occupational Therapy Association to build awareness about the essential nature of pelvic health care. Still, there’s only so much that can happen without larger-scale changes to the U.S. health insurance system, which fails to recognize the value of treatments requiring high levels of patient-provider interaction. When asked what could make it easier for pelvic floor therapists to work in the insurance network, Klein says, “I don’t even think it’s within reality in our current health care system. I couldn’t even tell you a tangible &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;solution.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It's closely linked to obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-0cd933a0-a059-11f0-8797-d139455908ff"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While many people may be familiar with jaundice (the yellowing of the skin), according to Dr Deshauer, the liver can reveal its distress in unexpected ways, starting at your fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An estimated 80 to 100 million adults in the US may have fatty liver disease and are unaware of it. The liver often remains silent even when diseased (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Your fingernails are constantly growing through a complex, energy-intensive process,' she said in a YouTube video. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Because of that, changes in your overall health often show up there first - and liver disease is no exception.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the first signs Dr Deshauer mentions is Muehrcke's lines on fingernails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'These are horizontal white lines that run across the nails, not on the nail plate itself, but in the tissue underneath. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You can test it yourself: apply pressure to the nail and the lines will temporarily disappear. Since they're in the nail bed, they don't grow out with the nail.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These lines are linked to low levels of albumin, a crucial protein made by the liver that helps keep fluid in your blood vessels, transports hormones and drugs, and maintains pH balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Low albumin can lead to swelling, fatigue, poor healing, and drug buildup, often due to liver disease, kidney problems, or malnutrition. High albumin is rare and usually caused by dehydration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another subtle but important clue is a condition called Terry's nails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Normally, nails have a pinkish hue due to blood vessels under the nail bed,' Dr Deshauer explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But with liver disease, that tissue changes and becomes pale. If the lunula, the half-moon at the base of the nail, is still visible, that's normal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But when the whole nail is ghostly white, I start thinking about liver dysfunction.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like Muehrcke's lines, Terry's nails also reflect low albumin levels seen in liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Deshauer also sounded the alarm about 'nail clubbing'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ask someone to place their nails back-to-back,' she says, demonstrating with her own hands in a YouTube video. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If there's a diamond-shaped gap between the nails, that's normal. If not, and the nails appear bulbous or rounded, that's clubbing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clubbing can be genetic, but when new or unexplained, it often suggests chronic problems involving the heart, lungs, or liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A distended abdomen is another major warning sign of liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People often assume the person is pregnant,' Dr Deshauer says, pointing to an image of a woman with a swollen belly. 'But it's actually ascites, fluid buildup in the abdomen caused by portal hypertension, a result of advanced liver scarring.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Portal hypertension is high blood pressure in the vein that carries blood to the liver, usually caused by liver scarring (cirrhosis), leading to complications like variceal bleeding, fluid buildup, and spleen enlargement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This fluid can total more than 500floz in extreme cases, leading to difficulty breathing and severe discomfort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While liver disease is hard to diagnose, Toronto-based Dr Siobhan Deshauer says there are 12 tell-tale signs that she always looks for in patients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can be treated with a procedure called paracentesis, where doctors drain the fluid with a needle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the more disturbing signs of liver disease is a phenomenon known as 'caput medusae.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a physical sign of portal hypertension impacting the intestines, spleen, pancreas, and liver, which manifests as engorged, snake-like veins radiating from the belly button area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As blood struggles to move through a scarred liver, it finds new routes. Tiny veins under the skin around the belly button start to bulge,' Dr Deshauer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It creates a web-like pattern we call caput medusae, named after the snake-haired figure from Greek mythology.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's not just visible veins that are a problem. Internally, especially in the esophagus, veins called varices can swell up and burst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Deshauer warns that this is one of the most dangerous complications of liver disease because if a swollen, abnormal vein ruptures, it can trigger life-threatening bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A more common symptom of liver disease involves having a red flush on the palms, a condition known as palmar erythema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It shows up over the thenar and hypothenar areas of the palm, but interestingly, it usually spares the center,' says Dr. Deshauer. 'The culprit? High estrogen levels.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Estrogen levels rise in liver disease because the liver can't break the hormone down properly. This can also lead to another telltale sign: spider nevi or tiny bursts of blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is true for both men and women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Spider nevi look like small red dots with tiny blood vessels radiating out,' Dr Deshauer said. 'If you press on them, they disappear - then refill when you release.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While one or two may be normal, three or more suggest elevated estrogen, particularly when the person isn't pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moving back to the hands, if you spot muscle wasting, this could be a cause for concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The liver helps metabolize nutrients and store energy,' Dr Deshauer says. 'When it's failing, the body begins breaking down muscle for fuel.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early muscle wasting in liver disease can be seen as visible thinning or hollowing of the muscles in the hands and temples, with prominent bones and sunken areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another symptom known as Dupuytren's contracture or the Viking grip also impacts the hands when it comes to liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This one is fascinating,' Dr Deshauer said. 'Dupuytren's contracture is when the fascia of the palm thickens and tightens, pulling the fingers inward.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Deshauer suggests trying the 'tabletop test.' This involves laying your palm flat on a surface. If you can't touch the table fully, it may be due to a contracture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The physician also recommends another test to detect liver problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'Your fingernails are constantly growing through a complex, energy-intensive process,' says Dr Deshauer. 'Because of that, changes in your overall health often show up there first - and liver disease is no exception'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'Ask the patient to hold their arms out and extend their wrists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In cases of [a condition known as] hepatic encephalopathy, they'll develop an involuntary flapping tremor - called asterixis.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This neurological sign arises from ammonia buildup in the blood, a toxin that the liver normally clears. In advanced cases, patients may even develop confusion, personality changes, and, in extreme cases, coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the more subtle yet unpleasant ends of the spectrum, however, is bad breath. But it's different than typical morning breath, Dr Deshauer says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's a smell I'll never forget,' she said. 'It's sweet, almost musty, and it comes from toxins like dimethyl sulfide that are exhaled in liver failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We call it fetor hepaticus - literally, 'foul odor of the liver.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bad breath generally occurs in the later stages of liver disease.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The last two symptoms the doctor covers are jaundice and bruising.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Jaundice happens when bilirubin builds up,' Dr. Deshauer explains. 'It turns the skin and eyes yellow, and even darkens urine to a tea color.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bilirubin is a byproduct of red blood cell breakdown, and when the liver can't process it, levels spike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And lastly, in liver disease, the liver stops producing thrombopoietin (TPO), which is the key hormone that signals the bone marrow to make platelets, leading to thrombocytopenia (low platelets). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The liver is also responsible for synthesizing most blood-clotting factors, and its dysfunction leads to a decrease in these factors and impaired blood clotting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These dysfunctions lead to unexplained bruising or excessive bleeding, which are sometimes the first outward signs of something wrong internally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking study set to redefine our understanding of hereditary health and exercise science, researchers from Nanjing University and Nanjing Medical University have unveiled pivotal evidence that paternal exercise can profoundly influence the endurance and metabolic health of offspring. Published in Cell Metabolism, this research elucidates the critical role of sperm microRNAs as mediators of epigenetic inheritance, effectively transmitting the benefits of physical activity across generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise has long been acknowledged as a cornerstone of human survival and thriving, deeply embedded in our evolutionary legacy. Our ancestors depended on sustained physical exertion for hunting, migration, and avoiding predators, which honed physiological capacities linked to endurance and metabolism. However, modern sedentary lifestyles have distanced us from these natural imperatives, raising questions about the long-term consequences on health and inherited traits. This study courageously delves into the molecular underpinnings that may bridge ancestral exercise habits with contemporary genetic and epigenetic inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team comprehensively demonstrated that offspring born to fathers who engaged in rigorous exercise regimes exhibit markedly improved endurance capabilities alongside optimized metabolic profiles, compared to progeny of sedentary fathers. Remarkably, similar benefits were observed in offspring from transgenic mice engineered to overexpress PGC-1α—a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism—in skeletal muscle. These offspring inherited enhanced exercise adaptability and metabolic efficiency despite lacking direct inheritance of the transgene, suggesting an epigenetic rather than genetic mode of inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-1"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle responsive" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1103554060349003" data-ad-slot="3905542493"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fascinatingly, when sperm-derived small RNA populations from exercised fathers were microinjected into normal zygotes, the resultant offspring phenocopied the endurance and metabolic advantages seen in naturally conceived counterparts. This striking evidence implicates sperm microRNAs as crucial vectors of paternal environmental information, capable of altering early embryonic development and setting the stage for long-term physiological adaptations in the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanistic insights revealed that both voluntary exercise and muscle-specific PGC-1α overexpression instigate a remodeling of the sperm microRNA landscape. These microRNAs target and downregulate nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCoR1) within early embryonic stages, thereby lifting repression on PGC-1α activity. This epigenetic reprogramming triggers a cascade of gene expression alterations that bolster mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism in the developing embryo, effectively embedding endurance capacity and metabolic resilience into the offspring’s biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a molecular perspective, this study uncovers a coherent intergenerational regulatory axis comprising paternal PGC-1α expression, sperm microRNA-mediated gene silencing, and embryonic NCoR1 modulation. This axis orchestrates the transmission of exercise-induced phenotypes, introducing a paradigm in which paternal lifestyle factors directly reconfigure offspring physiology without altering DNA sequence. Such an axis not only reshapes our understanding of inheritance but also spotlights sperm microRNAs as potent conveyors of environmental and experiential information across generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the findings broaden the recognized functional repertoire of microRNAs, expanding their role beyond intracellular and intercellular signaling to encompass intergenerational communication. This underscores the concept that sperm RNA cargoes are epigenetically dynamic entities capable of encoding and transmitting complex biological information reflective of paternal physiological states, such as those induced by exercise training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle responsive" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1103554060349003" data-ad-slot="3905542493"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results bear profound implications for public health in a world increasingly plagued by sedentary lifestyles, obesity, and metabolic disorders. By demonstrating that paternal exercise prior to conception significantly improves glucose homeostasis and promotes muscle glucose uptake in progeny, this study offers a promising avenue for breaking the cycle of intergenerational metabolic disease risk through lifestyle interventions. It challenges the conventional focus solely on maternal health during reproduction and highlights paternal behavior as a critical determinant of offspring well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the ability of sperm microRNAs to mediate non-genetic inheritance invites exploration into how other lifestyle factors—diet, stress, environmental exposures—might similarly sculpt offspring phenotypes. This opens a thrilling frontier in epigenetics where the interplay between environment, molecular carriers like microRNAs, and embryonic gene regulation can be decoded to inform precision health strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While further research is necessary to explore the full spectrum of microRNAs involved and their possible interactions with other epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modification, this study lays a robust foundation. It conclusively establishes paternal exercise as an influential factor in shaping offspring metabolic health via a precisely delineated molecular pathway involving PGC-1α, sperm microRNAs, and NCoR1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These revelations may soon influence guidelines recommending preconception paternal lifestyle modifications. By leveraging natural physiological processes, future interventions could amplify health benefits transmitted to subsequent generations in a sustainable, cost-effective manner, heralding a new era of preventive medicine rooted in epigenetic inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, the discovery that sperm microRNAs act as molecular couriers of paternal exercise-induced adaptations revolutionizes our understanding of heredity and health. It illustrates a biological memory encoded not within DNA sequences but within RNA molecules, carrying the legacy of a father’s lifestyle to shape the metabolic destiny of his children. Such insights not only broaden scientific horizons but also inspire a collective reevaluation of how lifestyle choices resonate far beyond individual health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By bridging exercise physiology, molecular biology, and epigenetics, this pioneering work charts an inspirational course toward unlocking the secrets of intergenerational health transmission. It invites us all to consider the far-reaching legacy of our daily habits, emphasizing how the benefits of physical activity transcend the individual, echoing through the lives of future generations in the language of microRNAs.&lt;/p&gt;

This blocks nerve signals from the brain from reaching the muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You wouldn't even know that's happening unless you try to do something, like walk or breathe," Fry said. This effect — characterized by the inability of muscles to contract — is known as limp or flaccid paralysis, and existing antivenoms work well against the symptom. This form of paralysis is triggered by the venoms of three of the four mamba species: the western green, Jameson's mamba, and black mamba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-tAkaagzMncwnvwXNxhfAQK" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-tAkaagzMncwnvwXNxhfAQK slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is a second way that mamba venoms act, which has the opposite effect: it overloads the muscle with nerve signals, thus causing uncontrollable spasms. This is called rigid or spastic paralysis. "Instead of not being able to breathe because their diaphragm is completely limp, [now the patient] can't breathe because their diaphragm is completely contracted," Fry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, scientists believed that the neurotoxins behind rigid paralysis were present only in the fourth species, the eastern green mamba venom. Venoms of the other three mambas were thought to cause only limp paralysis. "What wasn't known is that [rigid paralysis] has always been happening in the background with the other species as well," Fry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fry and colleagues tested how venoms of the four mamba species attack the nervous system, as well as how well three antivenoms commercially available in Africa subdue these effects. They ran these tests using neuromuscular tissue from lab animals, which enabled them to chemically or electrically stimulate a piece of muscle. Introducing eastern green mamba venom caused spasms in the tissue, while venoms of the other mambas triggered no visible response — that is, until they attempted to stimulate the muscle and got no response because the venoms were preventing the muscles from contracting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three antivenoms successfully treated the limp-paralysis effects across all the mamba species, enabling the muscles to contract again. However, at that point, rigid paralysis set in in some cases, and the antivenoms showed poor effectiveness against that. In people bitten by mambas, "spastic paralysis can be fatal but the flaccid paralysis is more dangerous as its typically a more potent effect," Fry noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also noted that the venom of the black mamba — able to kill with just two drops of venom — varied between snakes hailing from Kenya and South Africa. The venoms varied both in how they affected the tissue and how they responded to antivenoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="31c653b3-4ac1-4bbf-bc2a-0c28f5250cab"&gt;"Knowledge on geographical venom variation is needed in order to design antivenoms that contain antibodies against all medically relevant toxins from species, no matter where the species comes from," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/andreas-hougaard-laustsen-kiel" target="_blank" data-url="https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/andreas-hougaard-laustsen-kiel" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Andreas Hougaard Laustsen-Kiel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a biotechnologist at the Technical University of Denmark who wasn't involved with the study, told Live Science in an email. "The significance of the study is that it shows that antivenoms must be optimized to neutralize both toxin types to be effective."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fry next wants to take a more comprehensive and wide-ranging look at the black mamba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'd like to map more precisely which antivenom performs better in a particular region," he said, "which gives the doctors the kind of data that's crucial for evidence-based design of clinical management strategies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="cb8c9ca4-25f8-42a9-abd2-12e7bda5096f"&gt;

But, because walking is relatively steady state—i.e. not too taxing—we’re unlikely to get out of breath unless there’s an added stressor, like going uphill or at a faster pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also a neurological effect. “Our brain and nervous system become more active as we take in and process sensory information from the environment around us and from the movement itself, while at the same time providing stimulatory output to the muscles in a coordinated sequence to help us move fluently,” says Carson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, a &lt;a href="https://aaalab.stanford.edu/assets/papers/2014/Give_your_ideas_some_legs.pdf"&gt;2014 Stanford University study&lt;/a&gt; determined that walking provides a significant boost to creative thinking during and after the activity, with an 81% increase in creativity measured in a divergent thinking test compared to when sitting down. Walking outside promoted the highest levels of creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while all of this is happening, our body is taking nutrients from our muscle, fat and liver tissues in order to convert them into energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How else does walking help?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you’re dragging a petulant dog after you, walking is generally considered a good way to unwind. This is because when we walk at a comfortable pace, our parasympathetic nervous system is activated, triggering a reduction in &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/high-cortisol-levels"&gt;cortisol, the stress hormone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 15:16:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE8yZnBMLTJKMXVXZTFOOHo3TzdHREtWMDFDc0ZSZFF3alRaRlZQYTNFTHVDOHRrNHRPRW5SOGpMZ1Y2U2pUSXRqcHZmVll0MEtBNWV2bmxXMmFVOFBZREMxTHFHeUtIWm9rbmotN0hZZ1Z2dw</guid></item><item><title>可以改变老龄化的尖端医疗方法-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03225-y</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Super Agers: An Evidence-Based Approach to Longevity&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Eric Topol&lt;/i&gt; Simon &amp;amp; Schuster (2025)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;uper Agers&lt;/i&gt;, by clinician Eric Topol, has just been published, but it was almost surreal for me as a US scientist to read the book now, with its optimistic take on the state of the medical field.

He explains each disease and the current state of treatments — including an impressive overview of ongoing and recently completed clinical trials — and explores future possibilities. These include advances in CRISPR gene editing and stem-cell techniques aimed at treating blood disorders, cancers, Alzheimer’s disease and more. He covers an immense amount of material in an accessible manner, and has well-supported recommendations for readers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the diseases covered — obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, for example — might not be considered ‘ageing’ by non-specialists. But Topol, like most researchers in the field, argues that anything that decreases life expectancy and quality of life is a facet of ageing, and should be addressed medically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many popular-science books about ageing and longevity focus on either personal stories or self-help suggestions. By contrast, this book is light on anecdote. Topol — a trained cardiologist at Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California, who has been interested in human ageing for several decades — uses his own clinical experience to describe the progress and outstanding challenges in a range of health issues. Given this background, it is no surprise that the author focuses on chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Topol is particularly bullish on GLP-1 agonists: the blockbuster diabetes and obesity drugs, such as semaglutide (sold as Ozempic), that have shown benefits for not just these diseases, but also a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03074-1" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03074-1" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;surprising set of healthspan-shortening condition&lt;/a&gt;s. Calling them “one of the most life-changing medicines in history”, he explains that GLP-1 agonists have positive effects on liver disease, kidney disease, cancer and fertility. Some hope that the drugs might help to treat dementia, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lifestyle factors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also touches on a few facets of human ageing that are less easily studied in animal models, namely the importance of outlook, social interactions and the impact of mental health. Topol points out that the “wellderly” population (people who are more than 80 years old and very healthy) have little in common at the genetic level, but are very active and socially engaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02677-y" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03225-y/d41586-025-03225-y_27488558.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Forever young: what science can and can’t tell us about cheating ageing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author offers two examples — Mrs L. R., a 98-year-old ‘healthy ager’, and Mr R.P., who is also 98 but has greatly benefited from advances in medicine — to illustrate his larger messages about the value of human interactions and medical progress. Longer lives might be achieved either through random good luck, resiliency and a sunny disposition (as with Mrs L. R.) or through current state-of-the-art medical treatments (Mr R.P.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with any work on lifespan and healthspan, Topol’s book summarizes current knowledge about the impact of diet, but he notes the lack of true randomized clinical trials exploring how diet affects longevity. He offers some advice that counters messages from other longevity gurus — pointing out, for example, that the high protein intake that others have recommended, with little solid evidence, might be associated with inflammation. Otherwise, the information is consistent with much of what can be found elsewhere, just with solid clinical support. And of course, exercise is covered, too. For example, he notes that, with his own growing awareness of research on exercise and ageing, his advice to patients as a cardiologist has shifted from emphasizing aerobic conditioning, instead highlighting the importance of strength, resistance and balance training to reduce the risk of age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03225-y/d41586-025-03225-y_51509134.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03225-y/d41586-025-03225-y_51509134.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="A doctor holdings the leg of an elderly patient sitting on bed in a rural hospital in China" loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03225-y/d41586-025-03225-y_51509134.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Although some people are naturally healthy agers, others rely on medical treatments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: CFOTO/Future Publishing/Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Topol notes with some frustration that diagnostic tests that could accelerate treatments have often not been adopted broadly. For instance, a clear point of exasperation is that metagenomics — an approach to rapidly uncover the source of an infection — is not used widely. Although some procedures that might diagnose, cure or treat diseases have not become normal in clinical practice owing to high costs, others might simply require changes to standards and training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It may be 'more reasonable to interpret restless legs syndrome as a potential risk factor for developing Parkinson's disease, rather than an early manifestation,' they added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Parkinson's disease occurs when brain cells called dopaminergic neurons progressively break down, leading to a deficiency of dopamine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This dopamine deficit impairs communication between brain cells, causing the  symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as tremors, slowed movement, and balance problems, because dopamine is essential for fine-tuning muscle control. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, the scientists from Korea University Ansan Hospital, tracked 19,838 patients, half of which had been &lt;span&gt;diagnosed with restless legs syndrome.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over a follow-up of 15 years on average, 1.6 per cent of those with the syndrome developed Parkinson's, compared to just one per cent without. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among those with restless leg syndrome, 0.5 per cent of patients taking dopamine agonists developed Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By contrast, 2.1 per cent of those not on medication were diagnosed with the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dopamine agonists are commonly prescribed not only for Parkinson's disease but also for moderate to severe restless legs syndrome, because dopamine is thought to play a role in both conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Symptoms can include uncontrollable tremors, slow movements and muscle stiffness, but experts say they often only appear when about 80 per cent of the nerve cells have been lost&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The dopamine agonist-treated group tended to be at decreased risk of developing Parkinson's disease, whereas the dopamine agonist-nontreated group tended to be at increased risk,' the researchers said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This suggests that the association between restless legs syndrome and Parkinson's disease might not be due to the dopaminergic pathway, but rather a different mechanism.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, it could involve another underlying process—such as inflammation or changes in how the brain's sensory systems work—that increases the risk of both, they suggested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it was vital further research was done to prove the findings, they added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also cautioned that the findings should be interpreted carefully, as the diagnoses were based on clinical judgement rather than laboratory tests, which could have led to some cases being missed or misclassified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For example, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, a well-known early feature of Parkinson's disease, may have been misdiagnosed as restless legs syndrome in some cases,' they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK around 166,000 people are living with Parkinson's, a figure that is worryingly expected to double by 2050. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While not directly fatal, the disease leaves sufferers more vulnerable to life-threatening infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Back to the Future film star, Michael J Fox, was diagnosed with Parkinson's at just 29, in 1991&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Famous figures who have battled the disease include actor Michael J. Fox, who was diagnosed in 1991 at just 29, and went public seven years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since then, the Back to the Future star has become the leading campaigner for research, founding The Michael J. Fox Foundation, which has raised billions to find a cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rock legend Ozzy Osbourne revealed in 2020 that he had been diagnosed the year before, describing the toll it has taken on both his body and mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Black Sabbath frontman, who died in July, spoke candidly about the 'never-ending' struggle with the disease and how it has forced him to scale back performing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Earlier this year, Health Secretary Robert F. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-guts-acip-cdc-vaccine-panel-rcna211935" target="_blank"&gt;Kennedy Jr. fired all 17 members&lt;/a&gt; of the influential vaccine panel, replacing them with his own picks, many of whom have spoken out against Covid vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5c18cb" class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy, a long-time anti-vaccine activist who has falsely&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;called the Covid vaccine the “deadliest vaccine ever made,” first &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-wants-limit-cdcs-role-infectious-diseases-rcna228543" target="_blank"&gt;moved to limit access to shots&lt;/a&gt; in May, when he bypassed the typical regulatory process and announced the CDC would no longer recommend Covid vaccines to healthy children and pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-391b91" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC’s sign-off on Monday does not mean people younger than 65 are barred from getting a Covid vaccine — they still can do so, after consulting with a doctor or pharmacist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b0b293" class="body-graf"&gt;Adding in this so-called shared clinical decision-making essentially “puts up one more little barrier” to getting the shot, said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a professor of global health and infectious diseases at Stanford University. “It’s kind of a vague term that says you should have your doctor or your provider or pharmacist tell you what the risks and benefits are before you get the vaccine.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-838119" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC said that the vaccine panel's recommendations for people under 65 found the most benefit for someone at  increased risk for severe Covid due to underlying conditions. The benefit of vaccination was lowest for people under 65 who aren't at increased risk for severe Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b397c5" class="body-graf"&gt;But how easy it is to get a Covid shot may depend on where you live. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b07538" class="body-graf"&gt;In previous years, states have generally mirrored the CDC’s vaccine guidance, particularly that of the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/covid-vaccine-eligibility-limit-over-65-health-conditions-cdc-rcna232374" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine advisory panel, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, ACIP&lt;/a&gt;, which had been considered one of the foremost authorities on vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-737bdb" class="body-graf"&gt;Prior to the CDC’s announcement, 26 states (mostly blue states with Democratic governors) had already set their own Covid shot guidance to keep access as broad as possible, according to &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/covid-19/tracking-state-actions-on-vaccine-policy-and-access/" target="_blank"&gt;KFF&lt;/a&gt;, a nonpartisan health policy research group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ca1e8d" class="body-graf"&gt;The result is a complex hodgepodge of Covid vaccine policies nationwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6d6a91" class="body-graf"&gt;“We now have had a breakdown in consensus between the federal government and the states as to how to manage Covid immunization,” said Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the Precision Vaccines Program at Boston Children’s Hospital. “We are facing an unprecedentedly complicated landscape.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-467879" class="body-graf"&gt;Illinois, Maryland and Washington, D.C., for example, officially recommend universal Covid vaccination for everyone 6 months and older. Other states, like California, Michigan and Minnesota, recommend the shots for everyone 3 years and older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5f973e" class="body-graf"&gt;“Viruses don’t respect state borders,” Levy said. “From the perspective of protecting the public against infectious diseases, the last thing you would want as a strategy is to protect different states differently. It’s confusing, it’s inconsistent, and it leaves certain people vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-18ea36" class="body-graf"&gt;What’s more, some doctors’ offices might not have any incentive to stock the vaccine since the CDC’s recommendation focuses on older adults. Last season, 23% of adults and 13% of children got the Covid vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covidvaxview/weekly-dashboard/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-888eb6" class="body-graf"&gt;“There’s all kinds of ways where people who want the vaccine might not be able to get it because of all of these little obstacles that are put in place, even though, in theory, anybody 6 months and older should be able to get them,” said Maldonado, who is also a pediatrician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b2d6ac" class="body-graf"&gt;In a statement, Amy Thibault, a spokesperson for CVS Health, said its pharmacies would be ready to administer Covid shots for people ages 5 and older as soon as the CDC signed off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aa63bd" class="body-graf"&gt;Walgreens starts Covid vaccines at age 3. A spokesperson for Walgreens said in an email that the pharmacy chain “will offer the 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccines at locations nationwide” without a prescription. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-fed0a5" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I need a Covid shot?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b3e482" class="body-graf"&gt;While a summer uptick in cases appears to have peaked in most areas of the country, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/surveillance/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC surveillance&lt;/a&gt;, every year since the Covid pandemic started in 2020 has also had a winter wave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c3264b" class="body-graf"&gt;Like the flu shot, the Covid vaccine doesn't necessarily stop a person from getting infected with the virus. But it does reduce the chances of severe illness, hospitalization or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5b3e3d" class="body-graf"&gt;Pfizer and Moderna’s updated Covid shots target the LP.8.1 variant, which was the dominant strain in the U.S. earlier this year but has been&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/variants/variants-and-genomic-surveillance.html" target="_blank"&gt; overtaken by newer variants&lt;/a&gt;. Novavax’s updated Covid shot targets an even older strain, called JN.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1838f1" class="body-graf"&gt;As of Sept. 27, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/variants/variants-and-genomic-surveillance.html" target="_blank"&gt;LP.8.1 accounts for just 3%&lt;/a&gt; of all new Covid cases, according to the CDC. A strain called XFG is now dominant, accounting for at least 85% of new Covid cases. All are descendants of the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/omicron-symptoms-covid-what-to-know-rcna9469" target="_blank"&gt;omicron variant&lt;/a&gt;, which emerged in late 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-faf171" class="body-graf"&gt;Research presented by Moderna and Pfizer at an &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/186595/download" target="_blank"&gt;FDA advisory committee meeting in May&lt;/a&gt; found that the updated shot generated a modestly stronger immune response to the strains circulating at that time than last year’s Covid shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c3a43d" class="body-graf"&gt;It typically takes a few weeks after the Covid vaccine for immunity to build. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-99f37a" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the Covid shot free?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a548f8" class="body-graf"&gt;Most people with insurance who want a Covid vaccine should be able to get it free this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-347ae6" class="body-graf"&gt;Ahead of the CDC’s advisory committee meeting, &lt;a href="https://www.ahip.org/news/press-releases/ahip-statement-on-vaccine-coverage" target="_blank"&gt;AHIP&lt;/a&gt;, a health insurance industry trade group, said that private plans will continue to cover all CDC-recommended vaccines that were recommended as of Sept. 1, meaning its previous Covid shot recommendation for everyone 6 months and older still applies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-449a61" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Medicare, Medicaid and other government health programs will continue to cover the shots at no cost, according to an HHS spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 14:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxQWGRkbGZvRXY5WlFXTFo2OW81eDZmQWhIVVFtU3ZoUHdHMTFiTFNoNmhDTlJPNzZzTkpZZGNoOGY3WkpyQU44Y29DRk94WmxwX2wzTC1RaWJaMDZVVy04ZkJCZzlnOFpib3V5SWZSVndMd3BBaktGTkEtNElyanFadnpHd2dhUDl3cXpRUG53M1BEamhkREFCeGplV0ZKTl9LUG53SjhveEF3aV9aOXh2cmt0bGd3YVXSAVZBVV95cUxOcUhlQ2dYZmhRSUxqX1BZNGxta3NBYWNURGFiYVBBcnhlZWh1dkhtWUFJb0Z1ZVFubVE0V0loM0ozYjByZWY4dFowdUNRU0pxNzdDR05NQQ</guid></item><item><title>冷水浸泡可能会带来健康益处-也会带来风险-美联社新闻</title><link>https://apnews.com/article/cold-water-immersion-swimming-health-benefits-2e27abe6e8138b6eabd5b6185e1a3d41</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="LeaderBoardAd-Mobile "&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;Dr. Mark Harper recalls his first &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/china-harbin-winter-swimming-fc26b27d86b03c29c88f20d0b28496c7"&gt;cold-water swim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the south of England 20 years ago. It was August, but the initial jolt from the plunge took his breath away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shock to his system lasted a minute or two until he was “recombobulated and able to think about something other than the cold,” Harper says. A surprise sensation soon replaced his discomfort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I remember getting out of the water the first time and feeling so good,” Harper, an anesthesiologist who has since researched the potential risks and rewards of &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/winter-swimming-memphremagog-vermont-0ff8bcc2b2e1b8f1d306bbc0efa3acce"&gt;taking a nippy dunk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. “I wasn’t expecting that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claims about the benefits of &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/czech-record-polar-bear-dip-3015c17bf2efad8567a9bfeb35efb2aa"&gt;cold-water immersion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; date back centuries. Thomas Jefferson, the principal author of the Declaration of Independence and the third American president, wrote toward the end of his life about using a cold foot bath daily for 60 years. He also owned a book published in 1706 on the history of cold-water bathing. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;While evidence is building around the positive health effects of swimming in chilly water, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/health-8d7e4523e0587837ce9ec8c1befce649"&gt;bathing in ice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or taking cold showers, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/health-8d7e4523e0587837ce9ec8c1befce649"&gt;scientific confirmation is still lacking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Harper, who became a regular &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/open-water-swimming-251117808a4d7b29e6642f1c803cc5ab"&gt;cold-water swimmer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; after his initiation, said there are strong signs that people can derive mental health benefits from the activity. He mentioned a positive effect on depression and general well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For now, we have a very strong base, but not hard evidence, that cold-water immersion is effective for mental health,” Harper told The Associated Press. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Boosting mental health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harper said his own early experiences with cold-water swimming piqued his professional curiosity. As a physician, he wondered if the brief bodily shock had clinical uses for treating depression. He cited the biological phenomenon of hormesis, in which a stressor introduced at a low dose creates a positive response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muscles and bones put under stress —for example, with weight-bearing exercise — also respond and grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harper acknowledged that the positive effects he’s observed may be the result of the placebo effect, a phenomenon in which people who are given a medicine they think will help them report responding to the treatment even if it had no active ingredients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of cold-water immersion, the benefits may come from meeting people, the exercise itself, or simply accepting a challenge and accomplishing it, which improves self-confidence, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Personally, I think it’s all of those things, and the cold has an additive effect,” Harper said. “I think we have a good physiological basis for that. The basic science tells us the cold has a very strong effect on the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we’re talking about is an intervention, when it’s used clinically, that produces beneficial effects on mental health. So in a way it doesn’t matter which aspect is generating the positive effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harper cited what he said was a common reaction among first-timers who have taken the plunge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They often say “the fact that I’ve done this means I can do anything,” he said. “It’s quite a confidence builder and it’s something people stick to because they enjoy it so much.” &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Know the risks when you start&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mike Tipton, a physiologist at the University of Portsmouth in England who has studied extreme environments, authored a paper along with Harper and two more researchers several years ago. The title highlighted the potential advantages and dangers of stimulating the body with a sudden drop in temperature: “Cold Water Immersion: Kill or Cure.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Like other environmental constituents such as pressure, heat and oxygen, cold water can be either good or bad, threat or treatment depending on circumstance,” they wrote after reviewing the research then available on the topic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of their findings: The activity presents dangers. Deaths from cold-water immersion are not uncommon. The shock of frigid water can cause people to hyperventilate and drown. But Tipton told The AP the risks can be managed with common sense and precautions.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;How cold, how long?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You do not need to go to extremes to get a potential payoff. Entering water at a temperature of 20-15 degrees Celsius (68-59F) and staying for only a few minutes is sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tipton explained if the water is colder than that, you may get more benefit — but limit your exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you ask me what protocol you would follow if you thought this was going to be doing you good, I wouldn’t go in water much below 12C (54F), and I wouldn’t stay in for much more than two minutes,” Tipton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tipton and Harper both said that any benefits from cold-water immersion come from the body’s cold-shock response: the sudden fall of skin temperature, the release of the stress hormones, the release of endorphins, and the anti-inflammatory effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tipton cautioned against long spells in an ice bath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sitting in water for as long as I can fills me with horror,” Tipton said. “This could destroy small nerves, blood vessels in extremities and could result in amputation the same way frostbite can.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Harper, who has swum as long as four-hour stretches in open water, advised vigilance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People think it’s got to be super cold, super long and the longer the better,” Harper said, “and that’s wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Be safe. You’re a tropical animal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tipton said he’s not trying to be the “fun police” but suggested caution and a medical screening if you take the plunge. He said humans are considered “tropical animals” who need to adapt to the cold and are better suited to warm conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A human’s resting body temperature is about 36.5 to 37.5 degrees Celsius (97.7 to 99.5F). Because of that, cold-water immersion is stressful and carries risks for the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Not to mention the risk of drowning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t want to stop people doing it, but we want to make sure they do it in a way that maximizes the benefits and minimizes the risks,” Tipton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He suggested swimming in a life-guarded area, or going with experienced outdoor swimmers. He also suggested knowing the body of water you’re swimming in. Hazards, among others, include tides, temperature, depth and pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understand that taking a tropical animal and putting it in cold water is probably the greatest stress that most people will experience in their life,” Tipton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He suggested entering the water in a controlled fashion instead of jumping in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Be sensible about it,” he said. “Incremental is the key.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, small grooves on ancient human teeth were thought to be evidence of deliberate tool use—people cleaning their teeth with sticks or fibers, or easing gum pain with makeshift "toothpicks." Some researchers even &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhevol.2020.102769" target="_blank"&gt;called it the oldest human habit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;But our new findings, published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ajpa.70132" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;American Journal of Biological Anthropology&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, challenge this long-held idea about &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/human+evolution/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human evolution&lt;/a&gt;. We found these grooves also appear naturally in wild &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/primates/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;primates&lt;/a&gt;, with little support for tooth-picking as the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more striking, in more than 500 wild primates, across 27 species both living and fossil, we found no trace of a common modern dental disease: deep, V-shaped gumline notches called abfraction lesions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings can help reshape how we interpret the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/fossil+record/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;fossil record&lt;/a&gt; and raise fresh questions about the uniquely human ways our teeth are affected today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why teeth matter in human evolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teeth are the most durable part of the skeleton and often survive long after the rest of the body has decayed. Anthropologists rely on them to reconstruct ancient diets, lifestyles and health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even tiny marks can carry important meaning. One recurring feature is the thin groove across exposed tooth roots, especially between teeth. &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27907646" target="_blank"&gt;Since the early 20th century&lt;/a&gt;, these have been labeled "toothpick grooves" and interpreted as signs of tool use or &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/dental+hygiene/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dental hygiene&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have been reported across our recent &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/evolutionary+history/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;evolutionary history&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0003-9969(00)00128-X" target="_blank"&gt;from 2-million-year-old fossils through to Neanderthals&lt;/a&gt;. But until now, no one had really checked whether other primates also have them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A different condition, abfraction, looks very different—deep wedge-shaped notches near the gumline. These are very common in modern dentistry and often linked to tooth grinding, forceful brushing, or acidic drinks. Their absence in the fossil record has long puzzled researchers. Do other primates really never suffer from them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;What we did&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test these assumptions, we analyzed more than 500 teeth from 27 &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/primate+species/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;primate species&lt;/a&gt;, both extinct and living. The sample included gorillas, orangutans, macaques, colobus monkeys, fossil apes and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, all specimens came from &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/wild+populations/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;wild populations&lt;/a&gt;, meaning their tooth wear could not have been influenced by toothbrushes, soft drinks or processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We looked for non-carious cervical lesions—a name for tissue loss at the tooth neck not caused by decay. Using microscopes, 3D scans and tissue-loss measurements, we documented even the smallest lesions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What we found&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 4% of individuals had lesions. Some looked almost identical to the classic "toothpick grooves" of fossil humans, complete with fine parallel scratches and tapering shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others were shallow and smooth, especially on front teeth, likely caused by acidic fruits that many primates consume in large amounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one absence stood out. We found no abfraction lesions at all. Despite studying species with extremely tough diets and powerful chewing forces, not a single primate showed the wedge-shaped defects so &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2147/CCIDE.S63465" target="_blank"&gt;commonly seen in modern dental clinics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;What does this mean?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, grooves that resemble "toothpick" marks don't necessarily prove tool use. Natural chewing, abrasive foods, or even swallowed grit can produce similar patterns. In some cases, specialized behaviors like stripping vegetation with the teeth may also contribute. We therefore need to be cautious about interpreting every fossil groove as deliberate toothpicking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the complete absence of abfraction lesions in primates strongly suggests these are a uniquely human problem, tied to modern habits. They are far more likely caused by forceful brushing, acidic drinks and processed diets than by natural chewing forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This places abfraction alongside other dental issues, such as impacted wisdom teeth and misaligned teeth, which are rare in wild primates but common in humans today. Together, these insights are shaping a growing subfield known as evolutionary dentistry, using our evolutionary past to understand the dental problems of the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why it matters today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, grooves on fossil teeth may sound trivial. But they matter for both anthropology and dentistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For evolutionary science, they show why we must check our closest relatives before assuming a specific, or unique, cultural explanation. For modern health, they highlight how profoundly our diets and lifestyles alter our teeth in ways that set us apart from other primates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparing human teeth with those of other primates, we can tease apart what's universal (the inevitable wear and tear of chewing) and what's uniquely human—the result of modern diets, behaviors and dental care.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research will expand to larger primate samples, investigate diet-wear links in the wild, and apply advanced imaging to see how lesions form. The aim is to refine how we interpret the past while finding new ways on how to prevent dental disease today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What may look like a fossil human tooth-picking groove could just as easily be the by-product of everyday chewing. Equally, it might reflect other cultural or dietary behaviors that leave similar marks. To untangle these possibilities, we need much larger comparative datasets of lesions in wild primates, only then can we begin to trace broader patterns and refine our interpretations of the fossil record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the absence of abfraction lesions in primates suggests that some of our most common dental problems are uniquely human. It's a reminder that even in something as everyday as toothache, our evolutionary history is written in our teeth, but shaped as much by modern habits as by ancient biology.&lt;/p&gt;

While it primarily affects the liver, research shows it also has significant effects on overall health, particularly the heart. Individuals with fatty liver are at higher risk of developing cardiovascular problems such as atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and heart failure. Factors like chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, and altered lipid metabolism link liver fat accumulation to heart health. Fatty liver disease can progress silently over years, often without obvious symptoms, but may lead to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and increased mortality if left unmanaged. Early detection, lifestyle changes, and medical management are essential to reduce risks and protect both liver and cardiovascular function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding fatty liver disease and its link with heart disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty liver disease occurs when excess fat accumulates in liver cells. In MASLD, this condition arises in individuals without significant alcohol consumption, often linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. The disease progresses through stages:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;7 Ways to check for fatty liver at home&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simple steatosis: Fat accumulation without inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH): Fat accumulation accompanied by inflammation and liver cell damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cirrhosis: Severe scarring of the liver tissue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Liver cancer: Development of malignant cells in the liver.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early stages often present no symptoms, making early detection challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heart conditions caused by fatty liver disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging research indicates a robust association between fatty liver disease and various cardiovascular conditions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Atherosclerosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty liver disease contributes to the buildup of plaques in arteries, leading to narrowed and hardened arteries. This occurs because excess fat in the liver can increase systemic inflammation and promote the accumulation of cholesterol-rich deposits in blood vessels. Over time, these plaques reduce blood flow, increase blood pressure, and significantly raise the risk of stroke and heart attack. A study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/ATV.0000000000000153" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Hypertension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; discusses how non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which is the principal cause of death in patients with NAFLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you think lifestyle changes can significantly reduce the risk of fatty liver disease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Coronary artery disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with fatty liver are at a higher risk of developing blockages in the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle. The combination of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and chronic inflammation associated with fatty liver accelerates the progression of CAD. This can manifest as chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, or, in severe cases, a heart attack. A study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(25)00112-7/fulltext" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;The Lancet Regional Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; – Europe highlights that metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a severe form of fatty liver disease, can lead to liver scarring (fibrosis), cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and liver cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Heart failure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty liver disease may elevate the risk of heart failure, a condition where the heart cannot pump blood effectively to meet the body’s needs. Chronic metabolic stress from fatty liver can lead to structural and functional changes in the heart, including thickening of the heart walls (left ventricular hypertrophy) and reduced cardiac efficiency. People with fatty liver are also more likely to develop high blood pressure, further contributing to heart failure risk. Additionally, inflammation and insulin resistance associated with fatty liver can strain the cardiovascular system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Arrhythmias&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8238775/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Nature Reviews Gastroenterology and Hepatology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; explores the risk of cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrhythmias in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, highlighting the underlying mechanisms and clinical implications. The presence of fatty liver is linked to an increased risk of abnormal heart rhythms, including atrial fibrillation. Systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and electrolyte imbalances associated with fatty liver can disrupt the electrical signaling of the heart. Arrhythmias can increase the risk of stroke, reduce cardiac efficiency, and, in severe cases, lead to sudden cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, cardiovascular disease has become the leading cause of death in individuals with fatty liver disease, surpassing liver-related complications &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mechanisms linking fatty liver to heart disease&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several mechanisms explain the connection between fatty liver disease and cardiovascular conditions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammation:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic inflammation in the liver can lead to systemic inflammation, affecting blood vessels and heart tissue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insulin resistance&lt;/strong&gt;: Fatty liver is often associated with insulin resistance, a precursor to type 2 diabetes, which is a significant risk factor for heart disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dyslipidemia:&lt;/strong&gt; Altered lipid metabolism in fatty liver disease leads to increased levels of harmful cholesterol and triglycerides, contributing to plaque formation in arteries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oxidative stress:&lt;/strong&gt; Excess fat in the liver can produce reactive oxygen species, damaging blood vessels and heart tissue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These factors collectively increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases in individuals with fatty liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Importance of early detection and management&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the asymptomatic nature of early-stage fatty liver disease, regular screening is crucial, especially for individuals with risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;October brings a bounty of foods that are foundational to the Mediterranean diet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pears, butternut squash, pomegranates and Brussels sprouts are all at their peak.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fall is also an ideal time to stock up on staples, like pecans, lentils and canned pumpkin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By October, cooler temperatures are here to stay. And so is a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cozy-high-fiber-vegetable-side-dishes-fall-8348783" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;new harvest of root vegetables&lt;/a&gt;, winter squash, apples and pears.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fall isn’t just about the produce. It’s also a time when other &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/5-mediterranean-diet-foods-to-buy-every-week-8774524" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;hearty Mediterranean diet staples&lt;/a&gt;, like beans, lentils and nuts, make a frequent appearance on our plates. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, go grab your favorite warm sweater, dig out the stockpot, and load up on these eight Mediterranean diet foods. They’re dietitians’ favorites, so you won’t want to miss them!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-canned-pumpkin"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Canned Pumpkin  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Produce is loaded with antioxidants and fiber that are believed to be behind many of the Mediterranean diet’s health benefits. And pumpkin is no exception.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, October brings an abundance of pumpkin-flavored products to grocery store shelves. But if you want to really reap pumpkin’s nutrition benefits, stick to the basics and stock up on cans of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-canned-pumpkin-puree-taste-test-8730790" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;100% pumpkin&lt;/a&gt; (check that the ingredient list has only pumpkin). It’s free of additives, preservatives and added sugars, yet &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/surprising-antioxidant-rich-foods-you-should-eat-11776388" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;rich in antioxidants like beta carotene&lt;/a&gt;, which protect the body’s cells from oxidative stress&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Canned pumpkin is also a surprising &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-helped-me-eat-more-fiber-11775341" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;source of fiber&lt;/a&gt; (nearly 4 grams per half-cup).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another plus for canned pumpkin: There’s zero prep work involved. Once you’ve stocked up, think beyond pie and add pumpkin to classic fall dishes like soups, oatmeal and pasta. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-lentils"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Lentils &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether they’re canned or dry, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8061834/healthiest-beans-to-eat/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;beans and lentils&lt;/a&gt; are another Mediterranean diet staple. So, be sure to toss some lentils into your shopping cart. “Packed with protein, iron and soluble fiber, they align perfectly with the plant-forward Mediterranean diet,” says &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionbybess.com/old-about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Bess Berger, RDN, CDN, CLT&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just one half-cup of cooked lentils contains an impressive 9 grams of heart-healthy plant protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They also provide 8 grams of fiber, which means you’ll be well on your way to hitting your daily fiber goals (roughly 25 grams per day for women and 38 grams for men). Lentils are also packed with polyphenols, plant-based compounds that tamp down inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While lentils are delicious any time of year,  fall is an ideal time to add them to your meal rotation. Their earthy flavor complements other seasonal vegetables, like carrots, onions and squash, making them a nutrient-dense pantry essential, says Berger. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-pears"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Pears &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Apples may get all the attention, but &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/5-ingredient-stuffed-pears-fall-appetizer-recipe-8385530" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fall is pear season&lt;/a&gt;! “Pears are a sweet October treat that can be enjoyed as a snack, healthful dessert or paired with savory food as a salad topping,” says &lt;a href="https://www.sheridietitian.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sheri Gaw, RDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. They’re not just delicious, they’re also really good for you. Research has found that pears contain nutrients and compounds that may protect against cancer, diabetes and obesity and bolster immune health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For instance, pears are rich in the immune-boosting fiber pectin. They also contain powerful anti-inflammatory compounds, like chlorogenic acid, flavonols and caffeic acid. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, they’re delicious on their own as a snack. But they’re also a nutritious, flavorful addition to salads, pies and oatmeal.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The Mediterranean diet is celebrated for its focus on whole, nutrient-rich foods that promote long-term health, and mushrooms fit right in,” says &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/author/lauren-manaker/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lauren Manaker, M.S., RDN, LDN, CLEC&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not all. Mushrooms are also a surprising &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7898812/how-food-can-help-you-look-and-feel-more-youthful-heres-what-the-science-says/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;source of phytochemicals&lt;/a&gt; that have been shown to protect the brain from oxidative stress. “Research even links certain mushrooms to cognitive function benefits,” says Manaker.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, mushrooms are about more than just their nutrition. They are a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/289565/9-vegetarian-vegan-protein-substitutes/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fantastic meat substitute&lt;/a&gt;. So, they can help you limit red meat—a key principle of the Mediterranean diet—while still enjoying satisfying, flavorful meals, says Manaker. Their rich, umami flavor works well in a variety of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-dinner-recipes-to-get-in-the-fall-spirit-8700976" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;hearty fall-inspired dishes&lt;/a&gt;, like casseroles, pasta and, of course, mushroom soup. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-butternut-squash"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Butternut Squash &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can usually find butternut squash throughout the year. However, fall is when this &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7912796/popular-butternut-squash-recipes-for-fall/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sweet, nutty squash&lt;/a&gt; is at its peak. In return for all that flavor, you’ll score lots of vitamin A, potassium and fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This hearty winter squash is also rich in carotenoids, which may combat inflammation and improve heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like pumpkin, butternut squash can be used in both sweet and savory recipes. Gaw recommends roasting it, blending it into a creamy soup or baking it into a batch of fiber-rich muffins.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nuts are another &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291120/mediterranean-diet-for-beginners-everything-you-need-to-get-started/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet go-to&lt;/a&gt;. While nuts are a convenient, snackable food any time of year, when fall rolls around, think pecans. Their rich, buttery flavors make them a natural for autumn. While pecans don’t get nearly as much attention as other nuts, they should. In addition to providing hard-to-get vitamin E, they’re rich in unsaturated fats, found in abundance in the Mediterranean diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “These healthy fats are beneficial for heart health and can help lower cholesterol,” says &lt;a href="https://prostatecancernutrition.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Brianne Okuszka, M.P.P.D., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Don’t just save pecans for snacks or your Thanksgiving pecan pie. Sprinkle them on oatmeal, pasta and fall-inspired salads. They’re also delicious additions to pumpkin bread, roasted squash, muffins and energy bites. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-7-brussels-sprouts"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 7. Brussels Sprouts &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One vegetable that has had a major glow-up in recent years is the Brussels sprout. The &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/251284/garlic-parmesan-roasted-brussels-sprouts/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;growing season for Brussels sprouts&lt;/a&gt; peaks in the fall months, making it a good time to stock up while they’re at their tastiest. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to their hearty flavor, there are plenty of benefits to eating more of this humble vegetable. For instance, 1 cup of cooked Brussels sprouts adds 4 grams of fiber to your plate. It also provides more than 100% of your day’s worth of vitamin C, an antioxidant that helps &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/80991/10-ways-to-reduce-inflammation/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;tackle inflammation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, you can always roast them until caramelized and crispy in the oven. But why stop there? Shred them raw into salads, stir them into quiche or give them a quick sauté with some thinly sliced shallots. You can’t go wrong with any of these!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-8-pomegranates"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 8. Pomegranates &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Pomegranates peak in autumn and bring bursts of flavor to Mediterranean dishes,” says Berger. Their juicy ruby-red seeds aren’t just pretty to look at. That rich red color comes from antioxidants called anthocyanins, which may protect against chronic inflammation linked to the development of heart disease and cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Those sweet little seeds are also a delicious way to add fiber to your day (4 grams per half-cup).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Sprinkle these pearls over grain bowls, roasted squash or yogurt for a colorful, nutrient-dense boost,” suggests Berger.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you are following the Mediterranean diet, one way to add variety to your meals is to lean into the seasons. October is the perfect time to embrace the bounty of foods that are foundational to the Mediterranean diet. So, load your shopping cart with canned pumpkin, lentils, pears, mushrooms, butternut squash, pecans, Brussels sprouts and pomegranates. Dietitians say they’re filled with nutrients that may &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-top-nutrients-to-fight-inflammation-8675325" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, and that can translate to powerful protection from a long list of chronic illnesses. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, these flavorful foods aren’t just about their nutritional powers. They are extremely versatile, working in an endless array of seasonal recipes, from soups, salads and pastas to quick breads, muffins and more. Add them to your shopping list and stock up!&lt;br&gt;

As you age, you naturally &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/bodyweight-exercises-stop-muscle-loss-after-45/" target="_blank"&gt;lose lean muscle mass&lt;/a&gt; if you don’t actively try to maintain it. That’s where this simple eight-minute morning &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/bodyweight-moves-beat-running-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;bodyweight workout&lt;/a&gt; comes into play. The best part? It’s just as effective as machines and lifting free weights for building strength after 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hernandez breaks down why holding—and building—onto muscle mass is essential as you grow older.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10048873/" target="_blank"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that muscle loss is directly linked to falls, fractures, and even insulin resistance in older adults,” she says. “But here’s what excites me—&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5830901/" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; demonstrate strong evidence that resistance exercises can counter age-related muscle mass loss, muscle weakness, loss of mobility, chronic disease disability, and even premature mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading an active lifestyle through regular strength training can help slow down these age-related declines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Power of Bodyweight Training After 50&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bodyweight training is an easy, sustainable habit to weave into your daily routine. There’s no need to sign up for a pricey gym membership or set up equipment at home. It’s all about prioritizing consistency over intensity, Hernandez notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Eight-minute daily sessions create a sustainable habit that your body can recover from and adapt to, versus exhausting yourself with longer machine sessions that might leave you too tired to repeat consistently,” she adds. “Research indicates bodyweight exercises deliver the same level of resistance training benefits as free weights and machines. Bodyweight exercises activate multiple muscle groups at once while strengthening essential stabilizing muscles because they do not restrict movement to fixed patterns like machines do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One dose, weeks of relief:&lt;/strong&gt; A single psilocybin injection reversed both chronic pain and depression-like symptoms in mice within 24 hours, with effects lasting at least 12 days.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain circuits, not injuries:&lt;/strong&gt; The pain relief came from calming overactive neurons in a mood-and-pain processing region of the brain, not from healing the actual injuries, which remained visible at the study’s end.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Psilocybin worked when it reached the brain’s anterior cingulate cortex but had no effect when injected near the spinal cord, showing pain relief happens in the brain.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gentle balance beats brute force:&lt;/strong&gt; Psilocybin’s partial activation of two serotonin receptors simultaneously proved more effective than fully activating either one alone or blocking pain signals entirely.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain and depression are intertwined:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice with worse pain consistently showed worse anxiety and depression, and psilocybin relieved both simultaneously by rebalancing the same brain circuits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PHILADELPHIA —&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania found that a single treatment with psilocybin, the active compound in magic mushrooms, rapidly reversed both chronic pain and depression-like symptoms in mice. The relief lasted for at least 12 days, the duration of observation after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02068-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, confirms what doctors have long observed but struggled to treat: &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/chronic-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;chronic pain&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t just hurt the body. It rewires the brain, creating psychological suffering that worsens the original pain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chronic-pain-breaks-the-brain-s-thermostat"&gt;Chronic Pain Breaks the Brain’s Thermostat&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team created two types of lasting pain in mice during the four-week study. Some had nerve damage. Others had severe &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/inflammation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;  in their paws. Both groups became hypersensitive to touch and developed what looked like mouse versions of profound &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;. They avoided open spaces, gave up faster in swimming tests, and showed impaired movement coordination.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging revealed the culprit. A region called the anterior cingulate cortex, which processes both the emotional experience of pain and regulates mood, had essentially broken. Think of it like a smoke detector that won’t stop blaring even after the fire’s out. Nerve cells in this area were firing 40% more than they should have been, and they wouldn’t calm down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hitting-the-reset-switch"&gt;Hitting the Reset Switch&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On day 27, researchers gave mice a single &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/psilocybin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;injection of psilocybin&lt;/a&gt;. Within 24 hours, sensitivity to pain dropped to normal levels in both groups. The mice also returned to typical behavior in tests measuring anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The improvements lasted. Even 12 days after the single treatment (when the experiment ended), &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/pain-relief/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pain relief&lt;/a&gt; continued and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/mood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mood&lt;/a&gt; remained stable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The location of psilocybin’s action mattered enormously. When researchers injected &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/how-magic-mushrooms-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;psilocin&lt;/a&gt; (what psilocybin becomes in the body) directly into the anterior cingulate cortex, they saw dramatic improvements. When they injected it into the spinal cord near the injury site, nothing changed. The activity levels that had been 40% above normal dropped back to baseline within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-it-worked"&gt;Why It Worked&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Psilocybin affects two types of serotonin receptors in the brain: 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A. The researchers found it needs both to work its magic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When researchers blocked either one before giving psilocybin, all benefits vanished. Pain returned, anxiety stayed high, depression-like behaviors persisted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But overstimulating those same receptors individually didn’t help either. Maxing out 5-HT2A receptors alone actually increased activity in already overactive circuits. Maxing out 5-HT1A receptors alone decreased activity but provided only modest pain relief and no mood benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Only psilocybin’s partial activation of both receptors simultaneously restored normal &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/brain-activity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain activity&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than blocking pain signals or dampening all brain activity, psilocybin &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/magic-mushrooms-rewire-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recalibrates specific circuits&lt;/a&gt; that chronic pain has knocked out of balance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pain-and-depression-a-two-way-street"&gt;Pain and Depression: A Two-Way Street&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study mapped how chronic pain and depression reinforce each other. Mice with either type of chronic pain showed nearly identical patterns: worse pain correlated with more depression and anxiety, measured across multiple behavioral tests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When researchers examined individual animals, pain severity predicted &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/magic-mushrooms-treat-ptsd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;psychological distress&lt;/a&gt; consistently. Both male and female mice showed the same relationship.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one experiment, mice could choose between two rooms: one where they’d received psilocybin before, and one where they’d gotten saltwater. They spent significantly more time in the psilocybin room. The researchers say this shows the mice associated that space with feeling better, not that they were seeking the drug itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pain relief didn’t come from healing the injury itself. When researchers examined nerve injury sites 40 days later, nerve tangles were still present. The pain reversal came entirely &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/magic-mushroom-brain-connections/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;from changes in the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-people"&gt;What This Means for People&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, while the study used mouse models, keep in mind that human chronic pain involves additional psychological and social complexity. The specific dose, delivery method, and treatment schedule would need extensive testing for human use.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the 50 million &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/1-in-3-americans-constant-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Americans living with&lt;/a&gt; chronic pain, along with the large portion who also battle depression and anxiety, the research offers new understanding of how these conditions intertwine in the brain. If similar effects occur in humans, periodic treatment might someday become possible, but that remains unproven.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early human trials with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/psilocybin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;psilocybin&lt;/a&gt; for chronic pain are already underway, though these remain exploratory. Whether the dramatic effects seen in mice will translate to human patients is uncertain, but the neurobiological insights alone advance understanding of how &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/chronic-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;chronic pain&lt;/a&gt; transforms the brain and why it resists treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers induced chronic pain in adult mice using two established models: spared nerve injury (surgical cutting of two of three sciatic nerve branches) and complete Freund’s adjuvant injection (large-volume inflammatory compound into the footpad). They measured mechanical sensitivity using electronic von Frey testing, which records the precise pressure at which mice withdraw their paws. Anxiety and depression-like behaviors were assessed through elevated plus maze, forced swim test, tail suspension test, open field test, and light/dark box testing. Two-photon calcium imaging in awake, head-fixed mice expressing GCaMP6f allowed real-time visualization of neuronal activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. For drug experiments, researchers used systemic injections of psilocybin (0.5 mg/kg) as well as local applications of psilocin, serotonin receptor agonists, and antagonists. Sample sizes ranged from 5-30 mice per group depending on the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both pain models produced mechanical hypersensitivity lasting over 27 days, with withdrawal thresholds dropping to less than 50% of normal. Increased depression and anxiety-like behaviors coincided with the pain. A single dose of psilocybin on day 27 reversed mechanical allodynia within 24 hours, returning sensitivity to pre-injury levels, with effects persisting through day 40. Mood-related behaviors similarly normalized. Two-photon imaging revealed that chronic pain increased spontaneous neuronal activity in the anterior cingulate cortex by approximately 40%, and local psilocin application reduced the hyperactivity back to baseline within minutes. Bilateral psilocin injection to the anterior cingulate cortex replicated systemic psilocybin’s effects on both pain and mood, while spinal injection had no effect. Blocking either 5-HT2A or 5-HT1A receptors before psilocybin completely prevented therapeutic effects. Full agonism at these receptors individually or combined produced only partial benefits compared to psilocybin’s partial agonist activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted exclusively in rodent models, which may not fully capture the complex nature of human chronic pain. All pain models were induced acutely rather than developing naturally. The relatively short follow-up period (40 days) doesn’t address whether benefits would persist long-term or whether repeated dosing might be necessary. Sex-based analysis was preliminary, with some behavioral tests showing small sample sizes for detecting potential sex differences. The mechanism by which psilocybin induces lasting changes beyond its immediate effects remains unclear. The study didn’t examine potential adverse effects or safety concerns beyond basic behavioral observation. Local drug administration experiments required surgical procedures that might themselves influence pain processing.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Many pharmaceutical drugs come with an ominous list of risks, but the devil is in the details. How likely and dangerous are the side effects, and how do those hazards compare with whatever treatment the drug is meant to provide?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a new study, questions like those may not have received enough attention for one particular drug over the past two decades – and a similar lack of scrutiny may still be exposing patients to excessive dangers from other pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study focuses on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprise-discovery-hair-loss-drug-may-lower-risk-of-heart-disease"&gt;finasteride&lt;/a&gt;, a prescription drug taken by millions of men since the 1990s. It's commonly used to treat male pattern hair loss as well as benign prostatic hyperplasia, or non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/protein-that-calms-waking-hair-follicles-could-lead-to-alopecia-treatment"&gt;Protein That Calms Waking Hair Follicles Could Lead to Alopecia Treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, however, there have been hints of finasteride's effects on mood, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.25nr15862"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; study author Mayer Brezis, a retired nephrologist and medical professor at the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite mounting evidence linking the drug with serious psychiatric side effects – including anxiety,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="176156" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, and suicide – the manufacturers and the medical and regulatory communities have overlooked these findings to the detriment of public health, Brezis &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.25nr15862"&gt;concludes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The literature review encompasses eight studies published between 2017 and 2023 and incorporates data from multiple countries and data systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its findings suggest people who take finasteride face a significantly higher risk of mood disorders and suicidal thoughts than those who don't take it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The evidence is no longer anecdotal," Brezis &lt;a href="https://international.huji.ac.il/news/why-are-we-still-ignoring-suicide-risk-hair-loss-drug"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. "We now see consistent patterns across diverse populations. And the consequences may have been tragic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) listed depression as a potential side effect of finasteride &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2011/020788Orig1s017.pdf"&gt;in 2011&lt;/a&gt;, and added &lt;a href="https://www.hsa.gov.sg/announcements/safety-alert/finasteride-and-potential-risk-of-suicidal-ideation"&gt;suicidality in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, although researchers had raised concerns &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1346-8138.2002.tb00200.x"&gt;as early as 2002&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a trial related to the suicide of one finasteride user, Brezis reports, internal FDA documents revealed the agency's experts had recommended adding "suicidal thoughts and behavior" to the warning label in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The advice was rejected by the agency without disclosing the internal discussion and the rationale for the final decision," Brezis &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.25nr15862"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;. He cites sections of FDA documents that were concealed as confidential, including estimates of the number of people that might be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Transparency is crucial when facing inherent conflicts between innovation and safety, progress and public health," Brezis &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.25nr15862"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA had recorded only 18 suicides associated with finasteride by 2011, yet based on global usage of the drug, the new study suggests the total could be in the thousands. Rather than mere underreporting, Brezis &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.25nr15862"&gt;attributes this&lt;/a&gt; to "a systemic failure of pharmacovigilance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Brezis, this includes failures by the drug's original manufacturer, Merck, to conduct simple safety research using database analyses, as well as regulators neglecting to request such research from the manufacturer or to conduct it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, Merck &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.reuters.com/article/business/exclusive-merck-anti-baldness-drug-propecia-has-long-trail-of-suicide-reports-idUSKBN2A40GV/&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=docs&amp;amp;ust=1759722693098814&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2xlEhPJ_HOgYaNeuTUN4AU"&gt;told Reuters&lt;/a&gt;: "The scientific evidence does not support a causal link between Propecia [a brand name for finasteride] and suicide or suicidal ideation and these terms should not be included in the labeling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Merck works continuously with regulators to ensure that potential safety signals are carefully analyzed and, if appropriate, included in the label for Propecia," they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of the studies in the latest review had been initiated by Merck or by regulators, with a &lt;span&gt;lack of regulatory scrutiny potentially due in part to the drug's classification as cosmetic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finasteride's efficacy against hair loss arises from its interference with the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), although the drug also inhibits the production of certain neurosteroids, such as allopregnanolone, linked to mood regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.09.021"&gt;research on non-human animals&lt;/a&gt;, finasteride has been associated with long-term effects on brain inflammation and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0030-1249095"&gt;structural changes&lt;/a&gt; in the hippocampus, a brain structure involved with learning, memory, and emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if patients stop taking the drug, psychiatric side effects could continue for months or years in a condition known as "post-finasteride syndrome."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have repeatedly &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp068246"&gt;explained how financial interests&lt;/a&gt; can override concerns over drug safety, which is what Brezis suspects happened with finasteride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This apparent failure of pharmacovigilance falls on regulators as well as manufacturers, and the study outlines some takeaways for all parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brezis concludes that medications like finasteride should not be approved unless researchers can clearly establish their safety. Even after a drug like this is approved, he adds, ongoing safety research should be legally required to ensure the approval is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The lesson is that before approving a medication for the market, regulators should require manufacturers to commit to performing and disclosing ongoing post-approval analytical studies, and this requirement needs to be enforced," Brezis &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.09.021"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/analytical-review-depression-suicidality-finasteride/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If this story has raised concerns or you need to talk to someone, &lt;a href="http://www.suicidestop.com/call_a_hotline.html"&gt;please consult this list to find a 24/7 crisis hotline in your country, and reach out for help.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Even as &lt;a href="/future-perfect/406022/usaid-foreign-aid-trump-rubio-cuts-gavi-vaccines"&gt;funding for global health&lt;/a&gt; is declining, the science that supports those efforts is accelerating. And nowhere is that divergence more apparent than in the most important tool in public health: vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Earlier this week Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance — a public-private partnership that does more than any other organization to get vaccines to people in poor countries — &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/gavi-announces-record-setting-year-saving-lives-through-immunisation-2024"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that its vaccines saved a record-breaking 1.7 million people in 2024. That’s 400,000 more lives saved than in 2023, enough to produce some $20 billion in economic benefits through reduced health care costs and healthier, more productive populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In total 72 million children were vaccinated through Gavi last year, &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/2024-wuenic-immunisation-lower-income-countries"&gt;with large gains&lt;/a&gt; in routine vaccine coverage against diseases like polio, measles, pneumonia, and yellow fever. Vaccination rates improved in some of the most fragile and conflict-ridden countries in the world, like Mali, Haiti, and Syria. And in 2024, 17 African countries &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/one-year-anniversary-malaria-vaccine-rollout-underscores-remarkable-progress-offers"&gt;received&lt;/a&gt; the first routine vaccinations against malaria, a disease that still kills an &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/php/impact/index.html"&gt;estimated 600,000 people each year&lt;/a&gt;, primarily in the world’s poorest countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Beneath the headlines, this is the story we should be paying attention to: the quiet, compounding power of vaccines — still the best, most effective bargain in global health — doing what they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The first vaccine was given on May 14, 1796, when English physician Edward Jenner &lt;a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/May-14/jenner-tests-smallpox-vaccine"&gt;scratched&lt;/a&gt; material from a cowpox lesion onto the arm of 8-year-old James Phipps to protect him from smallpox, a disease that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/museum/pdf/cdcm-pha-stem-lesson-smallpox-eradication-lesson.pdf"&gt;killed hundreds of millions of people&lt;/a&gt; before it was finally eradicated in the 20th century. For the first time, doctors had a way not just to treat disease, but to prevent it altogether. In the time since, the number of diseases that can be prevented or blunted by vaccines has only grown — and with it, the number of lives saved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For centuries, though, it was rich nations who reaped most of the benefits of vaccines. But in 1974, the WHO &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/essential-programme-on-immunization"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EIP), a global effort with the initial goal of vaccinating all children against smallpox, tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, and measles by 1990. In the years since, several other diseases like rotavirus were added, and the program became the cornerstone of global routine vaccination efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2824%2900850-X/fulltext?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet &lt;/em&gt;tried to gauge just how effective the EIP has been, and the numbers are remarkable. Over the first 50 years of its existence, the program’s vaccines have saved around 154 million lives, almost all of them young children, and delivered an estimated 10.2 billion years of healthy life. One single shot — the &lt;a href="/health/401130/texas-new-mexico-measles-rfk-hhs-response"&gt;suddenly controversial&lt;/a&gt; measles vaccine — has been responsible for 60 percent of those lives saved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As I’ve &lt;a href="/future-perfect/406291/child-mortality-vaccines-development-usaid-measles-global-health"&gt;written before&lt;/a&gt;, the decline in infant and child mortality in recent decades is the single best reason to be hopeful about the state of the world. Since 1974, vaccines explain roughly two-fifths of the global decline in infant deaths, and they are responsible for over half the decline in Africa specifically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That makes vaccines the single biggest driver of improved infant survival in the modern era. Tens of millions of adults today would have been snuffed out as children without vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While tried and true vaccines still provide the bulk of the benefits, both in rich countries like the US and in the Global South, a new class of vaccines are providing protection against diseases that seemed invulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Chief among them is malaria. As long as that ancient killer has existed, the only way to prevent it has been to not get bitten by mosquitos carrying the malaria parasite. In the US, as my colleague Umair Irfan wrote recently, that meant a long-term effort to wipe out malaria-carrying mosquitoes, and continual work to keep the country safe. In the poor tropical areas of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where those mosquitoes are far more prevalent, however, the best defense has been insecticide-treated bednets that prevent bites at night. Such bednets have saved millions of lives, and have been so effective that they’re &lt;a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/ea-global-2018-amf-rob-mather"&gt;considered the gold standard for effective philanthropy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But even better would be a vaccine that prevents or reduces transmission of the disease altogether. Two new vaccines — RTS,S and R21 — have shown the ability to reduce clinical cases of malaria by around 50 percent in the first year after vaccination. That isn’t perfect, but it’s a huge step forward at a time when climate change and urbanization have amplified the threat of vector-borne illnesses. So far, more than 12 million doses of the vaccine have been delivered since 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s not lost on me that all this good news comes at a time when vaccines are more controversial than ever, thanks to the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-10069-3"&gt;global spread of anti-vax sentiment&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to see where those attitudes can lead, just look at the US, where the drop in measles vaccination rates has &lt;a href="/health/418961/measles-outbreak-cases-vaccine-trump-rfk"&gt;directly led&lt;/a&gt; to the worst measles outbreak in the country in 30 years. Or Europe, which in 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/13-03-2025-european-region-reports-highest-number-of-measles-cases-in-more-than-25-years---unicef--who-europe"&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; the highest number of measles cases in 25 years. The Trump administration’s moves to &lt;a href="/today-explained-podcast/459432/covid-vaccine-rfk-trump-mrna"&gt;slash funding&lt;/a&gt; for mRNA research risk cutting off one of the most promising areas for future vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In rich countries, turning away from vaccines is a perversely self-inflicted wound, one that can be afforded only because vaccines have allowed us to forget the toll of these dieseases. But in the poorest countries in the world, many children aren’t getting vaccinated not because they won’t, but because they can’t. Over 14 million infants in 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/global-childhood-vaccination-holds-steady-yet-over-14-million-infants-remain"&gt;received&lt;/a&gt; no vaccines whatsoever, an increase of 1.4 million from 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Progress is precarious. Holding the miraculous gains made by vaccines will require reaching those zero-dose infants, tamping down measles outbreaks where coverage slipped, and resisting political moves to defund mRNA vaccine research that speeds responses to new threats. If we can do that, this year’s record will be next year’s baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter. &lt;a href="/pages/good-news-newsletter-signup"&gt;Sign up here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxPanNYdDJHWGl2cmw5Y1RUalRrWS1GUVNZWEZDOFpTek1aMG4wMjB3MkFLTFF4TTh6UjJnS1lHMmhUd0cyUVY4aU5tVW5QN1Z4cmVtRHVzd0U2OFJHenFTY2QwMW9vaG42WDdMQXpXcmczSDQtaGNSLTFtamRyQUJSX0dWMlNaZUZwb0NjLTFhdUg</guid></item><item><title>一位大胆的医生将她的孩子送走了，并帮助击败了世界上最致命的病毒之一- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/10/06/g-s1-91435/virus-marburg-deadly-disease-rwanda</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                Dr. Tsion Firew at her home in Kigali, Rwanda, on Oct. 3. A year ago, Rwanda announced the country's first Marburg outbreak — a deadly virus that's a cousin to Ebola. Firew, who is chair of emergency medicine at Africa Health Sciences University in Rwanda, was afraid for herself and her kids. She sent them away, updated her life insurance — and helped quash the outbreak.&lt;br&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Tsion Firew had just finished running a first aid training when she glanced down at her phone — and then looked up confused.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The message she saw was about a colleague Firew had worked with a few days earlier in the emergency department at King Faisal Hospital in Kigali, Rwanda. "She's very young, full of energy, one of the smartest nurses I've ever worked with," recalls Firew, who is chair of emergency medicine at Africa Health Sciences University in Rwanda.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The message simply said: "Pray for her."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Firew rejiggered her schedule and made a trip to the intensive care unit. As Firew peeked around the screen that divided the patients, she saw the young energetic nurse and was taken aback. The woman was almost "lifeless." Eyes barely open. Not recognizing familiar faces.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It was quite scary, because you had no idea what you were dealing with," Firew says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Soon it became clear.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This was one of those moments where the job of a health care worker can quickly go from risky to deadly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On September 27, 2024 Rwanda announced the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/10/01/nx-s1-5133987/marburg-virus-rwanda-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;country's first Marburg outbreak&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — a deadly virus that's a cousin to Ebola. For Firew, it was the beginning of a harrowing journey. She sent her 1- and 3-year-old children to another country. She faced pressure from her family to stop working as an emergency room doctor for her own safety. And she hallucinated from sheer exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Now, a year later, the basics of &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2415816" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the outbreak&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Rwanda are known. It most likely started with a 27-year-old miner who caught the virus from a bat in a rural mining tunnel. It ended on December 20, 2024 and had garnered &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/11/01/g-s1-30948/virus-marburg-outbreak-rwanda-unprecedented-success" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;international renown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a model for a successful outbreak response.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Marburg is notorious for its high death rate, sometimes killing almost &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;9 out of every 10 patients&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But the small country in east-central Africa achieved the lowest death rate ever recorded in an outbreak: 23%. Only 15 of the 66 Marburg patients died. Of all the Marburg patients in Rwanda, more than three-quarters were health care workers, many were Firew's friends and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Firew says the experience has taught her to hone the skill of compartmentalizing — tucking away the Marburg memories so she can continue her work as a physician and mother. But, on this anniversary, she's letting herself relive those first few days and weeks of the outbreak. And she's reflecting on the state of the world today and why it needs the lessons learned from the Marburg outbreak more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"This is real"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After seeing her colleague, Firew stepped into the hallway and moved to a discreet corner. "I was overcome with emotion — crying," says Firew, who has been practicing medicine for 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A colleague saw her. "He consoled me. He hugged me," Firew recalls.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She went home to put her kids to bed. They read and prayed for the colleague's "ouchie." Then another text arrived — from the colleague who'd comforted her: "I've developed a fever. I'm in an isolation unit."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Soon another message lit up her phone: The young nurse had died, leaving behind her partner and a toddler.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That's when I was like: Oh God. This is — this is real," Firew says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Her mind was racing. She knew that Marburg was deadly, that it had &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/marburg/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;no approved treatment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and that it was very contagious, spreading through bodily fluid — even sweat. Closing her eyes, she replayed that hug in the ICU hallway. What if she'd been exposed to Marburg?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was just extremely scary," she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Half her mind was working on her emergency department's strategy for such a deadly disease. The other half was preoccupied with an urgent question: What should she do about her children?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Telling a 1-year-old and a 3-year-old: 'Stay in a corner. Don't touch me!' was not going to fly," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And her husband wasn't able to help. He was stuck in the U.S. An engineering consultant, he'd gone there for work&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and dropped by his parents in Atlanta for a quick visit. Then came Hurricane Helene. "He couldn't even get out of his parents' house because there were trees everywhere," Firew says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;She realized she had no choice but to send her kids away. They flew to Ethiopia, where her parents live, accompanied by an adult cousin and nanny.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;All the while her phone was dinging with messages from colleagues who were developing symptoms. "They would go isolate. They'd test positive," she says. "And then, especially in the first three, four days, most of them died."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Mommy, I need you"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Firew had decided not to tell her parents about the Marburg outbreak. She didn't want to scare them. Instead, she said something vague about sending the kids for an Ethiopian holiday. But the day after the kids arrived, her parents called. It was about Firew's 3-year-old: He'd developed a fever.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Of course, I freak out," Firew says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Could she have infected her son? The young boy gets on the phone, Firew remembers his words: " 'Mommy, I need you now. Where are you? Why are you not with me?' "&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For a moment, Firew says, she let her emotions clouded her judgement. She bought a ticket to Ethiopia. Then she canceled it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The grandparents took him to the hospital and Firew went to her own hospital, where Rwandan health officials had already set up Marburg testing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She got tested and, since she didn't have any concerning symptoms, she went to work. She put on full protective gear — stretching it here and swimming in it there since it was not designed for female bodies. Soon she was caring for Marburg patients, including the colleague who'd given her the hug in the hallway.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"He was on the verge of dying," she recalls. "The course of the disease, for me, was extremely shocking. I called it the kiss of death. There's bleeding from the mouth, and other orifices" — their gums, their nose.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Hearing voices"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The fear followed Firew home that night, where she called up a good friend, Dr. Craig Spencer, who'd lived through Ebola and was himself infected. She remembers telling him, "I can't think clearly right now. My colleagues are dying every day. Could I be next?"&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Spencer urged her to think through the practical steps. So Firew upped her life insurance policy. Asking herself: If I die, how much will my family realistically need?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After five days, Firew had hardly slept. Alone and exhausted in her empty house, she says, she started hallucinating. "I was hearing voices. It was voices of my colleagues," she says. "Right when I'm about to doze off, they'd wake me up."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The most vivid voice is that of her colleague who'd given her that hug. She hears him calling her name, repeatedly. She hears the beeping of the hospital machines that are working to save him.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was just a complete nightmare — I mean, that's an understatement," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, the next day, she got up and went into the hospital where she was running the clinic and had a long list of patients. She went despite the fact that relatives, who'd seen what was happening on the news, begged her not to go. They urged her to leave it all behind for the sake of her kids, her family.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-91491" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"No Marburg deniers"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Firew was adamant. She could not leave. Her test had come back negative. She did not have Marburg and neither, it turns out, did her son. He had tonsillitis and would be fine. She had to keep doing her part, she told them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Part of what made her so resolute was the contrast she felt between this outbreak and her experience as a doctor in New York City during the height of COVID. That time, she says, she felt like the U.S. government was sometimes working at cross purposes with the medical community. This time, she felt, the Rwandan government was working hard to do things right.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It had set up testing and isolation wards right away. It started a clinical trial for a Marburg vaccine within 10 days of declaring an outbreak. And there were plenty of gloves and protective gowns.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"They were no Marburg deniers. There were a lot of COVID deniers," she recalls thinking.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Firew had an idea to do something never before tried for Marburg: Start people who'd been exposed to the virus on an experimental treatment — remdesivir — even before they had symptoms. Remdesivir is a drug Firew used often when she was a physician in New York during COVID. She knew it was safe and was being used experimentally for Marburg in non-human primates. But why not start it prophylactically, in the hopes it could guard against the disease or lessen the virus's impact when it strikes?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The idea was bought on that Tuesday. It was started on that Wednesday, and we gave it to over 150 health care workers that had high risk exposures," she recalls, saying the research on the impact is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Her colleague, the one from the hallway, is among those who came back from the brink. In another experimental procedure run by the World Health Organization and others, Firew and colleagues gave him the first ever infusion of monoclonal antibodies for a Marburg patient. That monoclonal antibody — which was given to others too — was designed to bind to the Marburg virus and neutralize it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Just to be part of this extraordinary response is such a big — I guess I'll say, a big opportunity," Firew says. She says she the initial fear she felt is now tempered by feelings of pride for the work she did and gratitude for the colleagues she worked alongside and the family members that supported her. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, as Firew looks at the news, she says her memories of Marburg have resurfaced. Watching as scientific facts questioned and public health approaches upended in the U.S., she says, she wishes the world could see Rwanda's response as proof of what a deep belief in science can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"The discussions about public health can be so discouraging," she says. "But I look back and see: This work, this effort did not go to waste. It is not futile."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She still thinks about whether she could have saved just one more life. But she also thinks about a moment six weeks after the outbreak started, when she and her husband decided it was finally safe for him and the kids to return home to Rwanda.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-91499" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Tsion Firew was finally reunited with her family at the airport in Kigali after being apart for six weeks. Firew says she hugged her 3-year-old son from the arrivals area all the way to the parking lot. "In crisis, we often ask, 'Why me?' But perhaps the better question is: 'What now?'" says Firew.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"My three-year-old, he ran across the airport when he saw me and it was like this prolonged hug — he just did not want to let go of me," she recalls through tears. "It was a feeling that I've never had before."&lt;/p&gt;

Instead, she was given 'devastating' news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After giving her an injection to try and stop her post-birth bleeding, doctors were still unable to prevent Danika from hemorrhaging and ordered her a blood test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within 30 minutes, the results revealed that Danika had acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a rare and aggressive form of blood cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, around 22,000 people are diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) each year, and it is the most common form of acute leukemia in adults, characterized by its rapid progression over the course of a few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it's uncommon in people under the age of 45. The average age of people when they are first diagnosed with AML is about 69, and it is uncommon in people under the age of 45. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hilmer's case was highly unusual as she was just 32 at the time of her diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After doctors discovered the leukemia in her blood, the new mom had her newborn taken from her arms and was rushed to another hospital to start chemotherapy treatment immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Anika Hilmer, 34, in the hospital with her newborn son Banks Mohwinkle and older sons Beckett, 13, and Perry, 8. Hours later, she discovered she had a rare cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After doctors discovered the leukemia in her blood, the new mom had her newborn taken from her arms and was rushed to another hospital to start chemotherapy treatment immediately&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hilmer stayed in the hospital for a month, leaving her then fiancé to care for their tiny son and the other two children, until she was able to return home a few days before &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/thanksgiving/index.html" id="mol-37ac3140-a068-11f0-8797-d139455908ff" class=""&gt;Thanksgiving&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The stay-at-home mom underwent two further rounds of chemotherapy followed by a successful stem cell transplant in January 2023 and has been in remission since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hilmer says giving birth that day 'saved her life' and fears what stage the cancer would have been detected at if the blood test had been carried out any later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The time course of AML progression can vary, but it typically progresses within weeks to months, with the number of abnormal cells in the blood increasing quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike solid tumors, AML doesn't use a traditional stage numbering system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms of AML, such as fatigue, weakness, unintentional weight loss, and night sweats, are often missed as they are vague and can be mistaken for common illnesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the disease progresses, they can become more apparent, with easy bruising, bone pain, frequent infections, and significant enlargement of the spleen or liver, raising concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The five-year survival rate is around 30 percent. Hilmer says she experienced no unusual symptoms during her pregnancy other than sciatica, a pain, numbness, or tingling that starts in the lower back or buttocks and radiates down the leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She believes that if it weren't for her pregnancy, she might not have caught the cancer in time.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hilmer said: 'This pregnancy absolutely saved my life. I went to the hospital that morning fully anticipating just having a baby, and that was it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'After I had him, I was haemorrhaging so I was losing a lot of blood, and the doctors and nurses were unable to get it to stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They tried to give me a shot at one point to stop the bleeding, but it didn't work.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bleeding after pregnancy is normal and called lochia, but excessive bleeding, large clots, or foul odor may signal a complication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hilmer continued bleeding for around an hour after giving birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At one point, the doctors considered sending her for a hysterectomy to stop it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But before opting for the procedure, the doctor who performed the delivery decided to order blood work to see if that could reveal what was behind the excessive bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In the US, around 22,000 people are diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) each year and it is the most common form of acute leukemia in adults, characterized by its rapid progression over the course of a few weeks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hilmer says giving birth that day 'saved her life' and fears what stage the cancer would have been detected at if the blood test had been carried out any later&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unexpectedly, the doctor returned and explained to Hilmer that she had AML. Topping things off, she also found out she had Covid, so she had to be cared for in an isolation room, treated with medical staff wearing layers of personal protective equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recalled: 'They ended up taking a blood sample, and it only took 30 minutes for it to come back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The doctor came back into the room to tell me that the results showed that I had acute myeloid leukemia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My fiancé and I were both in shock. My baby was taken out of my arms, and I was rushed away to a different hospital where I had to start chemotherapy right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I am very thankful that the doctor decided to do blood work instead of that surgery because I probably wouldn't be here today. My platelet counts were so low that I would not have been able to stop bleeding.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Platelets help blood clot, making them essential for stopping bleeding and healing wounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because she had no symptoms, the mother-of-three said the diagnosis came as a complete 'shock'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I kept thinking that when I got to the other hospital, they would tell me it was wrong, but when I got there, they confirmed that it was true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I spent the next month in hospital, going through chemo, and it was very depressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was hormonal because I'd just had a baby that I could not be with and was only allowed a couple of visits from my newborn, as well as my other two children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was isolating. I was not doing very well mentally at that time because it was all so much.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hilmer, pictured here, says she experienced no unusual symptoms during her pregnancy other than sciatica, a pain, numbness, or tingling that starts in the lower back or buttock and radiates down the leg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hilmer, pictured with her partner and their three children, hopes sharing her story will highlight the importance of preventive health care&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After undergoing a stem cell transplant, Hilmer said it took another year before she had her strength and energy back and felt like herself again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A stem cell transplant allows doctors to give higher doses of chemotherapy than normally could be given. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The process involves high-dose chemotherapy to eliminate leukemia cells and stem cells, followed by the infusion of healthy donor stem cells, which can then target and destroy remaining cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The blood-forming stem cells used for a transplant can come either from blood or from bone marrow. Sometimes stem cells from a baby’s umbilical cord blood are used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thanks to the stem cell transplant, Hilmer made a recovery. However, this June, she found out she&lt;span&gt; has Stage 1 invasive ductal carcinoma breast cancer, and she underwent a double mastectomy to treat it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Invasive ductal carcinoma, also known as infiltrating ductal carcinoma or IDC, is the most common form of breast cancer, accounting for 80 percent of all breast cancer diagnoses. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It occurs when abnormal cells growing in the lining of the milk ducts change and invade breast tissue beyond the walls of the duct. Once that happens, the cancer cells can spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hilmer hopes sharing her story will highlight the importance of preventive health care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 11:19:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxPUXc5UWNUeXZhbjZQX0lLVU4xMFlFbnBRcmlrZl9IX0FkUGx3ampveVZxajZjdU1HTXFQbUZGbWJEN0hJa1p1QjREVXZTZnBpQXFsMWEtUUU4aVZUZGF3MTJiVHRwQ0tDd1BFUGhYUWQ3Mks0eFUxcXdrVUIzbDY4SnRld1hXX3FnVmlLN1lLMHRMT1pra3dTQktkWXdLUUpzamRHRlJ3WDN5ZlpFZ01FNTNhTkNsclhU</guid></item><item><title>日本使用激光无人机吓唬农场鸟类并降低禽流感风险- TechSpot</title><link>https://www.techspot.com/news/109747-japan-uses-laser-drones-scare-birds-farms-cut.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TechSpot</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 11:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxOZktXS0RtZzFuSzFxQy1CdjZfSm0yTGdwSzlFcnd3a2lkaXRxQmRTNDFVTDh4c1lyR1R4S1BOb092QjkzVW5LTG5jS3N3M3dSZ2x0NjA4bGNFS0l6cVh0enJ6WGhsZF8zcDh3SkR5UXMyX1dVN1NqblZtdmNFQWpFZHFFLW5UMVFsLS15OTlIQ2Y</guid></item><item><title>自闭症不是单一的疾病，没有单一的原因，科学家得出结论-连线</title><link>https://www.wired.com/story/autism-is-not-a-single-condition-and-has-no-single-cause-scientists-conclude/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;New research from&lt;/span&gt; the University of Cambridge suggests that autism should not be understood as a homogeneous condition with a single cause. Scientists found that people diagnosed in early childhood often have a different genetic profile than those diagnosed later in life, broadening the understanding of how the condition develops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09542-6"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; analyzed the behavior of autistic people during childhood and adolescence in the United Kingdom and Australia. It also evaluated genetic data of more than 45,000 patients with the condition from diverse cohorts in Europe and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;By linking genetic information to age at diagnosis, the researchers observed that the profiles of those identified early with the condition differed from those who received confirmation at later stages. They found only a slight overlap between the two groups, indicating that the biological mechanisms associated with autism in childhood may be different from those linked to autism identified in adolescence or adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The analysis, published last week in the journal Nature, showed that children diagnosed before the age of 6 were more likely to have behavioral difficulties—such as problems with social interaction—from an early age. In contrast, those diagnosed after the age of 10 were more likely to experience social and behavioral difficulties during adolescence. They also had a greater predisposition to mental health conditions, such as depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The study adds that the average genetic profile of those diagnosed later was closer to that of &lt;a href="https://es.wired.com/articulos/los-diagnosticos-de-tdah-estan-aumentando-en-ninos-y-adolescentes-revela-un-nuevo-informe"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt; and conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder than to that of “classic” autism identified in early childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The study concludes that the timing of diagnosis is not entirely random but reflects underlying genetic differences that, in some cases, coincide with risk for other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“For the first time, we have found that earlier and later diagnosed autism have different underlying biological and developmental profiles,” said Varun Warrier, a researcher in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge and lead author of the paper, in a &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/study-reveals-genetic-and-developmental-differences-in-people-with-earlier-versus-later-autism" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/study-reveals-genetic-and-developmental-differences-in-people-with-earlier-versus-later-autism"}' href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/study-reveals-genetic-and-developmental-differences-in-people-with-earlier-versus-later-autism" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt;. “The term ‘autism’ likely describes multiple conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOYXJLZFN6Wm1USzhpNFUtbkY3aS1oZVBhdVpwR0cxX0lVMTlLSDNzckFtelN0dTU4Yk9BNW14Y0FMYWFGaGZwTkZERkd5ZG9wV3JYdkROM0hMWEVkYzE2UmR6Z3A4em1acVREdEhNa0ZBTEM0anpFaVZZY0VzTTZHRzNVSmh1Z2lna0xydkkzbXZFM25RM0ZXQmpDRkZUclJqVExuaFdtQTY</guid></item><item><title>四种有助于预防痴呆的常规疫苗-《每日电讯报》</title><link>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/dementia/four-vaccines-help-prevent-dementia/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Why do vaccines have such a potent effect on brain health?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;1. They prevent infections that raise your risk of dementia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some viruses, such as the varicella-zoster virus which causes shingles, can lie dormant in your central nervous system for decades, causing inflammation and having an impact on brain cells. According to the Alzheimer’s Society, other infections that have been linked to dementia include pneumonia, syphilis, Lyme disease and gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a growing body of evidence showing that viruses that hibernate in your nervous system for much of your life may be implicated in the development of neurodegenerative diseases,” says Pascal Geldsetzer, the Stanford epidemiologist who has carried out shingles vaccine research. “The varicella-zoster virus is in a constant interplay with the immune system throughout life, causing inflammation in the nervous system. Reducing this through shingles vaccination may well have a dementia-protecting effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also possible that some viruses may directly attack the brain. &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10090407/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Studies have even&lt;/a&gt; indicated that some flu strains are capable of inducing the loss of brain cells and leading to neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would explain why vaccines which block these pathogens are protective against dementia, but researchers don’t believe it’s the full story. First, they think it’s highly unlikely that such a wide range of pathogens are all causing dementia, while some of the vaccines have only been around for a couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With Alzheimer’s, for example, we think it takes two decades to go from the first development of plaques and tangles to enough cell death for dementia symptoms to appear,” says Rudolph Tanzi, a neurology professor at Harvard Medical School. “So if an infection is the root cause, new vaccines that have just been around for a few years shouldn’t be associated with protection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;2. Vaccines also boost the brain’s immunity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Tanzi explains that every time you get a vaccine it ramps up the body’s wider immune response – known as the peripheral immune response. This leads to white blood cells infiltrating the brain and cleansing it of the toxic plaques which drive Alzheimer’s disease in particular. “When these cells get into the brain, they can efficiently clear amyloid plaques,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One study used genetically engineered mice and put them in an Alzheimer’s-like disease state so that they developed plaques in their brains. When researchers experimented further on the mice to ramp up their peripheral immune response, they saw that the white blood cells moved into the brain and began “chewing up” plaques, as Prof Tanzi puts it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What I believe is that if you’ve had even just a few vaccines, you’re lowering your amyloid plaque load,” he says. “You’re blowing out the masses that are going to cause this disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Should you ask for the latest vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the Covid-19 vaccines, most vaccines are regularly updated and improved. A good example is the flu vaccine, which is updated every year as the virus mutates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One particularly intriguing discovery has been Harrison’s finding that the newer Shingrix vaccine appears to offer more dementia protection than the older Zostavax shingles vaccine. He believes this could be because Shingrix contains an adjuvant – a substance added to a vaccine to enhance the immune response, particularly in older individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The question is whether it’s more effective because it’s a better shingles vaccine and so better at suppressing the virus, or is it because it has this adjuvant which the older vaccine didn’t have?” says Harrison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Tanzi’s belief is that all vaccines containing adjuvants are likely to be more effective in preventing dementia because they ramp up the immune response to a greater extent. “The greater the immune activation, the more amyloid you’re going to clear and provide protection for the future,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not you can get the latest vaccine depends on the condition it is targeting. For example, if you have already been vaccinated with the Zostavax shingles vaccine, the NHS says you are not eligible for the Shingrix vaccine. However, you should ensure you are up-to-date with the latest flu vaccine each year so that it effectively protects against the virus, and ask your GP about the RSV vaccine programme that was launched last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Why it’s so important to stay on top of your vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all this is correct, it could point towards new treatments for Alzheimer’s in particular. Rather than spending thousands on expensive treatments to clear out plaque in our brains, we could simply stimulate the immune system to do this for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also implies that many of us could benefit from our immune system’s natural abilities to cleanse our brain, simply by taking our freely available mid and later-life vaccines. Some of the recent studies have indicated that women, in particular, experience greater dementia protection after taking their vaccines, for reasons which are unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Women are at greater risk of Alzheimer’s, certainly, and for a long time it was thought that’s because they live longer,” says Paresh Malhotra, a neurology professor at Imperial College London and a trustee of the Alzheimer’s Society. “But it doesn’t look like it’s that alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the evidence grows that vaccines can protect the brain in later life, there is also an argument that we should perhaps start having them sooner, maybe even as early as our 40s and 50s. Malhotra says that while the shingles vaccine is currently available to 70 to 79-year-olds and those turning 65 on or after September 1 2023 on the NHS, the Government is planning to make it available to all over-60s within the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the NHS we’re all offered the shingles vaccine when we reach 70, but the uptake so far, I believe, has been less than 40 per cent,” says Harrison. “At the very least, I think, this recent data provides another reason to have the vaccine when you’re offered it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Tanzi, who has recently turned 67, believes there is a good argument that to protect our brains in mid and later life we should get ourselves vaccinated whenever the chance arises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This past year, I got a Covid booster, RSV, pneumonia [the pneumococcal vaccine], and I’m getting flu next week,” he says. “I look at that as four different clean-ups.”&lt;/p&gt;
