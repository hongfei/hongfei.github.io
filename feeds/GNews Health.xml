The virus has infected 70 people since last year, and federal health officials had previously described the effort as critical to strengthening the country’s pandemic preparedness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JBGY23GE6FF3FF6YTEC6OUHLXU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The company was developing vaccines using messenger RNA — the same technology used in the most commonly administered coronavirus vaccines hailed as a major medical achievement during the first Trump administration. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been critical of mRNA vaccines, and this week he announced the coronavirus shots would &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/27/covid-vaccine-children-recommendation-rfk/" target="_blank"&gt;no longer be recommended&lt;/a&gt; for healthy children and healthy pregnant women.

The move by HHS throws the future of the effort into uncertainty, and the company said it will explore alternatives for late-stage development and manufacturing of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AK5DN222LZCHLNJ74NPE4EWXJI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“These clinical data in pandemic influenza underscore the critical role mRNA technology has played as a countermeasure to emerging health threats,” Stéphane Bancel, Moderna’s CEO, said in a statement touting the interim data on the bird flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HWIDGBYEW5HTXGPQBFTMRTYL3Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In a statement, HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said the decision was made after a “rigorous review.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O73CWRBWIJD6RFNLQNMT47MDQM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“This is not simply about efficacy — it’s about safety, integrity, and trust,” Nixon said. “The reality is that mRNA technology remains under-tested, and we are not going to spend taxpayer dollars repeating the mistakes of the last administration, which concealed legitimate safety concerns from the public.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MCSZ3GUHLJF5BKP7W7MMO4SJTY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Since the H5N1 outbreak began in&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/04/01/bird-flu-human-case-cow-texas/" target="_blank"&gt; dairy cattle &lt;/a&gt;in spring 2024, more than 1,000 herds have been infected in 17 states, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.

He had seen it advertised for improving liver health on social media. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a week later, Grafton noticed &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14571833/toxic-liver-disease-face-skin-rosacea-signs.html"&gt;his urine had turned dark&lt;/a&gt;, he felt nauseous, lost his appetite and was constantly itchy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Believing his deteriorating health was tied to the supplements, he stopped consuming them and went to the hospital out of fear that he was suffering from liver failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Testing revealed he had a drug-induced liver injury, or DILI, which caused damage to his liver due because of his excessive turmeric consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A DILI is often caused by any kind of medication or supplement that claims to promote muscle growth or reduce stress. These types of supplements often contain similar ingredients that can harm the liver when consumed in excess. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Robert Grafton, 54, a New Jersey father-of-five is warning people of taking 'herbal' supplements after he was left fighting for his life due to a rare liver injury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Grafton told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/supplements-drug-induced-liver-damage-toxic-hepatitis-what-know-rcna208390"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;: 'My liver enzymes were super elevated, my bilirubin (a yellowish pigment produced after red blood cell breakdown) was really high - all the signs of liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I pretty much broke down, my wife as well. I was, at that point, thinking it was liver cancer, pancreatic cancer or something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It turns out I had something called a drug-induced liver injury, which came from my supplements.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The liver is responsible for numerous bodily functions, including filtering blood, processing nutrients and detoxifying the body of harmful substances, such as alcohol and drugs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is also responsible for providing support to the immune system, clotting blood and producing bile, a fluid that helps digest fats and absorb nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, sometimes an excessive consumption of ultra-concentrated supplements, whether they are of natural ingredients or those chemically made, can cause an injury if the liver isn't able to effectively filter them out of the body, causing them to build up in toxic amounts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Dina Halegoua-De Marzio, a hepatologist who treated Grafton told NBC: 'I think people assume these things are safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The Number one reason we see people taking these are for good health or to supplement their health and so I don't think that they realize that there is a real risk here.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She noted that even though Grafton had stopped taking supplements after noticing he was sick, a turmeric overload had already occurred in his body and caused an injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Grafton was taking turmeric pills that contained 2,250 milligrams of curcumin, a substance that comes from the root of the turmeric plant and black pepper extract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it remains unclear which turmeric-filled supplement Grafton took, an average turmeric and curcumin supplement tablet brought at common convenience stores contains 500mgs of the spice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts claim a daily consumption of less than 2,000mgs of turmeric through supplements is considered safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Dr Dina Halegoua-De Marzio, a Jefferson Health hepatologist who treated Grafton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While it remains unclear which turmeric-filled supplement Grafton took, an average turmeric and curcumin supplement tablet contains 500 milligrams of the spice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Halegoua-De Marzio said: 'When you cook with turmeric, that could be really safe. But some of the supplements now are 2,000mgs plus, which is a very high dose of turmeric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Coupled with black pepper, the liver now has to break down that supplement and it can't. It could make it really sick.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Numerous studies have shown turmeric can improve liver health by decreasing inflammation, reducing the accumulation of fat and detoxifying the organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, other studies suggest natural supplements made with turmeric can also cause serious liver injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2010 peer-reviewed study showed over 40,000 Americans report liver damage due to medications and supplements annually - out of which over 2,000 end up dying because of the severity of their condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But despite scientific evidence, herbal supplements continue to become more popular. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2024 JAMA Network study found that turmeric is the most commonly consumed supplement in the US, followed by green tea extract, ashwagandha, Garcinia cambogia, red yeast rice and black cohosh. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found 15.6million Americans take supplements containing at least one of these six botanicals - mostly without a doctor's advice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration considers herbal supplements as dietary supplements and does not regulate, oversee or approve them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Therefore, it is impossible for consumers to know whether they re actually consuming what is advertised or if it is safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In April 2025, Jenny Ramirez, experienced liver failure that she linked to methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), an ingredient in a common over-the-counter vitamin that claims to improve hair, skin and nail health &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Grafton is not the only person to suffer from DILI or serious liver damage due to a supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In April 2025, Jenny Ramirez, experienced liver failure due to a typically innocuous ingredient called methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), which is in common over-the-counter vitamins that claim to improve hair, skin and nail health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has found MSM to be generally benign and even protective against liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some scientists have said, however, that MSM could exacerbate liver damage in people with pre-existing liver disease, though research and data are limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, Ramirez became jaundiced, with yellowing skin and eyes. She also had to undergo surgery to remove her gallbladder because of hard deposits that had built up there, blocking the flow of bile through the liver and gallbladder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in 2023, a 45-year-old woman was found to be suffering from herbal supplement-induced liver injury after she complained of gastric pain and nausea from consuming an herbal tea for three days to improve immunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Over 40,000 Americans report liver damage due to medications and supplements annually&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Responding doctors noted she showed no signs of jaundice, had a non-tender abdomen and showed signs of liver infection such as Hepatitis A. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after a series of tests and exams, they found that the presence of reishi mushroom, aloe vera and Siberian ginseng - all natural herbs - had caused her pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for Grafton, after finding out he had a liver injury, Grafton said his blood work had returned to normal within weeks of ceasing the supplements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additional testing revealed no permanent damage to his liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'The whole push with that is that you're getting a super-high, concentrated dose of turmeric and dandelion root and milk thistle, which I have always known from my medical past is good for liver health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It all sounded good, I thought I did enough digging.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because on his experience, he added: 'I don’t take any supplements whatsoever.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 01:58:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>特朗普政府取消开发禽流感疫苗的计划- NPR | Trump administration cancels plans to develop a bird flu vaccine - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE9rNVhYVnAyWUlrVnhraW9hWFZUUEdzdVlsazkwTkFxb1V0bXVYQXRYSjFiMkFmYmNfQWk3Q21qUnlMUWVZalhRQU9XUkpKb2lUN3pMX182U0hxMjN6MnpBOXdRZXY1MW9hMFdWOU01dGk2d0xobjB1Rl96SVI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The federal government announced Wednesday that it is cancelling a contract to develop a vaccine to protect people against flu viruses that could cause pandemics, including the bird flu virus that's been &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/13/nx-s1-5296672/cdc-bird-flu-study-mmwr-veterinarians" target="_blank"&gt;spreading among dairy cows &lt;/a&gt;in the U.S., citing concerns about the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5325863/nih-trump-vaccine-hesitancy-mrna-research" target="_blank"&gt;safety of the mRNA technology&lt;/a&gt; being used.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services said it is terminating a $766 million contract with the vaccine company Moderna to develop an mRNA vaccine to protect people against flu strains with pandemic potential, including the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/27/1263339284/bird-flu-update-influenza" target="_blank"&gt;H5N1 bird flu virus that's been raising fears&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"After a rigorous review, we concluded that continued investment in Moderna's H5N1 mRNA vaccine was not scientifically or ethically justifiable," HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is not simply about efficacy — it's about safety, integrity, and trust. The reality is that mRNA technology remains under-tested, and we are not going to spend taxpayer dollars repeating the mistakes of the last administration, which concealed legitimate safety concerns from the public," Nixon said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He added that "the move signals a shift in federal vaccine funding priorities toward platforms with better-established safety profiles and transparent data practices. HHS remains committed to advancing pandemic preparedness through technologies that are evidence-based, ethically grounded, and publicly accountable." The official did not provide any additional details.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/jnuzzo" target="_blank"&gt;Jennifer Nuzzo&lt;/a&gt;, the director of Brown University's Pandemic Center, said the decision was "disappointing, but unsurprising given the politically-motivated, evidence-free rhetoric that tries to paint mRNA vaccines as being dangerous."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"While there are other means of making flu vaccines in a pandemic, they are slower and some rely on eggs, which may be in short supply," Nuzzo added in an email. "What we learned clearly during the last influenza pandemic is there are only a few companies in the world that make flu vaccines, which means in a pandemic there won't be enough to go around. If the U.S. wants to make sure it can get enough vaccines for every American who wants them during a pandemic, it should invest in multiple types of vaccines instead of putting all of our eggs in one basket."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The cancellation comes even though Moderna says a study involving 300 healthy adults had produced "positive interim" results and the company "had previously expected to advance the program to late-stage development."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis of the Phase 1/2 study of our H5 avian flu vaccine and we will explore alternative paths forward for the program," Stéphane Bancel, Moderna's chief executive officer, said &lt;a href="https://www.accessnewswire.com/newsroom/en/healthcare-and-pharmaceutical/moderna-announces-update-on-investigational-pandemic-influenza-progra-1033069" target="_blank"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. "These clinical data in pandemic influenza underscore the critical role mRNA technology has played as a countermeasure to emerging health threats."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The administration's move drew sharp criticism from outside experts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This decision puts the lives and health of the American people at risk," said Dr. &lt;a href="https://dean.sph.brown.edu/dean" target="_blank"&gt;Ashish Jha&lt;/a&gt;, the dean of the Brown School of Public Health, who served as President Biden's COVID-19 response coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Bird Flu is a well known threat and the virus has continued to evolve. If the virus develops the ability to spread from person to person, we could see a large number of people get sick and die from this infection," Jha said. "The program to develop the next generation of vaccines was essential to protecting Americans. The attack by the Administration on the mRNA vaccine platform is absurd."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/michael-t-osterholm-phd-mph" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Osterholm&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota agreed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This decision will make our country far less prepared to respond to the next influenza pandemic," he said in an email. "This is a dangerous course to follow."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, the H5N1 flu virus has spread to 41 dairy herds, and 24 poultry farms and culling operations, and caused 70 human cases. While the virus has had a high mortality rate in other countries, so far H5N1 has only caused one death in the U.S. and has not shown any signs of spreading easily from one person to another. But infectious disease experts are concerned that the more the virus spreads, the greater the chance it could mutate into a form that would spread from person to person, which would increase the risk of a pandemic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the possibility of the cancellation had been anticipated — the new leadership at HHS told the company in February that &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/03/hhs-moderna-vaccine-contract-bird-flu-pandemic-preparedness-worries/"&gt;it was reviewing the contract&lt;/a&gt;, signed with the Biden administration — the move is being seen as a significant blow to the country’s capacity to respond to pandemic influenza.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;No other flu vaccine production approach can produce doses with the speed of the messenger RNA platform used by Moderna and other companies that work with mRNA. But the vaccine platform is viewed with deep suspicion by health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his political base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a diagnostic challenge, and doctors began reviewing the list of possibilities that could match his condition. The first guess of pneumonia could explain some of his respiratory findings, but he didn't have a cough, had tested negative for common respiratory pathogens, and the lung imaging didn't quite fit, making it seem unlikely. Blood cancers, such as polycythemia vera, might be able to explain the high concentrations of blood cells. And it might also make him more vulnerable to opportunistic lung infections, like a fungal infection that could explain the halo sign. But blood cancers were also deemed unlikely given that he didn't have enlarged organs, which is often seen with such conditions. Another possibility of pulmonary–renal syndrome, but that also didn't line up with the man's case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one other possibility that seemed to tick all the boxes: fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, low oxygen saturation, pulmonary edema, and shock—a hantavirus infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hantaviruses are RNA viruses that infect rodents worldwide. They typically cause asymptomatic, chronic infections in the animals, which spread the virus widely into their environments through their urine, feces, and saliva. Humans get infected when virus particles from rodent-contaminated areas are stirred up into the air and inhaled, or through direct contact with the virus via the eyes, nose, mouth, or cuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In humans, the viral infection is anything but asymptomatic. While &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457906001882?via%3Dihub"&gt;the disease mechanism&lt;/a&gt; isn't entirely understood, the virus appears to be able to modulate immune responses in humans, causing blood vessels and capillaries in various places in the body to start leaking plasma. This leads to fluid building up in the lungs (the pulmonary edema) and systemic circulatory collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cardiopulmonary hantavirus infection typically has four stages: the incubation period, which can last up to 45 days after virus exposure; a prodromal phase up to 12 days that are marked by fever, fatigue, and pains; the cardiopulmonary phase, where breathing trouble, low oxygen saturation, and shock can develop; then, if you make it, the fourth stage, in which respiratory symptoms improve, but there's lingering fatigue and the kidneys make abnormally large amounts of urine.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

Scientists studying mice found that individual neurons in the Substantia Nigra pars reticulata (SNr) switch dynamically between activation and inhibition based on the phase of a movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These SNr signals work like traffic lights, allowing complex behaviors to emerge from precisely timed combinations of “go” and “stop” instructions. The findings could reshape treatments for disorders like Parkinson’s, where this balance of movement control breaks down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Signaling:&lt;/strong&gt; SNr neurons dynamically increase or decrease activity depending on specific movement phases like reach, grasp, or retract.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traffic Light Model:&lt;/strong&gt; The basal ganglia output works like a fine-tuned traffic control system, licensing or blocking individual movements in real time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may lead to better treatments for movement disorders like Parkinson’s by targeting precise timing mechanisms in motor control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Basel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurons deep in the brain not only help to initiate movement—they also actively suppress it, and with astonishing precision. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the conclusion of a new study by researchers at the University of Basel and the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research (FMI), published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are especially relevant for better understanding neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110420"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This study focuses on the so-called Substantia Nigra pars reticulata (SNr), the main output station of the basal ganglia, which sends signals to motor centers in the brainstem. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reaching for an apple or bringing a spoon to the mouth—these seemingly simple actions rely on highly complex processes in the brain. A key player in this orchestration is a deep-seated brain region known as the basal ganglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a long time, the output signal of the basal ganglia was thought to function mainly as a brake, suppressing unwanted behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers led by Professor Silvia Arber have now shown in mice that specific neurons in the basal ganglia make highly precise decisions about when to allow and when to actively stop a specific movement. Together, these dynamic signals license the timing of movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basal ganglia: A central switchboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These insights challenge the long-standing model of how the basal ganglia work. According to the traditional view, the basal ganglia control movement by continuously inhibiting motor centers in the brain, only briefly “releasing the brake” when a movement is allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But this model falls far short in terms of complex movements, such as those involved in coordinated actions of the arms and hands,” explains Arber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study focuses on the so-called Substantia Nigra pars reticulata (SNr), the main output station of the basal ganglia, which sends signals to motor centers in the brainstem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers made a surprising discovery: the neurons in this region don’t merely fire to inhibit movement. Instead, they display highly dynamic activity patterns —precisely timed to the movements being executed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During complex behaviors, SNr neurons switch multiple times between increased and decreased activity, each neuron with its specific dynamic pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the output of the basal ganglia functions like a finely tuned system of traffic lights at a busy intersection: each light turns green or red for specific movements, depending on the action that is planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this way, complex behaviors can be built from individual movements, governed by the timing of these “go” and “stop” signals provided by SNr neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fine-grained movement control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate these processes, two of Arber’s doctoral students recorded brain activity in mice as these used their hands to reach for food pellets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that individual SNr neurons responded very differently depending on the movement phase: when the arm reached, the hand grasped, or was retracted, specific neurons increased their activity while others paused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s amazing how finely tuned these signals are,” Antonio Falasconi and Harsh Kanodia, the study’s lead authors, agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“SNr neurons only pause their activity during very specific movements and increase it during select others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using optogenetic techniques, the researchers then manipulated SNr neurons. They were able to show that activating these neurons blocked the behavior—a clear demonstration of their controlling role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most strikingly, even the slightest changes in movement were accompanied by precise adjustments in SNr signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downstream motor centers in the brainstem responded by sending signals back to the SNr. So when the SNr “traffic light” turned green, the downstream neuron essentially presses the gas pedal, allowing the execution of a movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This points to a highly specific, movement-based coding system—far more granular than just a general “go” or “stop” mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New avenues for treating movement disorders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study offers a vivid picture of how the brain controls even the subtlest movements through a fine-tuned interplay of activation and inhibition—reshaping our understanding of motor control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has important medical implications: in disorders like Parkinson’s or chorea, this delicate balance is disrupted, leading to hallmark symptoms such as difficulty initiating movement in Parkinson’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we understand how the basal ganglia coordinate normal movement, we can develop more targeted treatments when this system goes out of balance,” explains lead researcher Arber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d1b0bfb6b4bdb8bab0ffbbb0b2beb3a291a4bfb8b3b0a2ffb2b9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Angelika Jacobs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://unibas.ch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Basel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Angelika Jacobs – University of Basel&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09066-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dynamic basal ganglia output signals license and suppress forelimb movements&lt;/a&gt;” by Silvia Arber et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic basal ganglia output signals license and suppress forelimb movements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The basal ganglia are fundamental to motor control and their dysfunction is linked to motor deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Influential investigations on the primate oculomotor system posited that movement generally depends on transient pauses of tonically firing inhibitory basal ganglia output neurons releasing brainstem motor centres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, prominent increases in basal ganglia output neuron firing observed during other motor tasks cast doubts on the proposed mechanisms of movement regulation through basal ganglia circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show that basal ganglia output neurons in the mouse substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) represent complex forelimb movements with highly granular and dynamic changes in spiking activity, tiling task execution at the population level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single SNr neurons exhibit movement-specific firing pauses as well as increases, each occurring in concert with precise and different forelimb movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining optogenetics and simultaneous recordings from basal ganglia output and postsynaptic brainstem neurons, we reveal the functional role of these dynamic firing-rate changes in releasing and suppressing movement through downstream targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, our results demonstrate the existence and function of highly specific and temporally precise movement representations in basal ganglia output circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We propose a model in which basal ganglia output neurons fire dynamically to provide granular and bidirectional movement-specific signals for release and suppression of motor programs to downstream circuits.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 20:50:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5VQlRwV1VIVkwtc3U0bTNGQ05RZ0pJbkdhVHBUWU5JX3NrQlZjQlYza1ZYT2NraFJPc2p2MklneVBfdWRjcDllYmw1QWVtb2dqMWtrNmxtbWlpNWFaX0hIM0FpY0xEOFdhbF9PT0N3WENHeHM</guid></item><item><title>咖啡如何影响睡眠大脑- Medical Xpress | How coffee affects a sleeping brain - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE9RZjdaelJLQ1ZPTExrbWd5RVR4bHhnTktkaGtzeVN5aXdWak1ZU0I4dXlBTGphb1hEcUdxNDRuMkQ3a3NlRUd5bXIzQmpmeWV5SHFSM2w2Rm5kWm10QlEwcldGb05yYldTLWFmQWZzRWc3UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is not only found in coffee, but also in tea, chocolate, energy drinks and many soft drinks, making it one of the most widely consumed psychoactive substances in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In a study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-025-08090-z" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Communications Biology&lt;/i&gt;, a team of researchers from Université de Montréal shed new light on how caffeine can modify sleep and influence the brain's recovery—both physical and cognitive—overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was led by Philipp Thölke, a research trainee at UdeM's Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience Laboratory (CoCo Lab), and co-led by the lab's director, Karim Jerbi, a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/psychology+professor/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;psychology professor&lt;/a&gt; and researcher at Mila–Quebec AI Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with sleep-and-aging psychology professor Julie Carrier and her team at UdeM's Centre for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine, the scientists used AI and electroencephalography (EEG) to study caffeine's effect on sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They showed for the first time that caffeine increases the complexity of brain signals and enhances brain "criticality" during sleep. Interestingly, this was more pronounced in younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Criticality describes a state of the brain that is balanced between order and chaos," said Jerbi. "It's like an orchestra: too quiet and nothing happens, too chaotic and there's cacophony. Criticality is the happy medium where brain activity is both organized and flexible. In this state, the brain functions optimally: It can process information efficiently, adapt quickly, learn and make decisions with agility."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrier added, "Caffeine stimulates the brain and pushes it into a state of criticality, where it is more awake, alert and reactive. While this is useful during the day for concentration, this state could interfere with rest at night; the brain would neither relax nor recover properly."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;40 adults studied&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To study how caffeine affects the sleeping brain, Carrier's team recorded the nocturnal brain activity of 40 healthy adults using an electroencephalogram. They compared each participant's brain activity on two separate nights—one when they consumed caffeine capsules three hours and then one hour before bedtime, and another when they took a placebo at the same times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We used advanced statistical analysis and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/artificial+intelligence/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; to identify subtle changes in neuronal activity," said Thölke, the study's first author. "The results showed that caffeine increased the complexity of brain signals, reflecting more dynamic and less predictable neuronal activity, especially during the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) phase of sleep that's crucial for memory consolidation and cognitive recovery."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also discovered striking changes in the brain's electrical rhythms during sleep: Caffeine attenuated slower oscillations such as theta and alpha waves—generally associated with deep, restorative sleep—and stimulated beta wave activity, which is more common during wakefulness and mental engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These changes suggest that even during sleep, the brain remains in a more activated, less restorative state under the influence of caffeine," says Jerbi, who also holds the Canada Research Chair in Computational Neuroscience and Cognitive Neuroimaging. "This change in the brain's rhythmic activity may help explain why caffeine affects the efficiency with which the brain recovers during the night, with potential consequences for memory processing."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;People in their 20s more affected&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that the effects of caffeine on brain dynamics were significantly more pronounced in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/young+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;young adults&lt;/a&gt; between ages 20 and 27 compared to middle-aged participants aged 41 to 58, especially during REM sleep, the phase associated with dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young adults showed a greater response to caffeine, likely due to a higher density of adenosine receptors in their brains. Adenosine is a molecule that gradually accumulates in the brain throughout the day, causing a feeling of fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Adenosine receptors naturally decrease with age, reducing caffeine's ability to block them and improve brain complexity, which may partly explain the reduced effect of caffeine observed in middle-aged participants," Carrier said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These age-related differences suggest that younger brains may be more susceptible to the stimulant effects of caffeine. Given caffeine's widespread use around the world, especially as a daily remedy for fatigue, the researchers stress the importance of understanding its complex effects on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain activity&lt;/a&gt; across different age groups and health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They add that further research is needed to clarify how these neural changes affect cognitive health and daily functioning, and to potentially guide personalized recommendations for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/caffeine/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; intake.&lt;/p&gt;

The rush of heat, the pounding heart, and the urges to shout or slam a door feel almost automatic. Most of us just want lash out and vent, hoping the anger will be gone as fast as it came.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, people have sworn by “getting it out,” whether by screaming into a pillow or pummeling a punching bag. Others swear by the opposite approach: pause, breathe, let it pass. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new scientific sweep of the evidence puts these rival tactics head-to-head – and crowns a clear winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-venting-anger-myth-loses-steam"&gt;The ‘venting anger’ myth loses steam&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the second paragraph, it’s time to meet the researchers. Communication scholar &lt;a href="https://comm.osu.edu/people/bushman.20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brad Bushman&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://osu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt; has spent years testing the notion of catharsis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Venting anger might sound like a good idea, but it’s actually counterproductive,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His team, working with postdoctoral fellow &lt;a href="https://sophiekja.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sophie Kjærvik&lt;/a&gt;, combed through 154 different studies with more than 10,000 people to sort myth from reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their review shows that activities lowering bodily arousal – deep breathing, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mindfulness-protects-against-work-stress-burnout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mindfulness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/meditation-slows-biological-aging-at-the-molecular-level/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;meditation&lt;/a&gt;, even slow, controlled yoga – consistently push anger levels down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The setting hardly matters; results hold for solo exercises at home, therapist-guided sessions, and app-based programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reducing arousal – and actually the physiological aspect of it – is really important,” Kjærvik explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-numbers-say"&gt;What the numbers say&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kjærvik’s meta-analysis, published in &lt;em&gt;Clinical Psychology Review&lt;/em&gt;, found that every group studied – college students, retirees, people with intellectual disabilities, and individuals with criminal records – benefited from arousal-decreasing strategies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast, jogging, hitting a bag, or smashing plates in a rage room showed little effect or even nudged anger upward. “To reduce anger, it is better to engage in activities that decrease arousal levels,” Bushman notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta-analyses of this size are rare in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-shows-better-emotional-intelligence-than-humans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;emotion research&lt;/a&gt;. By pooling so many participants, the team could spot small but steady patterns that single experiments miss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consistency across gender, age, and cultural background signals that calming the body is a universal recipe, not a fad tied to one social-media trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-calm-beats-cardio"&gt;Calm beats cardio&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why would a brisk run fail where a quiet breath succeeds? Anger already revs the sympathetic nervous system – the body’s gas pedal. Adding more acceleration simply keeps the engine roaring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Certain physical activities that increase arousal may be good for your heart, but they’re definitely not the best way to reduce anger,” Bushman adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/yoga-can-reduce-stress-and-improve-brain-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Yoga&lt;/a&gt; offers an intriguing twist. Though poses raise heart rate, the practice embeds steady breathing and focused attention, turning movement into meditation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was really interesting to see that progressive muscle relaxation and relaxation in general might be as effective as approaches such as mindfulness and meditation,” Kjærvik noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And yoga, which can be more arousing than meditation and mindfulness, is still a way of calming and focusing on your breath that has a similar effect in reducing anger.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inside-the-body-s-alarm-system"&gt;Inside the body’s alarm system&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anger sparks a full-body alert: faster heartbeat, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-from-plastic-bottles-linked-to-high-blood-pressure-and-heart-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;higher blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, surging adrenaline. The sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system primes muscles for fight or flight, while its calmer twin – the parasympathetic branch – waits to dial everything back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Techniques that lengthen exhales or tense and release muscles flip that switch sooner, cooling the system before words or fists fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists think this quick reset evolved because it lets social groups resolve conflicts without lasting harm. Lowering arousal gives the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-brain-pathways-identified-as-being-unique-to-humans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt; – our planning center – time to weigh consequences, recall past regrets, and choose words more carefully. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The payoff is fewer broken dishes, lower stress hormones, and relationships that bounce back instead of break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reducing-anger-without-venting"&gt;Reducing anger without venting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apps offering guided breathing now sit within arm’s reach, many of them free of charge. A simple routine – inhale for four counts, exhale for six – can drop heart rate within a minute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two cycles of progressive muscle relaxation ease shoulder knots that broadcast irritability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A five-minute mindfulness session on YouTube can do the same job as a longer appointment when time is tight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really a battle because angry people want to vent, but our research shows that any good feeling we get from venting actually reinforces aggression,” Bushman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For situations demanding movement, try a slow walk around the block. Keep the pace easy enough to hold a steady conversation. Pair it with attention to your surroundings – the hum of cicadas, the scent of fresh-cut grass. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gentle motion helps metabolize &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stress-hormones-rise-during-sleep-to-prepare-your-body-for-the-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stress hormones&lt;/a&gt; without driving arousal higher, and nature’s small details pull focus away from rumination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-does-any-of-this-matter"&gt;Why does any of this matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unchecked anger strains marriages, work teams, and the cardiovascular system. Over months, it can hardwire aggressive habits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new review shows there’s nothing inevitable about that spiral; swapping venting for calming returns control to the driver’s seat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because most interventions cost little or nothing, workplaces, prisons, and schools can roll them out without red tape. Even a coach’s whistle can cue athletes to pause for three slow breaths before play resumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents can apply the same thinking at home. Instead of sending a child to “go punch a pillow,” suggest three balloon-slow breaths, a sip of water, and a quiet corner until color fades from their cheeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modeling the strategy yourself teaches by example and keeps the living room peaceful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooling down trumps blowing up. Evidence from more than 10,000 volunteers says so, and the message holds whether you are nine or ninety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So next time fury rises, skip the punching bag and breathe. Your heart – and everyone within earshot – will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735824000357?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Clinical Psychology Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 20:03:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxOTERJMGpmZE9UNi1ZeVJRcDFic0xZMVlkenJKVnBJWVpQMVlfMU11cXV4bzQ5V0paemprSUU4N3NBWXlUYTNKb2hva294MEpIMlBiVkcxZ0M5dEFfVTRIZ3M1QjJPcGxHOGo4bldKamJqSDgtdS1mVktPMnNsZzlNVmdjUkJTaFgxVXNqaGNRSW1KZ3Z4MTBRNVQzVzN1Zw</guid></item><item><title>Lilly Jay博士从未要求成为焦点，但她已经准备好发声了- glamour.com | Dr. Lilly Jay Never Asked for the Spotlight—But She’s Ready to Speak Up - glamour.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOOTdINXg5S3Q4alhPQVJ6eWRrQmhLd3RjcTBMenhRR01FZmtwR2kyYVhGY0JrZGNDZ0xIYzZRU2Y4bjYwLVhGSlYtVHpkc3RsNnRBa1R5ZEs2NmotR2QwejJDMS1vV21kdkVqREE3elFtcXU3U2dKcXRUTnNabjUwSlpKTG1aTXptZG9od2NZa1JxY1JkRzBVWGRRSjY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the moment, she thinks, to use her public voice for good. So Dr. Jay has decided to join the medical board of a science-backed parenting platform, Riley, in order to help bring its suite of mental-health support resources to more parents nationwide. The app, which was previously only available in beta mode via a waitlist, is open to the public as of Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amanda DeLuca founded &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.rileyapp.com/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22532269371&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAA90kCE5lfe1wk648TtLkSXQx0v7hw&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw6NrBBhB6EiwAvnT_rtmYi_J37NjbkVg75D_sB3oMxg15nol3QMpqVvL8ngHkA5c8w8uu4RoCoLEQAvD_BwE" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.rileyapp.com/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22532269371&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAA90kCE5lfe1wk648TtLkSXQx0v7hw&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw6NrBBhB6EiwAvnT_rtmYi_J37NjbkVg75D_sB3oMxg15nol3QMpqVvL8ngHkA5c8w8uu4RoCoLEQAvD_BwE"}' href="https://www.rileyapp.com/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22532269371&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAA90kCE5lfe1wk648TtLkSXQx0v7hw&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw6NrBBhB6EiwAvnT_rtmYi_J37NjbkVg75D_sB3oMxg15nol3QMpqVvL8ngHkA5c8w8uu4RoCoLEQAvD_BwE" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Riley&lt;/a&gt; in November 2023 after her own experience with postpartum depression. When DeLuca, a former Etsy and NerdWallet product lead, was in the throes of her mental-health struggle following the 2022 birth of her daughter, she recalls spending hours doomscrolling the internet, simmering in her myriad anxieties of what could happen to her baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not an uncommon experience—many moms admit spending way too much time googling their fears plus using Reddit, then spiraling down a rabbit hole of toxicity that makes their condition worse, not better. What Riley aims to do, DeLuca tells me, is provide a science-based, all-in-one parental advisory platform to provide support that reduces the mental load of constant optimization and worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What you should be getting out of using the app is just more joyful time with your children and feeling more confident, making good decisions, and spending quality time with them,” DeLuca tells me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, more plainly, helping parents to put down their phones. It’s one of the things that Dr. Jay sees in her practice that she wants to help alleviate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a clinician, I hear so many patients contend with the constant work of trying to sort through the entire internet’s worth of knowledge about parenting,” she says. “Then they get to a point where they’re too exhausted to do anything with the information, and they’ve also lost a lot of time and either maintained or amplified their own anxieties in the constant searching. Getting a good clear answer that you can do something with, and is in conversation with whatever you are still tracking about your baby, frees you up to get back to the important work that will never be replaced by an app, which is parenting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking publicly about these issues, Dr. Jay thinks, is a first step to determining what this next phase of her life will look like. She grows most passionate when speaking about the myriad of crises facing her patients and American mothers at large, noting that our country currently has “maternal mortality and morbidity rates, especially for women of color, that are unconscionable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with all of her resources and privilege, Jay says, when she gave birth to her son she was not always believed when she talked about what she was experiencing in her own body. In the hospital, she repeatedly told her medical team that she felt something was wrong, only to be told she simply had a headache from the dry hospital air. She actually had preeclampsia, a dangerous and serious pregnancy complication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Dr. Jay, something needs to change, starting with making our health care system “more responsive to the full complexity of pregnancy.” It will not only make women safer; it will also make them better mothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>glamour.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 19:07:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOOTdINXg5S3Q4alhPQVJ6eWRrQmhLd3RjcTBMenhRR01FZmtwR2kyYVhGY0JrZGNDZ0xIYzZRU2Y4bjYwLVhGSlYtVHpkc3RsNnRBa1R5ZEs2NmotR2QwejJDMS1vV21kdkVqREE3elFtcXU3U2dKcXRUTnNabjUwSlpKTG1aTXptZG9od2NZa1JxY1JkRzBVWGRRSjY</guid></item><item><title>健康回报： RFK Jr.的新冠疫苗建议变更可能威胁健康，获取- CNBC | Healthy Returns: RFK Jr.’s Covid vaccine recommendation change could threaten health, access - CNBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOQmZoLXFzZHpzZXprSlMtNHg4cllhbmFpMFZjZmdYdTc0Rml5dTZhWWFlT1BxWU5kMjhEd1A3T0dnTTdxSnlseDg5OFpZMEVjUHB3TVF3bDk4SHBVSHJxckpEZXJKVTRhcnlndHJOM0NnUUdwbXY2Mm1WeTVmTHZ3NE9aeFBuLV9Pa2RxTWY2dWFfVVZ3SHg2U0dTalHSAaIBQVVfeXFMUG1iZWNyRnFxVUFBRllJUjB5dnphbVdZMFkzREc0TWc3Z3FieXBoRkUwX0pIMDkyX0lvd2ViWUMtNWMzX1dVNWd2cmVSaG1wamVIRC13am5vdVNacGZfSG9vUEx4VnJ1WEszVDJWMmtrZUxXVklMejFlNlhrRWExVHc4cEx2YTJXaTc1SHhUY1JLSE9PbmQ3cjg1bGtnWnhBUEJR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleBody-articleBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-ArticleBody-6" data-module="ArticleBody" data-test="articleBody-2" data-analytics="SpecialReportArticle-articleBody-6-2"&gt;&lt;span class="HighlightShare-hidden"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this article first appeared in CNBC's Healthy Returns newsletter, which brings the latest health-care news straight to your inbox. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/healthy-returns-newsletter/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to receive future editions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wave of outrage is sweeping the scientific and medical world after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s decision to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/27/cdc-ends-covid-vaccine-recommendation-for-healthy-kids-and-pregnant-women.html"&gt;stop recommending routine Covid-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for healthy children and healthy pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic, on Tuesday said the Covid shot has been removed from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommended immunization schedule for those groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Last year, the Biden administration urged healthy children to get yet another Covid shot, despite the lack of any clinical data to support the repeat booster strategy in children," Kennedy said in a &lt;a href="https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1927368440811008138?s=46" target="_blank"&gt;video &lt;/a&gt;on X. He offered no scientific evidence to justify the change to the recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's Kennedy's latest move to change and potentially undermine vaccinations in the U.S. since he took the helm at the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the federal agencies that regulate and recommend shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes a week after Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/20/fda-stricter-covid-vaccine-approval.html"&gt;set stricter standards&lt;/a&gt; for approving shots for healthy Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some health experts say the dropped recommendation could have devastating consequences, particularly for pregnant women and their babies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both are considered to be at &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/risk-factors/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;higher risk of severe &lt;/a&gt;complications from Covid-19 infections, according to the CDC's website. That can include&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/pregnancy-and-covid-19/art-20482639#:~:text=Pregnant%20people%20with%20severe%20COVID,high%20blood%20pressure%20or%20preeclampsia." target="_blank"&gt; preterm labor and birth&lt;/a&gt;, heart injury, blood clots and kidney damage among pregnant women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As ob-gyns who treat patients every day, we have seen firsthand how dangerous COVID-19 infection can be during pregnancy and for newborns who depend on maternal antibodies from the vaccine for protection," Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He emphasized that "the science has not changed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Following this announcement, we are worried about our patients in the future, who may be less likely to choose vaccination during pregnancy despite the clear and definitive evidence demonstrating its benefit," Fleischman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7338a1.htm#:~:text=Maternal%20vaccination%20during%20pregnancy%20has%20been%20shown,months%2C%20including%20those%20who%20are%20pregnant%20(8%2C9)" target="_blank"&gt;Studies have found&lt;/a&gt; that Covid-19 vaccination reduces the risk of hospitalization from the virus for pregnant women and infants younger than 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fleischman and other experts also raised concerns about whether patients will have access to vaccines following Kennedy's decision. The CDC's recommendation is crucial because it guides insurance plans on which shots to cover at no cost to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medicare and Medicaid require that the recommended vaccines are free for patients. The Affordable Care Act requires private insurers to cover all vaccines recommended by the CDC's outside committee of vaccine advisors and director.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Children without insurance can get free recommended vaccines through the government-run Vaccines for Children Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-8"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/PFE/"&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-9"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/MRNA/"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are charging up to $150 per dose for their respective Covid shots before insurance, according to the CDC's &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/php/awardees/current-cdc-vaccine-price-list.html" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This decision could make it significantly harder for millions of Americans to access vaccines they want for themselves and their families," Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/news--publications-new/articles/2025/new-covid-vaccine-recommendations-threaten-access-undermine-choice-and-will-negatively-impact-health/" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tan added that process for Kennedy's decision breaks with the precedent of letting federal panels of experts publicly debate scientific evidence and vote on immunization practices. A group of external advisors to the CDC typically gives vaccine advice to the agency's director. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump's nominee to lead the CDC, acting director Susan Monarez, still needs Senate confirmation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This decision bypasses a long-established, evidence-based process used to ensure vaccine safety and ignores the expertise of independent medical experts, including members of CDC committees who are examining the evidence regarding the vaccine to make recommendations for the fall," Sean O'Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/05/acog-statement-on-hhs-recommendations-regarding-the-covid-vaccine-during-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that the decision could "strip families of choice," preventing those who want to vaccinate from getting shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at &lt;a href="http://nbcuni.com/?__source=newsletter%7Chealthyreturns" target="_blank"&gt;annikakim.constantino@nbcuni.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Latest in health-care tech: Hinge Health makes its debut on the New York Stock Exchange &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108149556" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;Hinge Health Inc. signage on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) during the company's initial public offering (IPO) in New York, US, on Thursday, May 22, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you hear that? That was the sound of the digital health sector breathing a collective sigh of relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital physical therapy company &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-14"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/HNGE/"&gt;Hinge Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; debuted on the New York Stock Exchange last week &lt;strong&gt;in &lt;/strong&gt;the sector's first major public exit in several years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broader tech IPO market has been in a drought since late 2021, when soaring inflation and rising interest rates pushed investors out of risky assets. And within digital health, there's been practically no IPO activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hinge, founded in 2014, uses software to help patients treat acute musculoskeletal injuries and chronic pain, as well as carry out post-surgery rehabilitation remotely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock opened at $39.25 on Thursday, rising 23% from its $32 IPO price. It closed up 17% at $37.56 a share, bringing its market capitalization to more than $3 billion. As of Wednesday afternoon, shares are trading at more than $41. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to its IPO, Hinge had raised more than $1 billion from investors including Insight Partners, Atomico, Tiger Global Management and Coatue Management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most analysts will officially kick off coverage of the stock around 30 days after its debut. But analysts at Roth shared some initial thoughts about Hinge earlier this month, before it went public. Importantly, they did not participate in the offering, make a recommendation or initiate coverage in their report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We watched HNGE's IPO roadshow presentation and were impressed by the AI products underpinning the platform and rate of care expansion," including beyond musculoskeletal conditions, the analysts said in a note on May 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hinge said that revenue in its first quarter climbed 50% to $123.8 million, up from $82.7 million during the same period last year. The company reported $117.3 million in revenue during its fourth quarter, up 44% from the same period in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Roth analysts said the company's recent fundamentals are encouraging, including its accelerating revenues and billings as well as its improved operating margins. Some of the risks facing the company include the competitive digital therapy landscape, its reliance on peer-reviewed data and regulatory overhang, they said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Hinge's debut, another digital health company is preparing to join the fray.

In Connecticut, rabies is usually carried by skunks, raccoons, and bats but any mammal could carry the disease. The Department wants to remind residents to protect themselves and their pets from contact with these wild animals.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more from the Meriden Department of Health and Human Services below:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are simple precautions that you can take:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vaccinate your pets. Be sure your pet dogs, cats, ferrets and other animals are up-to-date on their rabies vaccinations. Pets too young to be vaccinated should be kept indoors and allowed outside only under direct observation. Your veterinarian can let you know if your pet is too young to be vaccinated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep family pets indoors at night. Don’t leave them outside unattended or let them roam free.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t attract wild animals into your home or yard. Keep your property free of stored bird seed or other foods that may attract wild animals. Feed pets indoors. Tightly cap or put away garbage cans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t feed, touch or adopt wild animals, stray dogs or cats. Enjoy wildlife from a distance. If you see that an animal is sick, injured or orphaned, call Animal Control (203-235-4179). Do not handle the animal yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get wild animals removed from your home. If nuisance wild animals are living in parts of your home, consult with a nuisance wildlife control expert about having them removed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teach children not to touch any animal they do not know and to tell an adult immediately if they are bitten by any animal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Let wild animals wander away if they are on your property. Bring children and pets indoors and alert neighbors who are outside.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Report all animal bites or contact with wild animals to your local health department. If possible, do not let any animal escape that has possibly exposed someone to rabies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more information about rabies in both humans and animals, visit the Center for Disease Control and Prevention at &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/rabies" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;www.cdc.gov/rabies&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sardines also offer &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/selenium-8689983" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;selenium&lt;/a&gt;, a trace mineral that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/antioxidants-7969374" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;functions as a powerful antioxidant&lt;/a&gt;, said Routhenstein.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You don’t need to eat sardines every day to benefit your heart. Eating one can is more than the 1.1 g daily minimum recommended for general health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

"Sardines also contain purines, which should be considered by those prone to &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/fish-and-gout-5093098" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;gout&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If the idea of popping open a can of sardines makes you squeamish, don’t worry—Routhenstein says they’re surprisingly easy to work into meals, such as:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Serve on toast or crackers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snacks with a punch&lt;/strong&gt;: Pair sardines with avocado and seaweed for a nutrient-packed snack.&lt;/li&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;COVID-19 cases are rising again as a new variant begins to circulate in some parts of the world. The World Health Organization said Wednesday the rise in cases is primarily in the eastern Mediterranean, Southeast Asia and western Pacific regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airport screening in the United States has detected the new variant in travelers arriving from those regions to destinations in California, Washington state, Virginia and New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new variant is called NB.1.8.1. It arrives as the United States’ official stance on COVID-19 vaccination is changing. On Tuesday, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that COVID-19 shots are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women — a move immediately questioned by several public health experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/kennedy-says-government-no-longer-recommends-covid-vaccines-for-healthy-children-and-pregnant-women"&gt;Kennedy says government no longer recommends COVID vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new variant, increasing globally, had by mid-May reached nearly 11% of sequenced samples reported. The WHO has designated it a “variant under monitoring” and considers the public health risk low at the global level with current vaccines expected to remain effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WHO said some western Pacific countries have reported increases in COVID cases and hospitalizations, but there’s nothing so far to suggest that the disease associated with the new variant is more severe compared to other variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variant called LP.8.1 is currently the dominant version in the U.S. and globally.&lt;/p&gt;

"What we know is that when a virus is more transmissible, it will ultimately infect more people and when you infect more people ... you'll have more cases of severe illness, hospitalization, and unfortunately death. "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Data from China and elsewhere doesn't seem to show anything unique about the variant other than increased transmissibility, Brownstein added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Some of the variant's mutations found on the surface proteins of the virus could increase its transmissibility and potentially make it somewhat harder to treat compared to current variants in wide circulation, according to the WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Approved COVID-19 vaccines are expected to remain effective against this variant, according to the WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"This is the natural path we've seen with every variant, and so the guidance doesn't really change at the end of the day," Brownstein said. "It's making sure people are up to date with their vaccines and boosters ... and then of course, those that are immunocompromised or in high-risk groups may want to layer in other types of interventions like masking or being careful about large group settings where there could be increased risk of transmission."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Niki Iranpour, MD, is an internal medicine resident at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 17:32:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxOOXBJWGFZSGk0OGRSYWVWMUdNWjFQejUxenFJaE9YZjJJd1ZCVTM0XzhfN21vUFZVY3EwX2hsN01mc2NjQzlLZmx3NzBUQ2hNSEMwcFF3M1ViV29kdmFYY2gyWVZRcnEwaTJTZlZURlZiS0N2bzI2WFpFb1FqaU9HTXBjMUo5Q1V2QUVSaW9lNE90UGF1ZzZUbNIBngFBVV95cUxQalFZLV91OEdHSGZRUDF3QUZsMGhTbHBfV3lianRxLTFlMlROVjcwVnRzemN4MTY2bFdIRWljN3NlY3FKVEZuaUozaDVzaUQ1Nk12U2Fqd1M1ZndRRVctVWZaQ0dRcmkzekptVGdQektQdUluNHN0Nk5HSkZHaVJ0cjdreEt1Rm16d0pJcUNRQkNCTnZ2bm1pX0NiTWZfZw</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心削减后，医生担心女性将无法获得避孕研究- NPR | After CDC cuts, doctors fear women will lose access to contraception research - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi4gFBVV95cUxOSzFhNFQxSkUtc0FYanpRQWJOR2FHcnJmMU82bUdNWEV6dTRlVkJhQ3ZReGhRZG1YR044WXE3bk80VWdoSkF2Rk9mbVRTaVF0azdxWk5fZGstN25aYlFvS2xhbDFzUmhUVWtKSHp1b01Ub3k3QW8zV3hlSlc0YlRkaVNNOU4xbUdNNU9nU08xWkRTeHZZZVUwUTZDaUZGTVg1MHQyZnRYVWlDTE1yNHZUYWwxZVM2X1hvMnJrc1ZTem91Yk1HSFg1bVRIU1ZPWHBiUFhTS2YyVjBVUlNlX1UxZWN3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;To most people, the eight-person team was indistinguishable from the hundreds of other scientists and researchers cut in April during the mass firings at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But for many clinicians who specialize in women's health, losing the team responsible for the CDC's contraception guidelines was a devastating&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/24/nx-s1-5376473/hhs-restores-funding-for-womens-health-initiative" target="_blank"&gt; blow to women's health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;" I just remember feeling like — of all the things — I think contraception shouldn't be controversial," says Dr. Angeline Ti, a family physician in the Atlanta, Georgia area who specializes in reproductive healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team was responsible for aggregating and disseminating best practices around contraception in a set of guidelines called &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/contraception/hcp/usmec/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I knew that things were gonna happen at CDC, but I thought that these guidelines were so important," says Ti. She says she uses the guidelines "pretty much every time" she sees a patient for contraceptive care. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Other doctors describe feeling equally shocked. "I mean, there is no other resource that is doing this," says Dr. Andrea Braden, an obstetrician in Atlanta, Georgia. "All the OB-GYN's use it."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Representatives from the Department of Health and Human Services and the Trump administration did not explain why the CDC team was cut. It was eliminated in April as part of the reduction of the Women's Health and Fertility Branch of the Division of Reproductive Health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR reached out to HHS for comment on this story, but did not receive a response.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; An indispensable app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Busy doctors who are seeing many patients, says Braden, simply do not have time to comb through all the latest medical research. So, the CDC team made recommendations available &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/contraception/hcp/contraceptive-guidance/app.html" target="_blank"&gt;in an app &lt;/a&gt;that doctors could download and easily reference with questions about contraception, including how to navigate the topic for patients with specific conditions and diseases. It was downloaded &lt;a href="https://www.nationalfamilyplanning.org/file/2024-national-conference/DRH_Nguyen_SL_NFPRHA-2024---clean.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;440,000 times&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The app was just a game changer for us," says Braden. "That was very clearly organized, really easy to digest, and it was such a nice quick reference for us. It was a resource that we all trusted intuitively."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The current guidelines are still accessible, while the team charged with updating them no longer exists.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Doctors caution that even though the recommendations were issued relatively recently, without careful monitoring they will soon be out of date. " Medicine is not static," says Dr. Deva Sharma, a hematologist who said the guidelines are a critical part of her medical practice. "It's constantly evolving and improving."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team issued guidelines most recently in 2024. One example of a change that Braden says had a significant impact on her conversations with her patients is around recommendations for breastfeeding mothers using birth control. The new guidelines for the first time acknowledged that some contraception can jeopardize milk supply in nursing mothers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This update, she says, represented a sea change in a way of thinking about the importance of empowering patients to make their own decisions about breastfeeding. " That was such an important aspect of the update," says Braden. "It helped us guide our practice, rather than tell people what they need after they have a baby. It really put the patient at the center of the conversation."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For some patients and doctors dealing with specific conditions, conversations about contraception can be matters of life or death. Sharma specializes in treating women with Sickle Cell disease — an inherited red blood cell disorder — which puts patients at a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2800895#:~:text=The%20maternal%20mortality%20rate%20in,%3B%2095%25%20CI%2C%200.5%2D" target="_blank"&gt;much greater risk &lt;/a&gt;of life threatening complications in pregnancy than people without the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sharma calls the termination of the CDC team "detrimental to women's health," and also recalls vividly the moment she found out when a colleague sent her a message. "I remember just feeling overwhelmed and devastated," says Sharma.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the recent guidelines, the CDC team changed recommendations for women with Sickle Cell Disease, which already puts patients at increased risk for blood clots. Doctors who treat this disease say they now rarely prescribe certain forms of contraception to their patients due to new evidence suggesting these kinds of treatments can create an even greater risk.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Braden says she is still feeling confused as to why such a valuable resource was eliminated. " I don't understand," she says "Why them? Why this sector of medicine? This is a waste."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She warns that doctors will not be able to compensate for the medical updates that this guide provides. " Medicine changes so quickly and it is very difficult to keep up with all of it," she warns. "New data comes out — new research comes out — and we find out that there's a better way to do things. Contraceptive medicine is no different from that."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missing treatment options are hard to measure &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many patients will not necessarily know about medical updates they do not benefit from, but Teonna Woolford is one patient who does understand the utility of the CDC's guidelines around contraception.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Born with&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/12/05/1129125408/for-patients-with-sickle-cell-disease-fertility-care-is-about-reproductive-justi" target="_blank"&gt; Sickle Cell Disease,&lt;/a&gt; Woolford started a non-profit, &lt;a href="https://sicklecellred.org/meet-our-team/" target="_blank"&gt;Sickle Cell Reproductive Education Directive&lt;/a&gt;, that advocates for patients like herself. Woolford says the disease is often characterized by uncertainty and difficulty in making hard decisions around treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Having the guidelines was really like a proactive approach to addressing contraception," says Woolford. "There are a lot of knowledge and research gaps on this subject."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sickle Cell Disease disproportionately affects people of color, a group that Woolford notes has not historically enjoyed parity in reproductive justice. "The removal of the CDC team to me just &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/05/1186019422/the-black-maternal-mortality-crisis-and-why-it-remains-an-issue" target="_blank"&gt;reminds me of darker times&lt;/a&gt; in our history when people of color were oppressed," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Black women in the United States have disproportionately &lt;a href="https://policycentermmh.org/maternal-mortality-in-the-u-s-a-declining-trend-with-persistent-racial-disparities-in-the-black-population/#:~:text=Disparities%20widen%20for%20Black%20Women:%20Black%20women,than%20Hispanic%20(12.4)%20and%20Asian%20(10.7)%20women.&amp;amp;text=Black%20women%20had%2050%20deaths%20for%20every,2023%2C%20up%20slightly%20from%2049.5%20in%202022." target="_blank"&gt;high rates of maternal mortality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Braden sees the team's elimination as a setback to women everywhere. "It really hurts those of us in women's health — to target something like contraceptives." says Braden. "This is basic healthcare for OBGYNs and it was really defeating. I would say I felt angry and sad and confused."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;She and other doctors point out that many women in the U.S. can no longer legally terminate pregnancy. They say that makes it especially important for them to be able to make an informed choice about the best ways to prevent becoming pregnant in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;" Bodily autonomy has been taken away from women in various states," says Dr. Sharma, who practices in Tennessee — a state &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/04/1242721479/how-narrow-can-a-medical-exception-be-in-a-state-s-abortion-ban" target="_blank"&gt;with strict abortion laws. &lt;/a&gt;"We've slashed people's rights to make decisions," she says.

and long-term impact on our body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;A recent video from simulation pro Zack D Films has seemingly worked to put some people off, as showed the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/ozempic-aftermath-side-effects-warning-doctors-fasting-uk-123012-20250525"&gt;brutal way&lt;/a&gt; in which the drug works to reduce fat in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Once &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/ozempic"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; is in your bloodstream, it activates the parts of the brain that make you feel full, reducing your appetite," he said in the clip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"It also stabilises your blood sugar, stopping sudden cravings. Then it slows down how fast your stomach empties food, which keeps you feeling full for longer after a meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"This causes you to lose weight as you eat less. But it can make some people feel sick and even give them diarrhoea."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Ozempic has become a controversial way for people to lose weight (Getty Stock)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;And now, a doctor has given yet another reason why those looking to lose weight should stick to more common methods, rather than turning to Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;In a &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/youtube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; short, Dr Boz, a doctor and content creator with close to one million followers &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ygdxz057KM0"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: "Ozempic should not be allowed for weight loss. Mark my words, put them in a time capsule and open it in 15 years. Ozempic has a remarkable weight loss but what they didn't focus on is that when these people are losing weight, they are losing muscle mass at a way higher rate than they should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"As you play this forward, especially in elder patients, when you lose that much muscle mass, you cannot gain it back without extreme measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"The chemistry behind how they are losing that weight is really a starvation weight loss. This is the kind of weight loss that will decrease their immune system, decrease their muscle mass, decrease their bone density and decrease their longevity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;So, if you're planning on taking Ozempic to lose weight, be wary that you might be doing some significant long-term damage which involves losing muscle mass as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Novo Nordisk, Ozempic's manufacturer, told LADbible Group: "Wegovy®▼ (semaglutide injection) and Ozempic® (semaglutide injection) are prescription only medicines and require a healthcare professional to prescribe under strict supervision. Treatment decisions should be made together with a healthcare provider who can evaluate the appropriateness of using a GLP-1 based on assessment of a patient’s individual medical profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Patient safety is of the utmost importance to Novo Nordisk. We continuously collect safety data on our marketed GLP-1 RA medicines and work closely with the authorities to ensure patient safety. As part of this work we continue to monitor reports of adverse drug reactions through routine pharmacovigilance. Regarding safety, the most common adverse events among people treated with Ozempic® (semaglutide injection) for its indicated use, are gastrointestinal events including nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium is a necessary mineral for many bodily processes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Too much sodium increases the risk of heart disease and high blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many canned foods, like beans and beets, can still be eaten—even when watching your sodium.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Are you trying to watch your sodium intake? Most people take in far too much, and excessive consumption can increase their risk of heart disease and high blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And keeping sodium intake in check is even more important for those who already have high blood pressure, which is nearly half of the adult population in the U.S.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have high blood pressure, canned goods are likely on your do-not-eat list because of their bad reputation for being high in sodium. In fact, canned soups are one of the “salty six:” popular foods identified by the American Heart Association as culprits for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-do-if-you-ate-too-much-sodium-last-night-8770796" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;excess dietary sodium intake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But before you write off canned goods for good—and miss out on a host of nutrient-dense and convenient staples—we’re here to reassure you that they can still be a part of a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7834741/healthy-high-blood-pressure-meal-plan-for-beginners/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;blood pressure-friendly diet&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adopting the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938379/the-1-diet-to-lower-high-blood-pressure-according-to-science/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to be a solid strategy for preventing and treating high blood pressure. A pillar of the DASH diet is to limit dietary sodium to no more than 2,300 milligrams per day, which is 1 teaspoon of salt. Canned foods can be quite high in sodium, so look for low-sodium or no-salt-added options. Draining and rinsing canned foods can also reduce sodium by up to 40%.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, like many diets, the DASH diet emphasizes the importance of fruits and vegetables. But here’s one thing: It doesn’t specify that they must be fresh. Canned produce is still packed with the same heart-healthy nutrients. The same goes for high-quality canned proteins like fish and legumes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In this article, we’ll review what to look for on canned food labels when shopping and the top canned foods for high blood pressure recommended by dietitians. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-canned-sardines"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Canned Sardines &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Canned sardines are packed with omega-3 fatty acids and calcium, both beneficial for blood pressure. Omega 3s help lower blood pressure by reducing inflammation, and calcium is an important mineral in the DASH diet, an eating pattern designed to lower blood pressure,” says &lt;a href="https://www.veronicarouse.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Veronica Rouse, M.A.N., RD, CDE&lt;/a&gt;, owner of The Heart Dietitian.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just one (5-ounce) can of sardines provides a significant amount of heart-healthy omega-3s, along with 18 grams of protein and 20% to 25% of the Daily Value for calcium, which is 1,300 mg.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Not sure how to use canned sardines? Try them in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250047/greek-salad-with-sardines/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Greek Salad with Sardines&lt;/a&gt;. Since sardines can be high in sodium, we recommend enjoying 1 cup of this salad instead of the recommended serving size, which is 2 cups. Or buy no-salt-added sardines and enjoy the full serving size.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s a lot to love about a humble can of beans, as it's a versatile pantry staple that is budget-friendly, convenient and nutrient-dense. “Eating canned beans is a great way to help keep your blood pressure in line,” says &lt;a href="https://www.lauramali.com/laura-ali-registered-dietitian-nutritionist/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Laura M. Ali, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a culinary nutritionist based in Pittsburgh, and author of the cookbook &lt;em&gt;MIND Diet for Two&lt;/em&gt;. “They are a good source of potassium, magnesium and fiber—nutrients that are important for blood pressure control. You can find a variety of low-sodium options, too.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Studies have linked higher intakes of legumes (like beans) with lower blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Just a half-cup of low-sodium canned black beans provides a whopping 8 grams of fiber, 7 grams of protein, and blood pressure-lowering micronutrients like calcium and potassium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; More specifically, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/calcium-benefits-8649279" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;calcium plays a crucial role&lt;/a&gt; in controlling blood flow by regulating the narrowing and widening of blood vessels. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Choosing the low-sodium option provides about half the sodium of a typical can of black beans.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Enjoy this beautiful &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/one-pot-white-bean-spinach-sun-dried-tomato-orzo-with-lemon-feta-8415910" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;One-Pot White Bean, Spinach &amp;amp; Sun-Dried Tomato Orzo with Lemon &amp;amp; Feta&lt;/a&gt; while helping to protect your heart.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned tomatoes are a versatile pantry staple that can be used in many dishes, from pasta to soup and sauces. They are also loaded with heart-healthy benefits. A half-cup serving of canned crushed tomatoes with no added salt is not only low in sodium but also provides 10% of the Daily Value for potassium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potassium helps counteract the effects of sodium by promoting its elimination through urine and by relaxing blood vessel walls. Additionally, canned tomatoes are rich in lycopene, a heart-healthy antioxidant that can help prevent cardiovascular disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For a delicious, heart-healthy dinner using canned tomatoes, make this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250239/tomato-soup/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Tomato Soup&lt;/a&gt; (serve it with our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7964556/spinach-artichoke-dip-grilled-cheese/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Spinach &amp;amp; Artichoke Dip Grilled Cheese&lt;/a&gt; for a complete meal!).

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that adults eat 8 ounces of seafood weekly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, many Americans don’t eat enough. No-salt-added canned tuna is one of our go-to picks; It’s budget-friendly, versatile and packed with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3s&lt;/a&gt;, which can lower blood pressure. In fact, a review that included almost 5,000 participants found that just 2 grams of omega-3s daily significantly lowered blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A 3-ounce portion of canned tuna not only provides 22 grams of high-quality protein, but it’s also a good source of calcium and potassium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Need some inspiration? Give this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7939121/avocado-tuna-spinach-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Avocado Tuna Spinach Salad&lt;/a&gt; a try. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-canned-pumpkin"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Canned Pumpkin &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Next time you shop for pantry staples, add a can of potassium-rich pumpkin to your cart. “Incorporating more potassium-rich foods like canned pumpkin can help balance out the negative side effects of salt on your blood pressure,” says Rouse.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A 1-cup serving of canned pumpkin with no added salt has around 11% of the Daily Value for potassium, which is 4,700 mg.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Canned pumpkin is not just for pumpkin pie," says Rouse. "I use it all year round in overnight oats, pumpkin oatmeal, and my kids love pumpkin muffins.” These &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/267653/pumpkin-oat-mini-muffins/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Healthy Pumpkin Muffins&lt;/a&gt; are perfect for a heart-healthy breakfast on the go or a sweet midday snack. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-canned-pineapple"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Canned Pineapple &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fresh pineapple isn’t always readily available throughout the year, so canned pineapple packed in juice is a reliable alternative. Not only is this popular tropical fruit delicious, but it may also help lower your blood pressure. A 1-cup serving of cubed pineapple has over 2 grams of fiber and is a good source of potassium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fiber has been associated with helping reduce the risk of heart disease and lower blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Swap canned pineapple for fresh in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8029298/pineapple-salsa/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Pineapple Salsa&lt;/a&gt; for your next taco night or sip on a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/251038/pineapple-green-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Pineapple Green Smoothie&lt;/a&gt; for breakfast.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-7-canned-spinach"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 7. Canned Spinach &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned spinach may not be as popular as fresh and frozen, but we think Popeye may have been onto something. Canned spinach contains a host of health-promoting nutrients, including ones that can lower blood pressure. One cup of canned spinach has over 5 grams of fiber as well as blood pressure-friendly potassium, magnesium and calcium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Green leafy vegetables like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8051884/the-1-vegetable-for-lowering-blood-pressure-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;spinach&lt;/a&gt; also contain nitrates, which help blood vessels relax, lowering blood pressure. One study found that those who consumed at least 1 cup of leafy greens per day had lower blood pressure and a lower overall risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Add canned spinach to quiche, pasta and smoothies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-8-canned-beets"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 8. Canned Beets &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Bright red and full of antioxidants, canned beets are an excellent choice for helping to maintain a healthy blood pressure,” says Ali. “They contain a variety of heart-healthy nutrients, including fiber, potassium, vitamin C and B vitamins. In addition, their beautiful red color comes from plant compounds called phytonutrients, including one called betalains—a nutrient that has been shown to help reduce inflammation and may contribute to lowering blood pressure”.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like spinach, beets are also naturally rich in nitrates, which Ali says may help lower blood pressure and decrease heart risk. Save time by using canned beets in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269012/tuna-white-bean-dill-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Tuna, White Bean &amp;amp; Dill Salad&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned foods are known to be higher in sodium. And if you’re trying to limit your sodium intake to manage high blood pressure, you may have been avoiding them. But don’t toss them out yet! Canned foods still have a lot to offer, including other blood pressure-friendly nutrients like fiber, potassium, calcium, magnesium and omega-3s. Plus, most companies make low-sodium or no-salt-added options for most of these foods. Use this list to stock your pantry with staples that will make it much easier to plan heart-healthy meals to manage your blood pressure. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His first healthy habit? Train your muscles. “Resistance training is a must if you want to live a long time. That’s because muscle mass is a longevity predictor. You don’t have to be a super buff bodybuilder. You just want to have enough muscle to be strong. Muscle keeps you mobile, helps you maintain metabolic health and blood sugar control, and makes you look good!” he says. “An easy way to start is with &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/over-40-best-exercises-for-muscle-maintenance/" target="_blank"&gt;four movements in the gym&lt;/a&gt; – push-ups, pull-ups, squats and deadlifts. If you can’t do these, use the machines or make adjustments as needed. If you don’t have access to a gym, you can use resistance bands at home.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, work on improving your VO2 max. “Your VO2 max is a measure of how much oxygen your body consumes during exercise. Scientific studies associate a higher VO2 max with living longer,” he says. “The best way to improve your VO2 max is with interval sprint training. Go to a park and warm up with a slow walk. Then, sprint for 30 seconds, all-out like a tiger is chasing you. Then go back to a slow walk and recover until your heart rate goes back to normal. Repeat the sprint/rest cycle 6-8 times. If you live near an Upgrade Labs, come in and try our AI Adaptive Bike. It gives you a personalized workout based on your fitness levels and the best part is that it only takes 5 minutes! Studies show it improves your VO2 max by 12% in just 8 weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleeping better will help you live longer, according to Asprey. “Focus on quality over quantity. If you track your sleep (which I highly recommend – see #8) aim for around 1.5 hours of deep sleep and 1.5 hours of REM sleep each night.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation is also key. “Meditation eliminates stress, which is a major driver of aging. You can meditate in a variety of different ways.

&lt;p&gt;Embrace BICEP, says Asprey. “I recently introduced a new concept in my book, Heavily Meditated. It’s called BICEP and it stands for Brief Intentional Conscious Exposure to Pain. This is why biohackers love cold plunges, why Texans love hot peppers, and why some people are addicted to getting tattoos. When you regularly do hard things for a brief amount of time your body becomes more resilient. You also reset your dopamine sensitivity, which means that life will feel easier and more pleasurable in general. Cold plunges, sauna, and high-intensity exercise are three forms of BICEP you can start doing today that will make you more resilient and support your longevity,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Build your community,” Asprey encourages.  “Not only is building community great for growth and self-improvement, it’s also good for your biology. Studies show that people who have stronger social connections live longer. Join a local club with people who are interested in the same things as you. Face-to-face interactions are best.”&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Feel gratitude daily,” Asprey continues. “Like meditation, gratitude can help reduce stress and support longevity. Start a gratitude journal. Every morning and every evening, write down 3 things you’re grateful for. This is the key – sit for a few minutes and actually FEEL the gratitude in your body. Gratitude is a feeling, not an emotion. To get the benefits, you have to feel it in your body. Maybe it feels like a warm glow around your chest. Perhaps you feel it in your hands and feet. Sit with the feeling for a few minutes each time you write in your journal. Gratitude is a muscle. You have to exercise it daily to get results.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Track your metrics. “Sure, you’re doing all of the things, but how do you know they’re working? And how do you know what’s best for you? Your biology is unique so what works for you won’t work for your neighbor. I recommend that everyone gets comprehensive labs done regularly. This is to ensure your hormones, inflammation, and nutrient levels are in the right range. I also recommend tracking metrics with an AI-powered wearable like the Oura ring. This way you can see how you’re sleeping and how well you’re recovering. Daily metrics can help guide you in refining your routine or modifying it depending on what your body is telling you on that specific day,” Asprey says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, filter your water and air. “We live in a toxic world. You might go out of your way to buy organic vegetables or unprocessed foods, but do you ever think about the air you breathe or the water you drink? Tap water can contain microplastics, heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, PFAS (forever chemicals), and more. You don’t want those in your body. They’re not good for longevity. The best strategy is to get a whole-home reverse osmosis water filter. You also want to make sure your air is clean. Breathing in pollutants can cause body-wide oxidative stress and age you rapidly. A high-quality air filter is a must!” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, get your DAKE and minerals. “Vitamin and mineral deficiencies can cause cellular dysfunction and contribute to accelerated aging. While some people will argue that a whole-food diet is sufficient to meet nutrient needs, this just isn’t true – at least if you want to thrive and live a long time,” Asprey says. “Our food isn’t what it used to be – our soil is depleted and therefore our food doesn’t have as many nutrients as it did in the past. The two most important categories of nutrients that I recommend you take are vitamin DAKE (fat-soluble vitamins D,A,K, and E) and minerals. Minerals are crucial for life as they power every reaction that goes on in your body. If you don’t have enough minerals, you’ll feel it. I recommend taking a high-quality mineral blend like the one from my company Suppgrade Labs. It contains all of the right forms in the right ratios that your body needs. Fat soluble vitamins D,A,K, and E shuttle minerals around to where they need to go to perform their actions. Suppgrade Labs also makes a high-quality Vitamin DAKE supplement that contains the most bioavailable forms of these vitamins in the correct amounts that will support your energy levels and longevity goals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

One of her last words was that she wished she had taken the vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine (SMFM), experts on high-risk pregnancy, said in a statement that it “strongly reaffirms its recommendation that pregnant patients receive the Covid-19 vaccine”, and that the vaccine is safe to receive at any time during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In a statement, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) said it was “concerned about and extremely disappointed”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We also understand that despite the change in recommendations from [health and human services], the science has not changed,” said Dr Steven J Fleischman, ACOG president. “It is very clear that Covid-19 infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability, and it can cause devastating consequences for families,” said Fleischman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy made &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/27/rfk-jr-covid-vaccine-kids-pregnant-women" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the announcement&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday on social media, flanked by Trump administration appointees to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) – neither of whom are typically involved in such decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Typically, changes to the recommended vaccine schedule are based on open public debate and the recommendation of an independent panel of experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s advisory committee on immunization practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy’s announcement circumvented both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and its advisory panel, and neither body was advised of the forthcoming decision, sources told &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/27/covid-shots-pregnant-women-children-recommendation-change-hhs-secretary-kennedy/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;STAT&lt;/a&gt;. The CDC is currently without a leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A directive making the change official, also reported by &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/27/covid-shots-pregnant-women-children-recommendation-change-hhs-secretary-kennedy/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;STAT&lt;/a&gt;, suggested that Kennedy reviewed the evidence with the FDA. That agency’s advisory committee, which is structured similarly to the CDC’s, was also bypassed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Just a week earlier, the FDA’s head, Dr Marty Makary, published a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/20/fda-vaccine-framework-new-covid-shot-recommendations-vinay-prasad-marty-makary/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;similarly unprecedented&lt;/a&gt; article in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; that described pregnancy and recent pregnancy as on a list of “underlying medical conditions that can increase a person’s risk of severe Covid-19”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As of Tuesday, the CDC’s website continued to state that those who are pregnant are at increased risk of severe illness if they contract Covid-19, including heightened risk of hospitalization and the need for intensive care. Further, evidence shows that mothers who are vaccinated pass protective immunity to infants, without the many risks that come alongside Covid-19 infection during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Infants younger than six months old are at the highest risk of severe disease among children, with the risk to children younger than four years old on par with that of 50-to-64-year-old adults, according to the Journal article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Kennedy’s unilateral decision to change the CDC’s recommended immunization schedule for Covid-19 vaccines demonstrates once again why he is completely unqualified to be the HHS secretary,” said Dr Robert Steinbrook, research director at consumer rights group Public Citizen, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In Congressional testimony on May 14, Kennedy said, ‘I don’t think people should be taking medical advice from me.’ Yet two weeks later he is making arbitrary public health decisions, defying norms, and with no accountability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Despite the known risks of contracting Covid-19 while pregnant, public health authorities have struggled to get pregnant people vaccinated. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covidvaxview/weekly-dashboard/pregnant-women-vaccination.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Dr Karen Della Corte, lead author and a BYU nutritional science professor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While seeming healthy, fruit juice is known to have a high sugar content as they tend to have added sugars and additives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even with added vitamins and nutrients, the high added sugar content in juices can overwhelm and disrupt liver metabolism - increasing liver and pancreas fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, this can lead to inflammation and result in problems with insulin release and absorption in the body - paving the way for Type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As compared to whole fruits, juice also lacks the beneficial fiber, which can disrupt gut health and impact metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have long recmmended eating whole fruits instead of drinking branded juices as they packed with fiber, which is essential for gut health, regulating blood sugar levels and keeping you feeling full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commercial juices, often have little to no fiber as it's removed during the juicing process to make the liquid free-flowing and more flavorful. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The skin and pulp of whole fruits also contains valuable vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that are often discarded during juicing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to its natural origin, honey too can be a healthier option to consume rather than fruit juices as it does not cause as rapid a spike in blood sugar and contains trace amounts of vitamins as well as minerals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Della Corte said: 'This study underscores the need for even more stringent recommendations for liquid sugars such as those in sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice, as they appear to harmfully associate with metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Rather than condemning all added sugars, future dietary guidelines might consider the differential effects of sugar based on its source and form.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was published in the journal Advances in Nutrition in May 2025.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>dailymail.co.uk</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 16:05:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxQS0MyZlZZS0pnYzFCamVXbzVpQ2RwWWJwa0k2dENtMzhxcTNUYy1ZMExmNEMwNV93d05ZczRYaWJOVzlhZHZWWE83SnhIMGZSRHhPMUp4cndkendwSXE5VnljUE1HbkV3SE9QSk1oWWJ4aDkydHEyMkh0REhHemRsNm5VUUFEUjFoOG9odE1RYk0wTkVHRTRZZFotT3RINVpKd3B3aXhFONIBrAFBVV95cUxNV1lDMExjamt1UzVuS0NVc0dLUFZIRlI0aUpBOTU5b1A0UWhrTkF6TDBUYVZjQUJIZERyb01ENWlneVJfeDdYX0o2cWtVQmtVZWVSYU5Pdk96YVQ1ZHVTdlFIM3ZhWnVpRXNZXzBiRWJ3NGFZMXM0YjBsRE9NX05MNkQ3dkx0TzYydzc2clA2bjlGQVFlaDRkeDhwaTYtWTZQNnctekl2djBRT2Jk</guid></item><item><title>两种不同的宿主专用真菌物种导致蝙蝠患白鼻病-自然 | Two distinct host-specialized fungal species cause white-nose disease in bats - Nature</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX0FVX3lxTE1kdEN2bEtqLTJYa2dYYU05c25vM2J6MkdQbWluVzVvLXhhME1hZUZpV1J1WG5tcE1oZGo5bU5EQjRWcWFYMkdzaXl3dzN5WGFMUGNRbVd0LUFPX0dtT0xj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec5-content"&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec6"&gt;Sample and field data collection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swab samples of &lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;destructans&lt;/i&gt; were collected from bat hibernacula.

After observing germination, typically 3–5 days after plating, plates were screened with a microscope to identify germinated single spores (identified as colonies expanding from a single germinating spore). Depending on availability, 1–3 (mean = 3.0, median = 3) and 1–5 (mean = 3.6, median = 2) single spores were typically isolated from bat and wall swabs, respectively. Isolation was performed by excising a plug with a sterile 3-mm biopsy punch and transferring it to a fresh 6-cm Petri dish. The plates were then visually monitored for 1 week to confirm that no additional spores germinated on the plug. Plates were grown at 10−15 °C until there was sufficient material to extract DNA (usually after several weeks to months). Each of these colonies is then referred to as an isolate or a culture. DNA extraction was done using a KingFisher Flex extraction robot (Thermo Scientific) with a MagMAX Plant DNA Isolation kit (Thermo Scientific). After DNA extraction, isolates were genotyped using 18 microsatellite markers and two mating-type markers in four multiplexes.

We used a sorbitol wash buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.35 M sorbitol, 5 mM EDTA pH 8.0 and 1% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP-40)) to clean the fungal material and to remove most of the culture medium from the hyphae (the wash was repeated twice with 5 min of incubation at room temperature each time). After removing the sorbitol wash buffer the second time (through centrifugation and removal of the liquid supernatant), 500 μl CTAB lysis buffer (preheated to 65 °C; 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.5, 25 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 1.5 M NaCl and 2% CTAB powder (w/v)), 30 μl proteinase K and 5 μl 1 M DTT were added for digestion and incubated overnight at 56 °C, mixing material after the first hour. After letting samples cool for 5 min at room temperature, 4 μl RNase A was added and left to incubate at room temperature for 10 min. One volume chloroform–isoamyl alcohol (24:1 v/v) was added, after which tubes were inverted 30 times and centrifuged for 5 min at maximum speed, keeping the supernatant. We then added a second step of proteinase K (30 μl) and RNase A (4 μl) treatment with an incubation for 30 min at 56 °C, as it was found to reduce the presence of RNA and result in better quality DNA.

A total of four pools were prepared per clade with each isolate appearing in one pool only. For &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1, a total of 69 isolates were used (pool sizes: 17, 17, 17 and 18 isolates), whereas for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2, a total of 63 isolates was used (pool sizes: 15, 16, 16 and 16 isolates). Within clades, isolates were assigned to a pool on the basis of the DNA concentration of their extracts (that is, the 17 and 15 isolates with highest DNA concentration for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2, respectively, were pooled together). The strategy of pooling samples into four pools per clade was used to validate the consistency of the results generated by each pool individually and the combined dataset (see the section ‘Genotyping’). Isolates were chosen to maximize both the geographical distance among sites and the genotypic richness within each clade. After DNA extraction (and quantification) of each isolate, DNA was combined to result in equal concentrations of isolates with a total of 500 ng DNA in a volume of 60 μl per pool.

Across all isolates, the allelic richness was high, ranging from 10 to 93 alleles per locus (mean = 37); however, we found that some alleles were fixed in the &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 clade (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;).

A genealogical interpretation of principal components analysis.

To achieve this, we chose 51 sites (the same number of sites in which &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 was found) from &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 in a way that maximized geographical distance among them (that is, thinning sites) and used up to 20 isolates per site (again, to ensure that sampling among sites was not markedly uneven). This resulted in a dataset containing 234 and 92 isolates for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2, respectively, over 51 sites each (using unique MLGs only). PCA was then performed using this &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 dataset subset and the full dataset for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2. The results revealed two clusters, which were completely differentiated. The position of the North American isolates on the PCA plot was simply determined a posteriori by projecting or predicting their coordinates using the function ‘suprow’. Considering that maximizing distance among sites may also have an influence, we confirmed these findings on the Eurasian dataset by randomly subsampling 51 sites of &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 repeatedly (100,000 times, but with the number of isolates per site still capped at 20) without considering the geographical distance between chosen sites. After running these 100,000 subsampled PCAs (with &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 unchanged, the geographically thinned PCA run was added, which resulted in a total of 100,001 PCAs), the density of values observed for PC1 was consistent with the values obtained for the thinned dataset, which indicated that the signal of differentiation between &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 was strong and independent of geography or identity of the chosen sites (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#Fig1"&gt;1b&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also used the microsatellite dataset to investigate the presence of population differentiation in each of the discovered clades. For this purpose, we investigated only Eurasian isolates (that is, excluding the 33 isolates from the United States) and treated &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we used DAPC&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 33" title="Jombart, T., Devillard, S. &amp;amp; Balloux, F.

If populations from different sites are genetically differentiated, one would expect the DAPC to assign isolates to their true site of origin (that is, where they were sampled) more often than expected by chance. Here each isolate was probabilistically assigned to sites based on the observed allele frequencies (no assumptions were made, for example, about the independence of loci). Each isolate was run in an independent DAPC, which resulted in a set of 2,191 and 279 DAPCs for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2, respectively (excluding all isolates from North America and with a limited number of 20 isolates per site, see also Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;; 120 PCA axes and 100 discriminant analysis (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) axes retained in all runs). As some isolates will always be correctly assigned by chance, it was important to quantify the percentage of correct assignments by chance compared with correct assignments based on observed allele frequencies. Hence, we ran the same sets of DAPCs after randomizing the site names (independently for each run) to ascertain the frequency of correct assignments occurring by chance and the expected distances between the isolates’ site of origin and their assigned sites if assignment was no better than random (randomized DAPC). The distances between assigned sites and sites of origin are presented in the main article for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#Fig3"&gt;3b&lt;/a&gt;) and in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#Fig13"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify the European sites of origin of the North American introduction, we performed two separate analyses with two different methods: multivariate analyses (DAPC&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 33" title="Jombart, T., Devillard, S. &amp;amp; Balloux, F.

Accurate continuous geographic assignment from low- to high-density SNP data.

DAPC analyses assign samples to sites already contained in the dataset, whereas the SPASIBA method can perform continuous assignment to any location (that is, coordinates) in the range defined by the user. First, we built a DAPC with all 5,162 &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 isolates from 226 sites in Europe (the site in the Ural Mountains was excluded). The aim of this DAPC was to differentiate sites; hence, sites were used as pre-defined groups. We then used the ‘predict.dapc’ function from the adegenet R package to predict site memberships of the 33 isolates from North America. Running the DAPC while limiting the number of isolates per site to 20 provided identical assignment results. Second, we used the SPASIBA model, a spatial Bayesian inference (SPASIBA) method for geospatial assignment that models the spatial frequency of alleles by a set of spatially autocorrelated random variables with Gaussian distribution. Implementation was carried out in R using the SPASIBA (v.24.6.27) and INLA (v.0.0.4) packages based on the same dataset as described above for the DAPC analysis. That is 5,162 &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 isolates from 226 sites in Europe for the reference data (‘geno.ref’) and 33 isolates from 9 sites in North America as individuals of unknown geographical origin to be assigned (‘geno.unknown’). For SPASIBA, we used the function ‘SPASIBA.inf’ with a ploidy level of 1 and a flat domain (sphere = false). To achieve a uniform spatial resolution, we configured the grid to consist of 198 pixels in longitude and 120 pixels in latitude. This setup ensured a consistent resolution across both dimensions, with each pixel representing an approximate resolution of 0.169°. To identify the most probable source of introduction inferred across the 33 North American isolates, we calculated the average assignment likelihood for each pixel across the 33 isolates (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;), from which we computed the log-likelihood for representation (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#Fig4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The visualization of EEMS (&lt;a href="https://github.com/dipetkov/eems"&gt;https://github.com/dipetkov/eems&lt;/a&gt;) was used to evaluate geographical barriers linked to patterns of gene flow&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 35" title="Petkova, D., Novembre, J. &amp;amp; Stephens, M.

This method differs from PCA in that genetic differentiation is visualized as a function of migration rates rather than through genetic or genotypic distance. This method uses a population genetic model to compare expected pairwise genetic dissimilarities in relation to their geographical distances (that is, under a model of isolation-by-distance) with observed patterns across the sampled area. Specifically, a triangular grid with specific density (number of demes) is built over the area containing geo-referenced samples. For the edge of each grid, the migration parameter is estimated by Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, which means that migration is estimated in an approximated stepping-stone model between neighbouring grid cells. As sampling locations will fall into the same or neighbouring cells depending on the grid cell size, the number of demes (defining the overall density of grid cells and hence their size) influences the outcome of estimated migration rates (particularly at small geographical scales). For this reason, we calculated the EEMS for a range of deme sizes (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8, 100–450 demes) in independent runs of 8 million iterations each (after a burn-in of 1 million iterations), as previously recommended&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 35" title="Petkova, D., Novembre, J. &amp;amp; Stephens, M.

It should be noted that estimated migration rates are most accurate closer to sampling locations and less accurate in sparsely sampled geographical areas. For this reason, in addition to clone-correction based on site identity (each genotype appears only once per site, additional occurrences are removed), the Russian isolates were excluded before calculating EEMS for both clades. This resulted in a total of 2,261 isolates used for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and 107 isolates for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;). Markers Pd10 and Pd14 were uninformative for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 and hence removed for the EEMS (removed for the &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 dataset only), which left a dataset with 16 markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phylogenetic relationships between the 5,479 isolates (or 1,866 MLGs) were reconstructed using Nei’s ‘Da’ genetic distance and Cavalli–Sforza and Edwards Chord distance ‘Dch’, as both distance measures were found to be the best performing ones to retrieve the relationships between individuals&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 56" title="Takezaki, N. &amp;amp; Nei, M.

In the synteny network, genes represent nodes, and syntenic relationships between genes are represented by edges connecting the nodes. A median average clustering coefficient of 0.95 was obtained across parameter settings (min–max: 0.94–0.95%; Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;), which revealed that genes tend to form a complete subgraph or cluster with their syntenic neighbours across multiple genomes. Phylogenomic profiling was then performed using the inferred syntenic clusters, which resulted in a matrix m&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;ij&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; of the phylogenomic profiles, which represented the number of genes from cluster &lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt; that can be found in genome &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;. To reveal synteny clusters that were conserved and clade-specific clusters, clusters were visualized as a heatmap with clusters clustered using Ward’s clustering on a matrix of Euclidean distance (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#Fig2"&gt;2e&lt;/a&gt;).

Fastp (v.0.23.4) was used to remove bases with a phred quality value lower than 30 (‘-q 30’). Subsequently, bwa-mem2 (v.2.2.1) was used to align the Illumina reads to each of the two reference genomes (Gd293 for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and Gd45 for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2). Samtools view (v.1.16.1) was used to only keep reads with mapped (-F 0×4), properly paired (‘-f 0×2’), and high-confidence mapping quality (MAPQ values of 60: ‘-q 60’). Samtools sort and Samtools index were used to respectively sort and index the obtained BAM files. Reads were assigned using Picard (v.2.27.1) and the AddOrReplaceReadGroups tool. The SortSam tool (from Picard) was used to sort the BAM file by queryname (QNAME) before removing duplicate reads using the MarkDuplicates tool (from Picard). SortSam was subsequently used to sort the BAM file by coordinate before indexing using Samtools index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec24"&gt;Base calling, genotyping and filtering&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then performed base calling with ‘gatk HaplotypeCaller’ (gatk v.4.2.6.1) using the ‘-ERC BP_RESOLUTION’ mode and a ploidy of 1. Genotyping was done with ‘gatk GenotypeGVCFs’. ‘gatk SelectVariants’ was then used to extract the non-variable positions in one file and the variable positions (SNP only) in another file (insertions and deletions were discarded). Hard filtering of variable positions that did not meet the criteria ‘QUAL &amp;lt; 30.0’, ‘QUAL/DP &amp;lt; 2.0’, ‘SOR &amp;gt; 3.0’, ‘FS &amp;gt; 60.0’, ‘DP &amp;lt; 20.0’ and ‘MQ &amp;lt; 40.0’ was carried out using ‘gatk VariantFiltration’ and ‘gatk SelectVariants’. Isolate genotypes with a read depth lower than 20× at a given position were set to no-call. ‘gatk SortVcf’ was then used to merge the filtered variable and non-variable positions into a single VCF file. ‘bedtools subtract’ was subsequently used to remove masked positions from the reference genome and positions called as heterozygous when considering the isolates as diploid (see the section ‘Filtering repetitive DNA’).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each contig of each of the two reference genomes (Gd293 and Gd45), we then checked for the mean read depth, when mapping the 18 isolates to each reference genome, to detect unusually high read depth that would indicate the presence of repetitive sequences in the regions that nevertheless passed our filters described above. For each contig, we also checked for the average number of isolates with missing data per position to identify contigs with high levels of missing data. For Gd45, out of eight contigs that were smaller than 50 kb, two had no reads mapped, and five out of the six remaining had unusual mean read depth (lower or higher than other contigs) and/or a high average number of isolates with missing data (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, all eight contigs below 50 kb, representing in total only 0.46% of the Gd45 genome were excluded from the analyses. For Gd293, all contigs were larger than 50 kb and a single contig (contig_44) deviated from the values observed for other contigs by having a read depth about 100× higher than other contigs and having on average 13 isolates with missing data per position (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;). This contig, most likely an accessory chromosome with a high proportion of repetitive sequences, was therefore excluded from further analyses. After all filtering steps were performed (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;), the average read depths were 237 and 240 when mapping on Gd293 and Gd45, respectively. The correlation between the read depths of the 18 genomes when mapped on Gd293 and Gd45 was 0.996 (Spearman’s rank correlation &lt;i&gt;ρ&lt;/i&gt;; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), which highlighted that the mapping worked equally well on either reference genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, each isolate had a genotype for over 95% of positions (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;). In the end, we obtained data on 21,609,224 positions when using Gd293 as the reference (including 92,593 biallelic SNPs) and 22,041,192 positions when using Gd45 as the reference (including 95,638 biallelic SNPs). These data were stored in a single VCF file (with 18 samples) per reference genome. Furthermore, to evaluate the quality of our full procedure, we checked the number of differences obtained by mapping the Illumina reads of Gd293 to the de novo-assembled MinION genome (reference genome Gd293, see the section ‘Genome assembly’ for assembly details). We did a similar analysis for Gd45 mapped to the reference genome Gd45. For Gd293, the number of differences with the reference genome (itself) was 19 variants out of 23,660,591 positions in the final VCF file, which indicated a combined mapping, base calling and genotyping error rate of 8.030231 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–7&lt;/sup&gt;; that is 1 error every 1,245,294 bp, which corresponded to a quality score of Q60.95. For Gd45 (mapped on the reference genome Gd45), the error rate was also extremely low: 2.444712 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–6&lt;/sup&gt; (54 variants out of 22,088,490 bp), or 1 error every 409,046 bp (Q56.11). These data provide evidence that our pipeline, which incorporated several stringent filters, recovered highly reliable SNPs while preserving a large amount of data (&amp;gt;22 Mb accounting for around 60% of the reference genomes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec25"&gt;Diversity and differentiation calculation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic diversity π was calculated per clade (11 for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and 7 for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2) across 50 kb windows using pixy (v.1.2.7.beta1), which takes into account missing data in calculations and hence provides unbiased estimates&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 89" title="Korunes, K.

Each of these partition methods were used in combination with each of the two reference genomes (Gd293 and Gd45; see the section ‘Data checking and mapping’), which resulted in a total of four datasets. All four datasets converged towards the same topology, recovering &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 as two reciprocally monophyletic clades (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#Fig2"&gt;2b&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM1"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec27"&gt;BUSCO phylogeny&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To produce the phylogenetic tree using newly sequenced and publicly available BUSCO genes of the isolates, we used all single copy, complete orthologues as identified from the fungi odb10 database, that were common to all 18 isolates (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;i&gt;Pseudogymnoascus&lt;/i&gt; sp. outgroup (isolate Gd267).

We used vcftools with the ‘missing-site’ function to extract missingness on a per-site basis from the VCF file containing the genotypes of the 19 (18 + 1) individuals (see the section ‘Base calling, genotyping and filtering’). Then, we calculated the number of positions with no missing data over 10 kb non-overlapping windows and only kept windows with at least 5,000 positions with no missing data across the 19 isolates. For each of the 19 isolates, we then used BEDTools getfasta to extract sequences (FASTA format) from these windows. In each window, only positions without missing data (that is, minimum 5 kb) were kept. We obtained a total of 1,275 and 1,288 genomic partitions when using the reference genomes from each clade, Gd293 and Gd45, respectively. A concatenation-based species tree with edge-linked proportional partition model with 1,000 ultrafast bootstrap (-B 1000 -T AUTO) was then produced. This procedure was applied in parallel to the data mapped on reference genomes from each clade, Gd293 and Gd45 (VCF files).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec29"&gt;Analyses of recombination&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test for the presence of recombination in each of the two clades, we used two tests, the pairwise homoplasy index (PHI or Φw) test and the four-gamete test (FGT). The Φw test calculates a pairwise similarity index between closely linked sites (situated in &lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt; bases) and compares observed values to values obtained after permutation of the sites. Under the null hypothesis of no recombination, the genealogical correlation between adjacent sites remains unchanged even if the order of the sites is shuffled. This is because all sites share the same evolutionary history when recombination is absent. However, when recombination occurs, the order of the sites becomes important as distant sites tend to have weaker genealogical correlations compared with adjacent sites&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 95" title="Bruen, T.

The FGT test involves counting the number of allelic combinations between any pair of SNPs on the same contig. Assuming an infinite site model, the observation of four combinations is incompatible with the absence of recombination. For example, if two SNPs have the alleles C/T and A/G, then the observation of the haplotypes CA, CG, TA and TG must be the result of a recombination event. We calculated the number of haplotypes using the script FGT.pl (&lt;a href="https://github.com/dbsloan/fgt"&gt;https://github.com/dbsloan/fgt&lt;/a&gt;). In each clade, we performed FGT on windows of 100 kb, with at least 20 kb of unmasked nucleotide positions and no missing data. We performed these analyses on the genomic data (Illumina data from individually tagged isolates) from the 18 isolates (11 from &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and 7 from &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2; described in section ‘Analyses of Illumina reads (individually tagged isolates)’) mapped on the reference genomes (Gd293 and Gd45) of &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 clades, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, we estimated the population recombination rate (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 2&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; is the recombination rate per bp per generation and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the effective population size) using LDhelmet software&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 97" title="Chan, A.

Default values were used for other parameters following the LDhelmet manual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from formal recombination tests carried out as explained above, we used the reconstructed phylogenetic tree obtained with microsatellite data (described in the section ‘Analyses of multilocus genotypes’) to map the two mating types. This analysis demonstrated the presence of both mating types in &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 clades, and the presence of both mating types throughout the phylogenetic tree depicting relationships between MLGs in each clade. These data provide further evidence for recombination in &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 clades (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec30"&gt;Modelling demographic history&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To model the evolutionary history of both clades, we implemented Approximate Bayesian Computation comparing two demographic models with and without contemporaneous migration. Specifically, we evaluated the isolation-migration model (IM) and the strict-isolation model (SI). These two models imply a population split at a time &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;split&lt;/sub&gt; in the past, but this event is followed by constant migration in the IM model or no migration in the SI model. The ancestral population and the derived population have an independent population size (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

One million simulations were performed for both models using a mutation rate of 1.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–9&lt;/sup&gt; mutation per site per generation, a recombination rate half of the mutation rate, a &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;split&lt;/sub&gt; between 10 and 10 million generations and an &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; between 10 and 10 million individuals per population. As performing the analyses on the full genome would be computationally too intensive (for the simulations part), we instead used a representative sample across the genome.

Parameter estimations were obtained using the neural network method implemented in the abc package using 5,000 simulations.

The rejection method led to the selection of the SI model 79% and 76% of the times for reference Gd293 and Gd45, respectively. Therefore, both model-selection methods support the model without contemporaneous migration.

Based on the SI model, the divergence time between &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 clades was estimated to have occurred between 114,000 and 1.5 generations ago (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec31"&gt;Analyses of Illumina reads (Pool-seq data)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec32"&gt;Data checking and mapping&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We checked and mapped the Illumina data (each of the four pools per clade) as detailed in the section ‘Data checking and mapping’ for Illumina reads above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec33"&gt;Data pooling&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each of &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2, we had four pools (hereafter called ‘subpools’) of isolates (with 17, 18, 17 and 17 isolates for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and 16, 16, 16 and 15 isolates for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2). Before combining the four subpools per clade, we calculated the number of reads per subpool and subsampled them with Samtools view to have the same number of reads per isolate (1,704,260 reads) in each subpool. We then used Samtools merge to merge BAM files for the four subpools per clade, which resulted in one final pool (pool of four subpools) of 69 isolates for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 (117,589,122 reads) and one final pool (pool of four subpools) of 63 isolates for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 (107,355,848 reads).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec34"&gt;Genotyping&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genotyping was carried out separately for each pool (one for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and one for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2), mapped on the reference genome from clade 1 and 2, which resulted in four separate analyses. Samtools mpileup was then used to generate pileup outputs from BAM files. For SNP calling, we applied a Bayesian approach specifically designed for pools (SNAPE-pooled&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 104" title="Guirao-Rico, S. &amp;amp; González, J.

SNAPE-pooled prior parameters were sets as follows: &lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt;  =  0.0005, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;  =  0.0025 or &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0005 when mapping the pool on the reference from the different versus same clade respectively, prior = ‘informative’, fold = ‘folded’, and nchr = number of (haploid) isolates in the pool. We converted the SNAPE-pooled output file to a VCF and as recommended by the program developers, we only considered positions with a posterior probability ≥0.9 as being polymorphic. In all other cases, positions were marked as monomorphic. To avoid including sequencing errors as rare alleles, we adopted two complementary strategies. First, when converting the SNAPE-pooled output to a VCF, we only included alleles that were supported by at least five reads in the pool (that is, the four subpools together). Second, we performed SNAPE-pooled analyses on each subpool (with parameters as described above) to identify alleles that were not supported by at least two reads in two subpools. These alleles were then removed from the VCF file of the pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec35"&gt;Data filtering&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To limit false-positive SNPs, we applied further filters to the VCF file to remove the following: (1) regions where repetitive DNA elements were either confirmed or suspected; (2) regions with low or high read depth (based on the Pool-seq data); and (3) regions that were identified as problematic based on read depth of individually tagged isolates (see the section ‘Base calling, genotyping and filtering’ of Illumina reads).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec36"&gt;Filtering repetitive DNA&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The removal of regions with confirmed or suspected repetitive DNA (including paralogues) that could not be confidently mapped with short-read data was carried out using three complementary approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we removed regions that were masked from the reference genome (see the section ‘Repeat annotation’).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, we removed regions suspected to contain hidden repetitive DNA. Although we removed regions that were masked from the reference genome (see above), a single or a set of genomes (18 in our case, see section ‘Repeat annotation’) is unlikely to harbour the full extent of the repertoire existing in repetitive DNA in a larger number of isolates such as in the Pool-seq dataset. Hidden repetitive DNA can generate spurious heterozygous genotypes that can confound the estimation of genetic differentiation between populations or species (for example, ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 106" title="Badouin, H. et al. Widespread selective sweeps throughout the genome of model plant pathogenic fungi and identification of effector candidates. Mol. Ecol. 26, 2041–2062 (2017)." href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#ref-CR106" id="ref-link-section-d29254788e3166"&gt;106&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). Hence, when using reads from an isolate that was not used to build the repeat library or the filters (for example, Pool-seq data), the unique mapping of its reads to a reference genome does not per se confirm that these reads originated from non-duplicated regions. We used levels of genetic diversity (π) as a proxy to detect hidden repetitive DNA. Repetitive DNA elements sharing a common ancestor accumulate mutations; therefore, when such loci (two or more copies) are erroneously merged together as a single locus, one expects higher levels of genetic diversity provided that everything else remains equal. We therefore removed regions with levels of π greater than 1%. This threshold was obtained by calculating the level of genetic diversity observed across 18 genomes rather than pools of individuals (see the section ‘Analyses of Illumina reads (individually tagged isolates)’; Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;) for which only 0.43% and 1.43% of sites for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2, respectively, showed π values greater than 1%. π was calculated per site using pixy (v.1.2.7.beta1), which takes into account missing data in calculations and hence provides unbiased estimates&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 89" title="Korunes, K.

Each of the 18 isolates (as listed in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; (except the outgroup)) were mapped against the reference genome (as per the section ‘Data checking and mapping’ for Illumina reads) and analysed in diploid mode (that is, considering that the isolate is diploid). For this, we used the same pipeline as for base calling isolates (with gatk; see the section ‘Analyses of Illumina reads (individually tagged isolates)’) but with ploidy of 2. Sites scored as heterozygote in at least one isolate were recorded in a BED file. A total of 183,756 heterozygote sites (spread across contigs) were identified in those 18 genomes when using Gd293 as the reference and 177,785 when using Gd45 as the reference. All those heterozygote sites were removed from all 18 genomes, irrespective the isolates they originated from. Although these data alone might indicate that &lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;destructans&lt;/i&gt; is diploid, results from the microsatellite analysis firmly refuted this hypothesis. Indeed, we genotyped 5,479 isolates originating from single spore (that is, monosporic isolation) cultures for 18 microsatellite loci (see the section ‘Cultures and genotyping’), and out of the 98,622 genotypes (5,479 × 18), we never encountered 2 alleles per locus for any single spore isolate. Two alleles for some loci and some isolates would be expected if &lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;destructans&lt;/i&gt; was diploid. Furthermore, such levels of heterozygosity have already been reported when base calling haploids in diploid mode in other fungal species (for example, ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 109" title="Li, X. et al.

These regions contained in the final BED file were then excluded from the VCF file in BEDTools substract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec37"&gt;Filtering based on read depth&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many species of fungi have accessory chromosomes, and the results from the section ‘Base calling, genotyping and filtering’ provide strong evidence that this is also the case for both of the &lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;destructans&lt;/i&gt; clades. As a result, stringent filtering based on read depth alone was not possible. We therefore only performed light filtering by setting sites with a read depth below 20× or above 600× per pool as missing data. Based on read depth and levels of missing data from individually tagged isolates (section ‘Data checking and mapping’ for Illumina reads; Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;), we identified a few problematic contigs that were also filtered out from the Pool-seq data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec38"&gt;Filtering outcomes&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The filtering steps described in the previous two sections resulted in a narrowing of the 95% highest density interval (hdi95) of the read depth for both clades when mapped to the reference genome of both clades (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM1"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;).

When using reference genome Gd293, &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 hdi95 narrowed down from 92–512 to 236–523 whereas &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 hdi95 narrowed down from 5–511 to 227–542. Positions filtered out were mostly, although not exclusively, positions with read depth less than 200 (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM1"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;), which meant that accessory chromosomes constitute a substantial part of the data filtered out.

Images were imported into R using the readImage function that extracts the intensity of each pixel of the red, green and blue channels. Pixels with red intensity above 0.7 were characteristic of cultures, whereas the background (culture medium) was below 0.7. Coordinates (that is, their position in the image) of pixels with red intensity above 0.7 were stored and used to calculate the minimum convex polygon (MCP) using the mcp function of the adehabitatHR package. The MCP was used to outline the edge of the fungal growth and to calculate the number of pixels it covered. To overcome potential issues with dark non-fungal material present on the plate (for example, droplets of water or dirt) that would be included in 100% MCPs and hence artificially increase culture size, we calculated 11 MCPs per isolate, excluding 5−15% of outliers in steps of 1 (11 values; that is, MCP 85 until 95%). We then extrapolated the number of pixels covered by the fungus (for example, for an isolate covering 180 pixels calculated with an MCP 90%: 180/90 × 100 = 200 pixels). For each MCP, pixels were finally transformed to square centimetres with the use of cross multiplication in relation to an object of known size (5.207681 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). For each isolate, the average across the 11 MCPs was used, and the quality of the estimates was evaluated using the standard deviation of the estimate made for the 11 MCPs and visual inspection of the edge of the MCPs depicted on top of the original picture. Resulting culture sizes are visualized in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#Fig8"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec42"&gt;Analysis of culture darkness&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The colouration of culture medium as a result of culture growth was measured from the same pictures taken for the analysis of growth (see the section ‘Analysis of growth’; 45 isolates for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and 34 isolates for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2).

Colour images were transformed into black and white images, and the pixel density (a value from 0 to 1; 1 being white and 0 being black) was recorded in 3 rectangles distributed on the area showing the culture medium (that is, not touching the edge of the culture and also avoiding the centre with fungal growth). The median pixel density among the three rectangles was used as a proxy for culture darkness. For each isolate, the difference in pixel density between the picture taken after 1 week and that taken after 8 weeks was calculated (8 weeks – 1 week, resulting in a positive value if darkness increased, a negative value when darkness decreased).

For this analysis, closely related bat species that are challenging to identify during hibernation were pooled together. Furthermore, to improve model convergence and to ensure identifiability of the model, only the most commonly infected species, that is, species from which we isolated &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt; at ten or more sites were included in the model. This resulted in a dataset comprising 4,295 isolates from 231 sites in Europe, broken down as follows: &lt;i&gt;M.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;mystacinus&lt;/i&gt; (28 isolates, 10 sites); &lt;i&gt;M.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;dasycneme&lt;/i&gt; (107 isolates, 11 sites); &lt;i&gt;M.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;daubentonii&lt;/i&gt; (111 isolates, 17 sites); &lt;i&gt;Myotis&lt;/i&gt; species complex (322 isolates, 38 sites); and &lt;i&gt;M.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;myotis&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;blythii&lt;/i&gt; (3,727 isolates, 187 sites). We fit a Bayesian hierarchical model using clade identity as our response variable and a logit link function. Bat species, latitude and longitude were included as population-level effects (analogous to a fixed effect in a frequentist approach), whereas samples (nested within sites) and sites were included as group effect (analogous to a random effect in a frequentist approach) with random intercept. The group-level effects were used to account for variations between sites and between samples within site. Given that both &lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;destructans&lt;/i&gt; clades were found in roughly equal numbers in &lt;i&gt;M.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;mystacinus&lt;/i&gt; (13 and 15 isolates for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2, respectively), this bat species was used as the baseline category. To estimate the model parameters and to perform Bayesian inference, the model was fitted using 8 chains with 10,000 iterations each. To improve convergence, the ‘adapt_delta’ parameter, controlling the acceptance rate of the algorithm, was set to 0.99. The first 1,000 iterations of each chain were discarded as warm-up (burn-in) to ensure convergence. Chains were sampled using the NUTS (No-U-Turn Sampler) algorithm in Stan (&lt;a href="https://mc-stan.org/"&gt;https://mc-stan.org/&lt;/a&gt;) with the brms (v. 2.20.3)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 124" title="Bürkner, P.-C. brms: an R package for Bayesian multilevel models using stan.

Using this approach, a set of isolates from the Czech Republic (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3), Portugal (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 13) and South Korea (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 2) could be identified as belonging to clade &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;), for example. These data combined with the data presented in the main text confirmed that &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 co-occur in Europe, but thus far, only &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 has been found in East Asia (one isolate from China, one from Mongolia, two from South Korea). This result suggests that &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 is rarer in East Asia or perhaps even absent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec46"&gt;Reporting summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further information on research design is available in the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM2"&gt;Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary&lt;/a&gt; linked to this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 15:51:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE1kdEN2bEtqLTJYa2dYYU05c25vM2J6MkdQbWluVzVvLXhhME1hZUZpV1J1WG5tcE1oZGo5bU5EQjRWcWFYMkdzaXl3dzN5WGFMUGNRbVd0LUFPX0dtT0xj</guid></item><item><title>皮肤和脖子上有微妙的迹象，这意味着您可能会因100米而遭受致命疾病-每日邮报 | Subtle signs on your skin and neck that mean you could have deadly condition suffered by 100m - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unexplained changes in your skin can occur for a number of reasons - whether it's from time in the sun or allergies. However, a health coach warns they could be a sign of something more sinister. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jade Rivers, a wellness coach, recently revealed 'what a body looks like when it's heading toward [type 2] diabetes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the condition globally and over 37million American adults suffer from this form of the chronic illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is caused by &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11238421/Even-SLIM-type-2-diabetics-reverse-condition.html"&gt;either the pancreas not producing enough insulin&lt;/a&gt; or the body's cells not responding properly to insulin. This leads to high blood sugar levels and a buildup of glucose in the bloodstream, which can damage the eyes, kidneys, nerves and heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is often linked to lifestyle factors like obesity, poor diet and lack of physical activity and because it develops gradually, people may not know they have it until serious complications arise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, according to Rivers, if people are able to recognize several changes in their bodies that indicate insulin resistance - a precursor to diabetes that plagues 100million people - they may be able to make changes and reverse it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Below, DailyMail.com details the unexpected signs you could be headed toward a type 2 diabetes diagnosis: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Dark patches on the neck and underarms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Insulin resistance can lead to the build of the hormone in the body, which can cause dark spots and rashes on the skin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dark, velvety patches on the skin, often in body folds like the neck and armpits, can be a sign of acanthosis nigricans (AN).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a skin condition often associated with obesity and insulin resistance, and a possible early sign of type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patches are not caused by diabetes itself, but rather by the underlying insulin resistance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AN is characterized by dark, velvety patches in areas across the body like the neck, armpits, groin, and sometimes on the hands, elbows, or knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is typically a sign your body is making extra insulin. When the body is resistant to insulin, the pancreas may overproduce the hormone in order to compensate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This excess insulin then builds up and causes the dark patches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it can cause embarrassment and some people may try to scrub or bleach the patches away, this is not effective in getting rid of the dark spots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, you should change your diet to include more healthy foods and get physical activity. Losing weight can also help. This will lower the amount of excess insulin in the body and can alleviate AN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox mol-style-bold mol-style-large"&gt;Skin tags&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Skin tags, also known as acrochordons, are small, harmless growths often found in areas where skin folds or rubs together, such as the neck, armpits and groin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They may also appear where skin rubs against clothing or jewelry and are caused by friction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While typically benign, if you begin noticing the appearance of more skin tags than is normal for you, a trip to the doctor may be in order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jade Rivers, a wellness expert, who noted that dark patches on the neck and underarms and a slight hump on at the neck are all signs that your body is heading towards Type 2 diabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In people with insulin resistance, skin tags form because insulin plays a role in regulating cell growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When someone is insulin resistant and the pancreas produces too much, it can stimulate the growth of skin cells, which in turn can lead to skin tags. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, insulin resistance can disrupt the balance of the hormone insulin-growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which is linked to skin tag formation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox mol-style-bold mol-style-large"&gt;A hump or fat around your neck Neck&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A neck hump, sometimes called a buffalo hump, is a fat pad that forms at the base of the back of the neck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Being insulin resistant and struggling with a build up of insulin in the body leads to weight gain, fat accumulation and a struggle to lose weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could cause fat deposits to collect in certain areas of the body, such as the neck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the hormone imbalance caused by insulin resistance or full-blown diabetes contributes to abnormal fat distribution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like many other symptoms of insulin resistance, a hump or fat around the neck can be alleviated by diet and exercise changes, which can lead to healthy weight loss.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Male fertility rates have been plummeting &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/humupd/dmac035"&gt;over the past half-century&lt;/a&gt;. An analysis from 1992 noted a steady decrease in sperm counts and quality &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.305.6854.609"&gt;since the 1940s&lt;/a&gt;. A more recent study found that male infertility rates &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-023-16793-3"&gt;increased nearly 80% from 1990 to 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The reasons driving this trend remain a mystery, but frequently cited culprits include &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/mou.0000000000000745"&gt;obesity, poor diet and environmental toxins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fertility-academy.co.uk/blog/7-stis-that-affect-male-fertility/"&gt;Infectious diseases&lt;/a&gt; such as gonorrhea or chlamydia are often overlooked factors that affect fertility in men. Accumulating evidence suggests that a common single-celled parasite called &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/toxoplasmosis/about/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; may also be a contributor: An April 2025 study showed for the first time that “human sperm &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;lose their heads&lt;/a&gt; upon direct contact” with the parasite.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am a microbiologist, and &lt;a href="https://medicine.iu.edu/faculty/13502/sullivan-william"&gt;my lab studies &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This new study bolsters emerging findings that underscore the importance of preventing this parasitic infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-many-ways-you-can-get-toxoplasmosis"&gt;The many ways you can get toxoplasmosis&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Infected cats defecate &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; eggs into the litter box, garden or other places in the environment where they can be &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1079/ahr2005100"&gt;picked up by humans or other animals&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11162542"&gt;Water, shellfish and unwashed fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; can also harbor infectious parasite eggs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to eggs, tissue cysts present in the meat of warm-blooded animals can spread toxoplasmosis as well if they are not destroyed by &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/people-risk-foodborne-illness/toxoplasma-food-safety-moms-be"&gt;cooking to proper temperature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While most hosts of the parasite can control the initial infection with few if any symptoms, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; remains in the body for life as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6976.2011.00305.x"&gt;dormant cysts in brain, heart and muscle tissue&lt;/a&gt;. These cysts can reactivate and cause additional episodes of severe illness that damage critical organ systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090203"&gt;30% and 50% of the world’s population&lt;/a&gt; is permanently infected with &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; due to the many ways the parasite can spread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-toxoplasma-can-target-male-reproductive-organs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can target male reproductive organs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Upon infection, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; spreads to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/pim.12163"&gt;virtually every organ and skeletal muscle&lt;/a&gt;. Evidence that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can also target human male reproductive organs first surfaced &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3755328"&gt;during the height of the AIDS pandemic&lt;/a&gt; in the 1980s, when some patients presented with the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5812/jjm.7184"&gt;parasitic infection in their testes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While immunocompromised patients are most at risk for testicular toxoplasmosis, it can also occur in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2018-224962"&gt;otherwise healthy individuals&lt;/a&gt;. Imaging studies of infected mice confirm that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; parasites &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-5822.2005.00517.x"&gt;quickly travel to the testes&lt;/a&gt; in addition to the brain and eyes within days of infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, my colleagues and I found that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/pros.23362"&gt;form cysts in mouse prostates&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers have also observed these parasites in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5812/jjm.7184"&gt;ejaculate of many animals&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2022.10.034"&gt;human semen&lt;/a&gt;, raising the possibility of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109725"&gt;sexual transmission&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Knowing that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can reside in male reproductive organs has prompted analyses of fertility in infected men. A small 2021 study in Prague of 163 men infected with &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; found that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/andr.12969"&gt;over 86% had semen anomalies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A 2002 study in China found that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12479125/"&gt;infertile couples are more likely&lt;/a&gt; to have a &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; infection than fertile couples, 34.83% versus 12.11%. A 2005 study in China also found that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16078665"&gt;sterile men are more likely to test positive&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; than fertile men.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26622295/"&gt;Not all studies&lt;/a&gt;, however, produce a link between toxoplasmosis and sperm quality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-toxoplasma-can-directly-damage-human-sperm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can directly damage human sperm&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Toxoplasmosis in animals mirrors infection in humans, which allows researchers to address questions that are not easy to examine in people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Testicular function and sperm production are sharply diminished in &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;-infected &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0096770"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2023.108571"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens9121004"&gt;rams&lt;/a&gt;. Infected mice have significantly lower sperm counts and a higher proportion of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107573"&gt;abnormally shaped sperm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In that April 2025 study, researchers from Germany, Uruguay and Chile observed that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can reach the testes &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/epididymis"&gt;and epididymis&lt;/a&gt;, the tube where sperm mature and are stored, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;two days after infection&lt;/a&gt; in mice. This finding prompted the team to test what happens when the parasite comes into direct contact with human sperm in a test tube.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After only five minutes of exposure to the parasite, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;22.4% of sperm cells were beheaded&lt;/a&gt;. The number of decapitated sperm increased the longer they interacted with the parasites. Sperm cells that maintained their head were often &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;twisted and misshapen&lt;/a&gt;. Some sperm cells had holes in their head, suggesting the parasites were trying to invade them as it would any other type of cell in the organs it infiltrates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to direct contact, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; may also damage sperm because the infection promotes &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/pros.23362"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. Inflammatory conditions in the male reproductive tract are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26913230/"&gt;harmful to sperm production and function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers speculate that the harmful effects &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; may have on sperm could be contributing to large global declines in male fertility over the past decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-preventing-toxoplasmosis"&gt;Preventing toxoplasmosis&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The evidence that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can infiltrate male reproductive organs in animals is compelling, but whether this produces health issues in people remains unclear. Testicular toxoplasmosis shows that parasites can invade human testes, but &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2025.116709"&gt;symptomatic disease is very rare&lt;/a&gt;. Studies to date that show defects in the sperm of infected men are too small to draw firm conclusions at this time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, some reports suggest that rates of toxoplasmosis in high-income countries &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2022.10.003"&gt;have not been increasing&lt;/a&gt; over the past few decades while male infertility was rising, so it’s likely to only be one part of the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regardless of this parasite’s potential effect on fertility, it is wise to avoid &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;. An infection can cause miscarriage or birth defects if someone acquires it for the first time during pregnancy, and it can be life-threatening for immunocompromised people. &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; is also the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/toxoplasmosis/about/index.html"&gt;leading cause of death from foodborne illness&lt;/a&gt; in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taking &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/23408"&gt;proper care of your cat&lt;/a&gt;, promptly cleaning the litter box and thoroughly washing your hands after can help reduce your exposure to &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;. You can also protect yourself from this parasite by washing fruits and vegetables, &lt;a href="https://www.foodsafety.gov/food-safety-charts/safe-minimum-internal-temperatures"&gt;cooking meat to proper temperatures&lt;/a&gt; before consuming and avoiding &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/605433"&gt;raw shellfish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-does-raw-water-compare-to-tap-water-a-microbiologist-explains-why-the-risks-outweigh-the-benefits-246866"&gt;raw water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.1982.03330140038029"&gt;raw milk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is the first country to begin clinical trials of artificial blood, a medical innovation which if proven successful, would solve one of the largest hospital challenges of our age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning back in March, a clinical trial &lt;a href="https://mededgemea.com/japan-to-begin-clinical-trials-for-artificial-blood-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;organized&lt;/a&gt; by Nara Medical University will look to build on the success of an early-stage trial in 2022 of hemoglobin vesicles, small artificial blood cells that were confirmed to be safe and capable of delivering oxygen as normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial will administer 100 to 400 milliliters of the artificial blood cells to further test safety before moving onto broader performance and efficacy targets, all in the hopes that by 2030, the artificial blood could enter clinical use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether high-income or low-income, every country has challenges meeting the necessity necessary amounts of stockpiled blood donations for emergency medical procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high-income countries where the 90% of blood stockpiles comes from voluntary donors, the challenge is getting enough of these donations, and crucially, enough from those with rare blood types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In low-income countries where only 40% of needs are met with donations, the challenge lies in importation from abroad when donated blood packs are only safe for use for a few months. A useful proxy to understanding this shortfall is that of 175 countries included in a survey of blood donation and use practices by the World Health Organization, 106 countries report that all blood plasma-derived products are imported. These include things like immunoglobulins and coagulation factors which are needed to prevent and treat a variety of serious conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan has a different challenge. The WHO &lt;a href="https://aho.org/fact-sheets/blood-safety-and-availability-factsheet/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that the use of donated blood varied with income levels, reporting that high-income countries used more blood donations to treat those aged 65 and older, while lower-income countries used it to treat those aged 5 and under.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE HORIZON OF MEDICAL RESEARCH: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="NIH Funding Now Will Prioritize Research That Eschews Animal Testing to Push Innovation" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/nih-funding-now-to-prioritize-research-that-eschews-animal-testing-for-better-ethics-and-efficacy/" rel="bookmark"&gt;NIH Funding Now Will Prioritize Research That Eschews Animal Testing to Push Innovation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan has recognized that its long-since-collapsed replacement birth rate coupled with long life-expectancy will place a likely unsustainable burden of blood donation on a shrinking working-age population, making artificial blood a priority innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Hiromi Sakai at Nara Medical University has pioneered one method for its synthesis. Using hemoglobin—the oxygen carrying molecule inside red blood cells—from expired donations and encasing them in protective shells, removing the need of matching blood type for administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE MEDICAL ADVANCEMENTS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Cure for Pre-Eclampsia is On Horizon as Researcher Discovers Lipid Nanoparticle to Deliver Directly to Placenta" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/cure-for-pre-eclampsia-is-on-horizon-as-researcher-discovers-lipid-nanoparticle-to-deliver-directly-to-placenta/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Cure for Pre-Eclampsia is On Horizon as Researcher Discovers Lipid Nanoparticle to Deliver Directly to Placenta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another method comes from Chuo University where the hemoglobin is encased in an albumin-family protein, which &lt;a href="https://www.chuo-u.ac.jp/english/news/2023/07/67032/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;has been used in animal studies&lt;/a&gt; to stabilize blood pressure and treat conditions like hemorrhage and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, the necessity is there and it’s urgent for Japan and the world. If the country’s researchers succeed in this innovation, it will be a medical milestone of epic proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHARE This Encouraging Clinical Development On Route From Japan…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In some cases, it's all they'll eat, even if it means chomping down on some &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/entertainment/netflix/liver-king-netflix-documentary-wife-diet-testicles-371631-20250513"&gt;bulls' testicles&lt;/a&gt; to make sure your protein is of the highest possible percentage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Which is obviously a completely sane thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;One of the easiest and quickest sources of protein these days seemingly comes from little bars, which are seen as a great snack if you're out running, and it certainly makes more sense than bringing an entire chicken breast with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It's difficult to argue with that concept, especially if you're doing exercise, as the protein can be a great way to help your muscles recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Protein bars have long been thought to be good for athletes (Getty Stock)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, experts recently &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/are-protein-bars-good-for-you-muscle-growth-256878-20250526"&gt;delivered a warning&lt;/a&gt; to anyone who eats them regularly, as a study found that lots of them can be ultra-processed and perhaps don't contain as much protein as we are led to believe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The study reveals the most commonly used protein source inside the bars, saying: "The most frequently used protein source was soy protein (isolate) with the relevance of 22 per cent, followed by peanuts (13 per cent) and WPI (whey protein isolate, 11 per cent). The remaining 12 per cent of all primary protein sources were distributed into two larger categories; (i) present in above one per cent of all protein bars, such as oats, milk-based proteins (whey protein hydrolysates and calcium caseinate) and cashews present in under one per cent of all protein bars, some oily seeds (e.g., pumpkin, sunflower, hemp), beef-based proteins (beef and collagen) and special protein sources."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It is also suggested that the other ingredients, which are added to the bars, namely things like chocolate, nuts and wafer, obviously make the protein bar a bit tastier, but they are also having a detrimental effect on the digestibility of the protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Maybe it's all just a placebo (Getty Stock)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Researchers stated: "These additional components all affect the digestibility of proteins and accessibility of amino acids therefore could considerably change their protein nutritional quality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The researchers studied 1,641 bars in total and classified 18 bars (one per cent) as 'not protein source', 295 bars (18 per cent) as a 'protein source' 1,328 bars (81 per cent) as 'high in protein'. according to EU labelling criteria on protein related claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Study authors add: "The results show that lower protein digestibility values (between 47 and 81 per cent) were measured when the proteins were included as a component of the protein bar matrix than when the digestibility of the same proteins was evaluated in a pure format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Although most protein bars are labelled ‘high in protein’, their protein nutritional quality could be very low based on Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score (DIAAS). The low numbers are most probably due to application of lower-nutritional-quality proteins (such as collagen) and of other ingredients such as carbohydrates, fats and fibres, that might deteriorate the bio-accessibility of essential amino acids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;So, to sum that up for you, protein bars that claim to be high in protein may actually not have much protein in them at all, and if they do, it could be ultra processed food items, which the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; will tell you aren't particularly good for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 15:24:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPUG5obUpnMWl3eE9PR3VRc1U1Y241TWFYTXV5S2xtdkZLTXBqaGJxOUpqSWZ4WU5yb2NIVW9hZVlLcEJZcGthQ1AtYUNYcC1ObjlkdS1LOGt5NnI5VUlMeG1xRndQSWFEaEc4QUNaOWlHSE11VjgyeExSc1gwWkJDQTJVd2Jhdk1CMEc4U3J5SFdfdHEwUEpOS2NwcUlBbXM</guid></item><item><title>你的道德指南针与你如何与你的身体和谐相处有关，学习提示- Live Science | Your moral compass is tied to how in tune you are with your body, study hints - Live Science</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxQdnRxTkdyZF90WWJGMDNRMzI4UHVwc2tDLUs0OHowLW4zSmp6c0xNVUtleHJHOE1JYi1TTTBsR0N1WVZyMTU0WjV3eGhPN201Z3BRZDFURElERFhQeWowUVZOTUZVZHFyMGdoY3NJd3BKZ194c3Q5QTZ0VS1tN2tDcXpYM2d3VU12YndueWV1TmFZc1VncTFTQjdWbS1QOUZyY3ZDR19HRmhodWVqbUdYWllhSThvY3hzeFRJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When wrestling with a moral dilemma, a person may reach a decision not only by thinking through the problem but also by tuning into physical signals from their body, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research found that people who are more in tune with their body signals — such as shifts in their heart rate — tend to make moral decisions that align with the judgments that most other people would make if presented the same scenario. These findings suggest that such internal, physical cues could thus play a role in guiding a person's moral intuition, the study authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Morality is often viewed as a product of culture and context," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/news/global_outlook/research_highlights/rh_01_202107" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/news/global_outlook/research_highlights/rh_01_202107" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tamami Nakano&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Osaka who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email. "Showing that bodily signals actively mediate this calibration is both novel and compelling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the study supports the idea that these bodily reactions form part of a feedback loop that helps guide people in their decision making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8645214/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8645214/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;previous studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have suggested that siding with the majority in a moral dilemma could help take some strain off the brain, and the new study seems to align with that notion, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Recent theories suggest that our brains are designed to minimize physical resource consumption while maintaining survival," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://socialdecisionneurosciencelab.org/people" target="_blank" data-url="https://socialdecisionneurosciencelab.org/people" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hackjin Kim&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscientist at Korea University, told Live Science in an email. "One way to do this [conserve energy] is to learn others' expectations to avoid social conflict," Kim suggested. Combining these ideas, Kim and colleagues proposed that people who are better attuned to their bodily feedback signals may use that information to keep their decision-making in line with others' expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/human-behavior/people-really-can-communicate-with-just-their-eyes-study-finds" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/human-behavior/people-really-can-communicate-with-just-their-eyes-study-finds"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People really can communicate with just their eyes, study finds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-TYjrsyrCtyuBdRvPhimvpc" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-TYjrsyrCtyuBdRvPhimvpc slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their new study, published May 5 in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2025/04/28/JNEUROSCI.1114-24.2025" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2025/04/28/JNEUROSCI.1114-24.2025" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the team tested this hypothesis by presenting participants with moral dilemmas and asking them to choose between two decisions — one "utilitarian," which prioritized minimizing harm for the most people, and one "deontological," which prioritized following established rules and norms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate test, the researchers asked the participants to focus on their bodies and count their heartbeats over a short interval while the participants' heartbeats were simultaneously recorded with an electrocardiogram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who were more accurate at counting their heartbeats also tended to choose the moral decision that most other people chose, the team found. This was true whether more people chose the utilitarian or deontological option for a given moral dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be that cues from a person's body help signal when the person is about to do something that could run up against social norms — a scenario that requires more energy and effort to navigate, the study authors propose. Basically, it's easier to go with the flow than run against the grain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The idea is that feeling that anxiety is going to make you notice that you did something to cause that anxiety, and then make you try to avoid doing those things in the future," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/jordan-theriault/" target="_blank" data-url="https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/jordan-theriault/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jordan Theriault&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a psychologist and biologist at Northeastern University who was not involved in the study. "You feel that feedback from your body, and then you learn not to do that again in the future," he told Live Science. As Theriault describes, you learn over time what others expect of you morally, and your physical reactions form part of the feedback loop that helps guide future decision making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, participants responded to each dilemma without knowing which of the two options other people chose. They weren't pressured into making a certain decision or conforming to what the rest of the group unknowingly agreed upon, so the results reflect each individuals' moral intuition. Notably, all 104 participants were Korean university students, so it's possible they shared similar cultural and demographic backgrounds as well as similar moral norms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also studied people's brains while at rest to determine how much time they spent in different "brain states" — patterns of brain activity associated with different kinds of tasks. The brain switches back and forth between many different states even when a person isn't doing anything specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To track these states, the team used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which tracks blood flow as an indirect measure of brain activity. The researchers found that the people who were more aware of their body's signals tended to spend more time in a brain state associated with evaluation and judgment. This particular state was marked by activity in a brain region called the medial prefrontal cortex, which has previously been linked to the process of adjusting choices to meet other people's expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/how-much-of-your-brain-do-you-need-to-survive" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/how-much-of-your-brain-do-you-need-to-survive"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much of your brain do you need to survive?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These brain scans may further support the idea that people who are more in tune with their bodily signals use those cues to stay aligned with majority opinion. However, because these data were collected separately from the moral-decision tasks, "we still need task-based evidence showing which specific brain regions process body-related signals when people face real moral dilemmas and how these signals influence behavior in real time," Nakano told Live Science. This might involve having people contend with moral dilemmas while in an fMRI scanner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In future work, Kim plans to investigate how the relationship between moral intuition and awareness of body signals varies among cultures, types of moral dilemmas and individual personality differences. But for now, Kim said, "this research lays a new theoretical framework for understanding cultural and individual differences in moral behavior and predicting norm-following behavior in group or online settings."&lt;/p&gt;

As they surveyed colonies of hibernating bats, they discovered heaps of dead animals on the floors of caves and abandoned mines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The culprit was a fungus new to science. It caused white-nose disease, named for the fuzzy pale tendrils that sprouted from the nostrils of its victims. (The disease was originally known as white-nose syndrome, but was renamed in recent years.) The fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, or P. destructans, has &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.whitenosesyndrome.org/where-is-wns" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;spread&lt;/a&gt; from New York to 40 states and nine Canadian provinces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“This is the most dramatic wildlife mortality event that’s ever been documented from a pathogen,” said DeeAnn Reeder, a disease ecologist at Bucknell University. “Millions and millions and millions of animals have died.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In recent years, bat experts have gained some &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/science/bats-white-nose-syndrome.html" title=""&gt;guarded optimism&lt;/a&gt;.

              &lt;p&gt;As we enter the colder months in Australia, covid is &lt;a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/public-health/covid-19-new-subvariant-nb181-driving-increase-in-infections-in-wa-c-18801659"&gt;making headlines&lt;/a&gt; again, this time due to the emergence of a new variant: NB.1.8.1.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last week, the &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; designated NB.1.8.1 as a “&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants"&gt;variant under monitoring&lt;/a&gt;”, owing to its growing global spread and some notable characteristics which could set it apart from earlier variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what do you need to know about this new variant?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The current covid situation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than five years since covid was initially declared a pandemic, we’re still experiencing regular waves of infections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s more difficult to track the occurrence of the virus nowadays, as fewer people are testing and reporting infections. But &lt;a href="https://www.immunisationcoalition.org.au/news-data/covid-statistics/"&gt;available data&lt;/a&gt; suggests in late May 2025, case numbers in Australia were &lt;a href="https://www.immunisationcoalition.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MAIN-Aust-COVID-19-Stats-worksheet-2025.xlsx-18.pdf"&gt;ticking upwards&lt;/a&gt;. Genomic sequencing has confirmed NB.1.8.1 is &lt;a href="https://mike-honey.github.io/covid-19-genomes/output/Coronavirus%20-%20Genomic%20Sequencing%20-%20report%20Australia.pdf"&gt;among the circulating strains&lt;/a&gt; in Australia, and &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Documents/respiratory-surveillance-20250517.pdf"&gt;generally increasing&lt;/a&gt;. Of cases sequenced &lt;a href="https://mike-honey.github.io/covid-19-genomes/output/Coronavirus%20-%20Genomic%20Sequencing%20-%20report%20Australia.pdf"&gt;up to May 6&lt;/a&gt; across Australia, NB.1.8.1 ranged from less than 10% in South Australia to more than 40% in Victoria. Wastewater surveillance in Western Australia &lt;a href="https://www.health.wa.gov.au/articles/a_e/coronavirus/covid19-wastewater-surveillance"&gt;has determined NB.1.8.1&lt;/a&gt; is now the dominant variant in wastewater samples &lt;a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/public-health/covid-19-new-subvariant-nb181-driving-increase-in-infections-in-wa-c-18801659"&gt;collected in Perth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Internationally NB.1.8.1 is also growing. By &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;late April 2025&lt;/a&gt;, it comprised roughly 10.7% of all submitted sequences—up from just 2.5% four weeks prior. While the absolute number of cases sequenced was still modest, this consistent upward trend has prompted closer monitoring by international public health agencies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;NB.1.8.1 has been spreading particularly in Asia—it was the dominant variant in &lt;a href="https://github.com/neherlab/SARS-CoV-2_variant-reports/blob/main/reports/variant_report_latest_draft.md"&gt;Hong Kong and China&lt;/a&gt; at the end of April.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="align-right zoomable"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Where does this variant come from?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the WHO, NB.1.8.1 was first detected from samples &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;collected in January 2025&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a sublineage of the Omicron variant, descending from the recombinant XDV lineage. “&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/is-a-hybrid-covid-strain-behind-vietnams-latest-wave-not-exactly-161879"&gt;Recombinant&lt;/a&gt;” is where a new variant arises from the genetic mixing of two or more existing variants.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;What does the research say?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like its predecessors, NB.1.8.1 carries &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;a suite of mutations&lt;/a&gt; in the spike protein. This is the protein on the surface of the virus that allows it to infect us—specifically via the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-ace2-receptor-how-is-it-connected-to-coronavirus-and-why-might-it-be-key-to-treating-covid-19-the-experts-explain-136928"&gt;ACE2 receptors&lt;/a&gt;, a “doorway” to our cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;mutations include&lt;/a&gt; T22N, F59S, G184S, A435S, V445H, and T478I. It’s early days for this variant, so we don’t have much data on what these changes mean yet. But a &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.30.651462v1"&gt;recent preprint&lt;/a&gt; (a study that has not yet been peer reviewed) offers some clues about why NB.1.8.1 may be gathering traction.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Using lab-based models, researchers found NB.1.8.1 had the strongest binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor of several variants tested—suggesting it may infect cells more efficiently than earlier strains. The study also looked at how well antibodies from vaccinated or previously infected people could neutralise or “block” the variant. Results showed the neutralising response of antibodies was around 1.5 times lower to NB.1.8.1 compared to another recent variant, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/a-new-covid-variant-is-on-the-rise-heres-what-to-know-about-lp-8-1-253237"&gt;LP.8.1.1&lt;/a&gt;. This means it’s possible a person infected with NB.1.8.1 may be more likely to pass the virus on to someone else, compared to earlier variants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The evidence so far suggests NB.1.8.1 may spread more easily and may partially sidestep immunity from prior infections or vaccination. These factors could explain its rise in sequencing data.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;But importantly, the WHO has not yet observed any evidence it causes &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;more severe disease&lt;/a&gt; compared to other variants. Reports suggest &lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/new-covid-variant-nb-1-8-1-behind-surge-in-cases-recently-symptoms-associated-with-it/photostory/121373694.cms"&gt;symptoms of NB.1.8.1&lt;/a&gt; should align closely with other Omicron subvariants. Common symptoms include sore throat, fatigue, fever, mild cough, muscle aches, and nasal congestion. Gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur in some cases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How about the vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s potential for this variant to play a significant role in Australia’s winter respiratory season. Public health responses remain focused on close monitoring, continued genomic sequencing, and promoting the uptake of updated covid boosters.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Even if neutralising antibody levels &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.30.651462v1"&gt;are modestly reduced&lt;/a&gt; against NB.1.8.1, the WHO has noted current covid vaccines should still &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;protect against severe disease&lt;/a&gt; with this variant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most recent booster available in Australia and many other countries &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/new-covid-vaccines-may-be-coming-to-australia-heres-what-to-know-about-the-jn-1-shots-237652"&gt;targets JN.1&lt;/a&gt;, from which NB.1.8.1 is descended. So it makes sense it should still offer good protection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ahead of winter and with a new variant on the scene, now may be a good time to consider another covid booster &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/covid-19-vaccines/getting-your-vaccination"&gt;if you’re eligible&lt;/a&gt;. For some people, particularly those who are medically vulnerable, covid can still be a serious disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/lara-herrero-1166059"&gt;Lara Herrero&lt;/a&gt;, Associate Professor and Research Leader in Virology and Infectious Disease, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/griffith-university-828"&gt;Griffith University&lt;/a&gt;.

Conducted by TPE provider &lt;a href="https://www.circulate.health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Circulate Health&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, the single-blind human trial is believed to be the first to assess the rejuvenative potential of TPE using comprehensive molecular profiling. Participants who underwent biweekly TPE with IVIG demonstrated an average reduction in biological age of 2.61 years, outperforming the 1.32-year reduction observed in those receiving TPE alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Backed by Khosla Ventures, Circulate is building on &lt;a href="https://longevity.technology/news/be-part-of-bringing-plasmapheresis-to-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;research led by Dr Dobri Kiprov&lt;/a&gt;, a pioneer in therapeutic plasma exchange for aging. The company is led by co-founders Dr Brad Younggren and Dr Eric Verdin, who is also president and CEO of the Buck Institute, and its FDA-cleared TPE system is already used in more than 20 functional health clinics across the US.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In this study, we examined thousands of molecular signatures to pinpoint key drivers of rejuvenation,” said Verdin. “Our characterization builds a better understanding of which baseline biomarkers are predictive of treatment response and lays a foundation upon which we can build personalized intervention plans for patients in the future.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Longevity.Technology: TPE, also known as plasmapheresis, involves circulating a patient’s blood through an apheresis machine that separates and removes plasma before replacing it with a substitute such as albumin or donor plasma. This process is designed to eliminate disease-promoting substances like autoantibodies, inflammatory proteins or toxins, many of which accumulate with age and contribute to age-related conditions. Already well-established in the treatment of several autoimmune and neurological disorders, TPE is now being explored for its applications in aging and longevity science. To learn more, we sat down with Dr Matt Kaeberlein, CEO of &lt;a href="https://longevity.technology/news/we-want-to-help-people-add-10-20-years-of-healthspan/"&gt;Optispan&lt;/a&gt; and affiliate professor at the University of Washington, who recently joined Circulate’s Scientific Advisory Board.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A renowned aging researcher himself, Kaeberlein says his decision to get involved in Circulate was driven by the company’s scientific credibility and a growing personal conviction about the promise of the technology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" nitro-lazy-src="https://cdn-ilclkjd.nitrocdn.com/gGMFLmxRxYtlfrobExXMvPeqSnTPOgve/assets/images/optimized/rev-66d6e4e/longevity.technology/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/matt-kaeberlein-headshot-1024x683.jpg" class="wp-image-60084 nitro-lazy" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty id="NDQzODoyMzY=-1" src=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Matt Kaeberlein is the latest addition to Circulate Health’s Scientific Advisory Board.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The fact that Eric Verdin from the Buck Institute is a co-founder, and David Furman is involved gives me a lot of confidence that this is being approached from a scientifically rigorous perspective,” he says. “Eric and David are fantastic scientists – I have a ton of respect for them – and the fact that they’re doing these kinds of studies bears that out. So I have confidence that the company really is trying to do this in the right way.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kaeberlein ‘bullish’ on TPE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beyond the people involved, the growing body of scientific evidence supporting TPE’s potential also played a role in Kaeberlein’s decision.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Over the last 12 to 18 months, I personally have become much more bullish on the technology of therapeutic plasma exchange,” he says. “This comes in part from the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-024-00166-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;preclinical literature&lt;/a&gt; in laboratory animals showing that you can both increase lifespan and improve function in a variety of aged tissues and organs, and then the small but growing data from human studies and small clinical trials.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The recent trial studied 42 participants aged over 50 to explore how different TPE regimens affected biological aging markers across the epigenome, proteome, metabolome, glycome, and immune system. Physical function measures such as balance and strength were also included.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The study was primarily a safety evaluation, but also with the goal of looking at whether TPE can have effects on biological age clocks based on multi-omic types of data,” explains Kaeberlein. “I thought it was interesting that they tested both with and without intravenous immunoglobulin, and also the fact that they looked at multiple types of omics data instead of just using epigenetic clocks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="longe-caa9a2d998cc82f82096bad2d201a948 longe-content-middle" id="longe-caa9a2d998cc82f82096bad2d201a948"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TPE reduced biological age in all groups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study found that, among all treatment groups, TPE led to measurable reductions in biological age, with the most pronounced effects seen in the group receiving both TPE and IVIG. The combined treatment also restored immune cell profiles typically altered with age, modulated proteins associated with cellular senescence, and appeared to improve immune resilience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" nitro-lazy-src="https://cdn-ilclkjd.nitrocdn.com/gGMFLmxRxYtlfrobExXMvPeqSnTPOgve/assets/images/optimized/rev-66d6e4e/longevity.technology/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Circulate-Health-plasma-in-a-tube-1024x683.jpg" class="wp-image-60083 nitro-lazy" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty id="NDQ3NDoyNDU=-1" src=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A close-up on plasma running through Circulate’s TPE system. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There was evidence for improvements in a variety of these multi-omic biological age estimates – all consistent with the idea that therapeutic plasma exchange is moving biomarkers of health in the right direction,” says Kaeberlein. “And there was a trend that the IVIG added some value.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study found that individuals in poorer baseline health experienced the most significant benefits. Participants with elevated bilirubin, glucose, or liver enzyme levels saw larger decreases in biological age and improvements in their health markers. Even among healthier participants, the treatment yielded gains in physical performance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin are a powerful tool for biological age rejuvenation and provide compelling evidence that targeted plasma interventions can impact age-related molecular changes,” said Circulate CEO Younggren in a statement.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the data also indicated that the most substantial benefits occurred after the initial three treatment sessions, with subsequent rounds offering diminished returns. The researchers believe the pattern suggests future protocols might improve outcomes by adjusting treatment frequency or combining TPE with complementary therapies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;inflammation and neurodegeneration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kaeberlein was also careful to note the study’s limitations, including the small size of the cohorts, a point also noted by the study’s authors, who intend to expand the research to “larger populations.” And, while he says more research is needed to determine effect size, he adds that “the limited data that I’ve seen is suggestive that, at least in those populations who are likely to be strong responders, the effect size is significant.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it comes to the long-term potential of TPE, Kaeberlein is clearly optimistic, particularly in areas like chronic inflammation and neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m pretty bullish on the likelihood that some sort of therapeutic plasma exchange – perhaps in combination with IVIG, or even in combination with delivering other factors as part of the TPE – is likely to have health benefits, at least for a subset of people,” he says. “The people who are the most obvious candidates are those with high levels of chronic, sterile inflammation, or people who are either at high risk for dementia or who are already on that path with mild cognitive impairment.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, so convinced is Kaeberlein, that he is about to see for himself what TPE can deliver.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m actually going to be doing my first round of therapeutic plasma exchange on Wednesday of this week, and will be doing some biomarker comparisons before and after,” he says. “As someone who tends to be pretty conservative relative to some other people in this field about endorsing interventions, I would say I’m cautiously optimistic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="longe-64daebdcb906a59836eccd0c23228e72 longe-content-bottom" id="longe-64daebdcb906a59836eccd0c23228e72"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h6 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photographs courtesy of Circulate Health.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Longevity.Technology</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 14:35:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQMVVXR1ZjV0d6djk5Zmxla3VmVDVCdzBSNG5ubWdCdlNRcE5tZE9ITDl0WlNRV1VSZ0xkcVZNS0tBRDlnMGx1T3pQeHRyR0lwSDJEbXhhS2thMVZmbmZKa0RxZC1aS3VIcFRzQ0lHZXFkRDBGNU1sUGRTTTcwUTBqZ0J6d1VKSW13ZDJpVHhtZDVUdmJHeFN5ZTFWRFRtRU11bEtyVnEzbGNhcjTSAasBQVVfeXFMUDFVV0dWY1dHenY5OWZsZWt1ZlQ1QncwUjRubm1nQnZTUXBObWRPSEw5dFpTUVdVUmdMZHFWTUtLQUQ5ZzBsdU96UHh0ckdJcEgyRG14YUtrYTFWZm5mSmtEcWQtWkt1SHBUc0NJR2VxZEQwRjVNbFBkU003MFEwamdCendVSkltd2QyaVR4bWQ1VHZiR3hTeWUxVkRUbUVNdWxLclZxM2xjYXI0</guid></item><item><title>在瓦胡岛上发现寨卡病毒后，夏威夷游客指南-夏威夷节拍 | Guidance For Hawaii Visitors Following Zika Found On Oahu - Beat of Hawaii</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNRjFBbDNuZUVJckJhenVrRVNZTF83ODJZZk5WT2loTEY1LV9YMHVDRV84NjJGTnl4MVpTWGlsbGdnc0Z2WW8waUZDdmM5cWRnWS1fTkpwenRZS25UMnNBTmoyb1c0Und2WEdvU3c2cDlhVERnZzlFU25Hek9tcE9OOERVUjlWNTNuRjJR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content clear" ast-blocks-layout="true" itemprop="text"&gt;

Visitors heading to Oahu’s North Shore are being asked to take mosquito precautions as health officials respond." data-app-id-name="post_above_content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawaii health officials have just confirmed a travel-related case of Zika virus on Oahu—the first such detection in the state since 2019. While the virus was not contracted locally, the Department of Health is urging travelers to take precautions, especially on the island’s north shore in the Waialua and Haleiwa areas, where the infected individual spent time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vector control teams are actively working to prevent any potential mosquito-borne transmission. The state has not issued any restrictions, but the fact that visitors are mentioned in this alert is a reminder that visitors play a role in preventing the spread of mosquito-borne diseases in tropical destinations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-zika-virus-matters-for-hawaii-travelers"&gt;Why Zika virus matters for Hawaii travelers.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zika is primarily spread by mosquitoes. Most people infected do not experience symptoms, but the virus poses serious risks during pregnancy—including birth defects and other complications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises anyone pregnant or planning pregnancy to consult their doctor before traveling to areas where Zika has been identified. Hawaii is not classified as an outbreak zone, but the presence of the &lt;em&gt;Aedes&lt;/em&gt; mosquito in the islands means transmission could occur if precautions are ignored.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;State health officials confirmed that this is the first known Zika case tied to Hawaii travel in more than five years. During the 2015–2017 global Zika outbreak, Hawaii reported multiple travel-linked cases but avoided local spread. Officials hope to continue that record, with visitor cooperation being one key.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-the-zika-case-was-detected-in-hawaii"&gt;Where the Zika case was detected in Hawaii.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The individual who tested positive for Zika had visited Waialua and Haleiwa on Oahu’s North Shore. These beachside towns are popular with visitors seeking a quieter alternative to Waikiki, offering access to lush hiking trails among its other attractions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are no closures or travel advisories for the area, but mosquito mitigation teams are spraying and monitoring affected zones. The Department of Health says two other people may also have been exposed and are being evaluated at this time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although no locally transmitted Zika cases have ever occurred in Hawaii, health officials consider any confirmed case reason enough to increase public awareness—especially in places with high visitor traffic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-hawaii-travelers-can-reduce-mosquito-risk"&gt;How Hawaii travelers can reduce mosquito risk.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zika prevention is focused around avoiding mosquito bites. Hawaii’s Department of Health recommends taking steps for anyone spending time outdoors, particularly in North Shore communities or other warm, humid parts of the islands.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Use insect repellent approved by the EPA that contains DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535. Reapply as needed, especially after swimming or sweating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wear lightweight long sleeves and pants, even during the day. The mosquitoes that carry Zika are active in daylight hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stay in screened or air-conditioned accommodations. If not available, use mosquito nets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eliminate standing water at vacation rentals, including in buckets, planters, and even outdoor toys or gear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, travelers returning from an area with Zika risk—including Hawaii when travel-linked cases are active—should avoid getting bitten for at least three weeks to help prevent mosquito transmission back home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-if-you-have-any-symptoms-after-your-hawaii-trip"&gt;What if you have any symptoms after your Hawaii trip.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zika symptoms are typically mild and may include fever, rash, red eyes, muscle pain, joint pain, or headache. They usually last less than a week and are often missed or mistaken for other illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you develop any of these symptoms within two weeks of leaving Hawaii—or any destination where mosquito-borne viruses are possible—contact your doctor and mention your travel history. Testing is usually only done if symptoms are present.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though rare, Zika has been associated with serious complications like Guillain-Barre syndrome and other neurological issues. Awareness remains the best protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-north-shore-oahu-travel"&gt;What this means for North Shore Oahu travel.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, travel to Haleiwa and Waialua continues and should pose no issues. Visitors in the area are advised to take basic mosquito precautions, and those planning to visit soon should come prepared with repellent and protective clothing. Taking a few extra steps to prevent bites can help protect you and the islands from more serious consequences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remember that Hawaii has never had a locally transmitted Zika outbreak and that the Department of Health continues to respond quickly when travel-related cases are identified.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time the North Shore has seen enhanced vector control. It has happened during past alerts for dengue and other mosquito-related issues. Each time, Hawaii avoided wider spread, thanks in part to cooperation from visitors and residents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pregnant travelers or those with health concerns should consult the latest CDC guidelines and speak to a medical professional. For most others, a few mosquito precautions are all that’s needed to travel responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-if-you-re-traveling-to-hawaii-this-summer"&gt;If you’re traveling to Hawaii this summer.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And, especially to areas around Haleiwa, take a moment to at least think about mosquito protection. Beat of Hawaii editors will be on Oahu’s north shore in the next couple of weeks and will be doing the same thing. Pack what you need, stay aware, and help protect the islands by being part of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scientists still can’t explain why certain body parts like armpits and feet are more ticklish than others, despite over a century of research&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Your brain automatically cancels out tickling sensations when you touch yourself, but we can tickle others because their brains can’t predict our movements&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Tickling laughter is different from joy laughter—it may be more of a reflex response than genuine enjoyment, which explains why many people dislike being tickled but still laugh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NIJMEGEN, Netherlands —&lt;/strong&gt; Ever try to tickle yourself? Go ahead, stroke your own armpit or foot sole right now. Feel absolutely nothing? That’s because your brain is playing a fascinating trick on you — one that has stumped scientists for centuries and exposes surprising gaps in our understanding of human behavior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An extensive review published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt0350" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Science Advances&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; shows just how little we actually know about tickling, despite it being one of our most universal experiences. The research reveals that tickling remains largely understudied compared to pain, itch, and touch, even though brilliant minds like Socrates, Aristotle, and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/charles-darwin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Charles Darwin&lt;/a&gt; all theorized about it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Gargalesis, commonly known as tickle, is a very familiar sensation that most of us have experienced at least once in life. Whether actively tickling our babies, family, friends, partners, or pets, or being on the receiving end of a tickle attack, humans undoubtedly engage in tickling behaviors,” writes study author Konstantina Kilteni, a neuroscientist from Radboud University and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet “the scientific understanding of gargalesis is extremely poor,” she continues. “Today, we do not know why certain areas of the body are more ticklish than others and why some people enjoy being tickled, while others dislike it but still &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/laughter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;burst into laughter&lt;/a&gt;. We have also not fully understood why we cannot tickle ourselves and why some people are very ticklish, while others are not responsive at all. Furthermore, the primary function of tickling in humans, as well as in other species, remains a big enigma.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So why is this seemingly trivial knowledge necessary? Understanding tickling isn’t just scientific curiosity — it could reveal new information about autism, schizophrenia, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/children/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;child development,&lt;/a&gt; and even help design better robots that interact with humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Tickling is an age-old tactic that parents and grandparents alike use to get any child to start laughing. But why does it cause us to giggle so much? (Photo by Monkey Business Images on Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-scientists-can-t-even-agree-on-what-tickling-is"&gt;Scientists Can’t Even Agree on What Tickling Is&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Part of the confusion stems from basic definitions. Researchers can’t agree on what “tickling” actually means, leading to wildly contradictory study results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some scientists study light, feathery sensations that make you &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/scratching-skin-inflammation-fights-bacteria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;want to scratch&lt;/a&gt;, like when a bug crawls on your arm. Others focus on the harder pokes and prods that make you laugh and squirm away. These create completely different responses, yet both get called “tickling.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The light touch creates what researchers call “knismesis”—basically a moving itch that makes you pull away or scratch. But the laughing kind of tickle, which is what the term &lt;em&gt;gargalesis&lt;/em&gt; refers to, requires fast, strong, repetitive pressure on specific areas like the armpit, sides, or foot soles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studies have produced opposite findings because researchers weren’t even studying the same phenomenon. Some found forearms and thighs most sensitive to tickling, while others identified these same areas as least sensitive. The paper notes these results “can be conciliated if we consider that the former studies studied knismesis and the latter studied gargalesis.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-your-most-ticklish-spots-make-no-scientific-sense"&gt;Your Most Ticklish Spots Make No Scientific Sense&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nobody knows why certain body parts drive you crazy when touched. Your armpits and foot soles consistently rank as the most ticklish areas, but they’re not the most sensitive to regular touch or &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pain&lt;/a&gt;. They don’t have the thinnest skin or the highest concentration of nerve endings either.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One theory says these spots are vulnerable in combat — attacking someone’s armpit could damage major arteries, hitting the sides could harm internal organs. But this “warfare” explanation breaks down because our hands and arms are equally vulnerable yet not particularly ticklish.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Darwin proposed that we’re ticklish in places that don’t normally get touched by external sources. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/stinky-armpits-social-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Our armpits&lt;/a&gt; rarely encounter random objects, so when they do get touched, our brains pay special attention. But even Darwin admitted this theory had problems; our backs and buttocks also receive limited external contact but aren’t especially ticklish.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After more than a century of research, scientists still have no solid explanation for why your feet make you giggle while your hands don’t.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-brain-s-self-tickle-suppression-system"&gt;The Brain’s Self-Tickle Suppression System&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The strangest aspect of tickling is our complete inability to tickle ourselves. Scientists believe this happens because our brains predict and cancel out sensations we create ourselves. When you move your own hand to touch your body, your brain essentially says, “I know this is happening, so I’ll ignore it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brain imaging studies&lt;/a&gt; support this theory, showing reduced activity in touch-processing areas when people touch themselves versus when someone else touches them. The cerebellum, which helps predict movement consequences, becomes more active during self-touch, apparently working to suppress the sensation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But here’s the catch: all previous brain studies used non-ticklish touches or light stimulation. No one has actually scanned brains during proper tickling sessions, leaving this explanation somewhat speculative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Tickling might be a universally loved (or hated) activity, but scientists still don’t fully understand its purpose. (Photo by Halfpoint on Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-do-we-actually-enjoy-being-tickled"&gt;Do We Actually Enjoy Being Tickled?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tickling triggers laughter, which usually &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/happiness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;signals happiness&lt;/a&gt;, but many people report mixed or negative feelings about being tickled. Some studies found only one-third of participants enjoyed the experience, while others disliked it but still laughed uncontrollably.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research shows that tickling laughter sounds different from &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/laughter-hearing-left-side-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;joy laughter:&lt;/a&gt; it has different acoustic properties, creates higher emotional arousal, and activates different brain networks. This points to tickling triggering a reflexive response rather than genuine amusement, similar to how cutting onions makes you cry without actually making you sad.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not everyone responds to tickling equally either. Some people are extremely sensitive while others barely react at all. Children generally seem more ticklish than adults, though scientists aren’t sure if this reflects actual sensitivity differences or just behavioral changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/autism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;autism spectrum disorder&lt;/a&gt; perceive touches as more ticklish than others, and individuals with schizophrenia-related traits show reduced ability to distinguish their own touches from external ones — they can essentially tickle themselves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current tickling research faces enormous practical challenges. How do you standardize a human tickler? Different people apply different pressures, speeds, and techniques, making results nearly impossible to replicate. Studies suffer from small sample sizes, inconsistent methods, and unclear definitions of what they’re actually measuring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers argue that future studies need automated tickling machines to deliver consistent stimulation while measuring multiple responses simultaneously— self-reports, laughter recordings, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/heart-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart rate&lt;/a&gt; changes, and brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite two millennia of philosophical speculation and decades of scattered experiments, we’re still essentially clueless about one of humanity’s most common sensory experiences. Learning how our brains process and predict touch sensations could illuminate fundamental questions about consciousness, self-awareness, and sensory processing disorders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The field also has practical applications in developing touch-based technology and devices that could revolutionize how we interact with machines and each other remotely. Most importantly, tickling opens a unique window into how our brains distinguish between self and other, a crucial ability that appears disrupted in certain &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite centuries of inquiry, Kilteni says that “we are only at the very beginning of this journey” to understand why a simple touch can transform into uncontrollable laughter — except when we do it to ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This study was a comprehensive literature review rather than an experimental study. The researchers systematically analyzed existing scientific papers on tickling (gargalesis) to identify gaps in our understanding and methodological problems in previous research. They examined studies spanning several decades that used various approaches including behavioral observations, brain imaging, and physiological measurements. The authors identified major challenges in the field including inconsistent definitions of tickling, lack of standardized experimental methods, and small sample sizes in most studies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The review revealed that scientific understanding of tickling is remarkably limited despite centuries of philosophical interest. Key findings include: most studies fail to distinguish between different types of tickle sensations; there’s no consensus on why certain body areas are more ticklish; the neural mechanisms of tickling remain largely unknown; individual differences in tickle sensitivity are poorly understood; and the evolutionary function of tickling behavior is still debated. The authors identified five major unanswered questions about spatial specificity, emotional responses, self-tickle suppression, individual differences, and evolutionary function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since this was a review paper rather than original research, the limitations primarily concern the quality of existing studies analyzed. The authors noted that most tickling research suffers from small sample sizes, inconsistent experimental methods, unclear definitions of what constitutes tickling, and lack of standardized measurement techniques. Many studies used manual stimulation by humans rather than controlled mechanical devices, making results difficult to replicate. Additionally, most brain imaging studies examined non-ticklish touch rather than actual gargalesis sensations.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: The podcast Chasing Life With Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the medical science behind some of life’s mysteries big and small. You can listen to episodes &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.chtbl.com/_5Ghp6y2" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

            Who among us wouldn’t want to live a good life well into our 90s, especially if we could do it disease-free while still being as witty and spry as Betty White, as eloquent as Toni Morrison or as civically engaged as Jimmy Carter?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000j3b6m1lvdh8zy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But you’d need good genes to live that long, right?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000k3b6msisxvpj0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Not necessarily, according to Dr. Eric Topol, founding director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California, and former chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000l3b6mpag9mxcx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For almost 20 years, Topol has been studying a group of 1,400 Super Agers, or people who reached the age of 80 and beyond without developing one of three common, chronic, age-related conditions (cancer, heart disease and neurodegenerative disease), as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.scripps.edu/science-and-medicine/translational-institute/translational-research/genomic-medicine/wellderly/" target="_blank"&gt;Wellderly study&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000m3b6mqsd2vty0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To his surprise, when his team conducted whole-genome sequencing on all the Wellderly study participants, the researchers found nothing genetic, across the board, that conferred an age and health advantage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000n3b6mbhgp16gr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Topol’s new book, “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Agers-Evidence-Based-Approach-Longevity/dp/1668067668" target="_blank"&gt;Super Agers: An Evidence-Based Approach to Longevity,&lt;/a&gt;” explores the other factors at play and the science that backs them up. He examines lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise and sleep. He also looks at new technologies including the following :
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/list/instances/cmb70ih5k000t3b6m3miv974h@published" class="list-elevate vossi-list" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
  &lt;ul data-editable="items" class="list__items list__items--ul"&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.0.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            polygenic risk scores that sift through a person’s &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/Health/Genomics-and-Medicine/Polygenic-risk-scores" target="_blank"&gt;DNA to quantify disease risk&lt;/a&gt;;
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.1.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            the new science of “&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK202165/" target="_blank"&gt;omics&lt;/a&gt;” (for example, proteomics to analyze  the complete set of proteins expressed by a body) that can be used to produce organ clocks measuring how &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06802-1" target="_blank"&gt;fast our individual organs are aging&lt;/a&gt;; and
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.2.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            artificial intelligence to synthesize all available health data points.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000o3b6mpltt83b2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All these technologies show promise  in helping more people, if not reach Super Ager status, then achieve a longer health span by either delaying the onset of disease or aggressively treating conditions to prevent progression and complications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000p3b6mlzuq0b72@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Topol, who will soon turn 71, practices what he preaches.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000q3b6mja2pq84s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I hope to be (a Super Ager),” he told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, recently, on his podcast Chasing Life. &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;If I can get another 10 or 15 years without an age-related disease, that’d be great. And I’ve really doubled down on the things that I can do to help get there.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000r3b6m5bov8hs3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Exactly which steps has the doctor-scientist who studies Super Agers taken to increase his odds of reaching their ranks?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000s3b6mwz48va7n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            “I made extensive changes from the research, once we learned that it isn’t in your genes … to achieve healthy aging, free of cancer, free of cardiovascular disease and free of neurodegenerative disease,” Topol said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h3" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmb70sabr001y3b6mvm0ul65c@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="lessons-taken-to-heart-exercise-sleep-and-diet" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Lessons taken to heart: exercise,    sleep and diet
&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s100103b6mcp8hcpfs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the biggest changes Topol said he made was to his exercise routine. “I used to only do aerobic exercise, and as a cardiologist, that was my thing,” he said. “Now I do balance training and strength training (as well). It’s an extensive difference. … And so, I’m more strong and fit than I’ve ever been.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s200113b6mlf370zjq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In fact, exercise is so important that Topol ranks it as No. 1 on the list for anyone who wants to get started on the path of a longer life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s200123b6m0y9p5kt4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s free. And if you’re not doing anything, if you’re a sedentary, then start with walks, brisk walks if you can, and keep increasing it,” he said. “Challenge yourself (with) hills and pace … if you are working up a sweat, that’s a really good sign.” (Check with your doctor before starting any new exercise routine.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s200133b6m9k5mb66t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To get your upper body in shape, he recommends resistance bands, and to improve balance, he said to practice standing on one foot, then the other. “These are all free or cost minimum,” he said, noting that with a few inexpensive items you can do this at home, no gym membership required. “So work on that and then other things will start to fall in place. … If you exercise more, you’ll sleep better, too.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s200143b6mz7hofpf7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Which brings us to the next major change Topol made.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s200153b6metkizjyz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I realized how important (sleep) is because of ‘glymphatics.’ That was a new insight in the book: about deep sleep and getting these waste products out of your brain,” he said, referring to the recently discovered &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4636982/" target="_blank"&gt;glymphatic system&lt;/a&gt;, which helps flush out waste products in the brain and central nervous system, much like the lymphatic system does for the rest of the body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s200163b6mwu663meq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was a poor sleeper,” he confessed, so he worked “extensively” on improving the different factors that could impact it. “Things like … what do I eat? And when do I eat? Also hydrating, mostly early in the day … to have less interrupted sleep.” He added that for him fasting is “detrimental” to his sleep, as are both exercising or eating a big meal too late in the evening.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s200173b6m2if5s2lc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Agers-Evidence-Based-Approach-Longevity/dp/1668067668" target="_blank"&gt;do not give short shrift to sleep regularity,&lt;/a&gt; Topol advised. “I used to go to sleep all over the place (in terms of time), and now I’m very regimented, except for maybe one night a week,” he said, noting that this tweak was “phenomenally effective” in levelling up his sleep game.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s200183b6mt7wshe4t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As for diet, Topol (who hasn’t touched red meat in 40 years but does eat fish) said he wasn’t surprised the evidence showed that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/03/health/2025-best-diet-wellness"&gt;a plant-based diet with enough lean protein&lt;/a&gt; “prevailed as the best.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s200193b6m7fzf49to@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What was interesting, though, is how toxic (and) pro inflammatory &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/28/health/ultraprocessed-food-death-wellness"&gt;ultraprocessed foods&lt;/a&gt; were,” he said, adding that he does everything he can to minimize UPF — which he jokingly calls UFOs, or alien food . “It’s hard to get it to zero, but I’ve (made a) conscious effort.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001b3b6m3y0gclgy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Topol said he also increased his protein intake “some,” due to his age and because he started strength training, “but I don’t go to toxic levels that are advocated by others, that have no evidence (and) that are pro-inflammatory.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001c3b6mm93mif90@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He said he keeps protein to about 90 grams a day for his 180-pound (82-kilogram) frame, by adding nuts, legumes (including beans) and more fish, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/27/business/sardines-tinned-fish-recession-indicator"&gt;even canned tuna&lt;/a&gt; in water, to his diet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001d3b6mqgvmrg9r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I generally eat a salad every night,” he said. “Now I’m a little more conscious about having something with it. … But (it’s) not the protein craze that’s being advocated by some of the extremists.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  &lt;h3 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h3" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmb70sadk001z3b6mof4hu69q@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="supplements-alcohol-and-stress" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Supplements, alcohol and stress
&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001f3b6m1q4rj5ir@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What about supplements and vitamins? “I don’t rule out that they could help (if) you have a specific deficiency — if for some reason your vitamin D is very low, or your vitamin B12,” Topol said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001g3b6myx0lbxa8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But “for healthy people who are not symptomatic (and) who take good care of themselves,” he said, “there’s no data to show that these provide any benefit” much less an antiaging one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001h3b6mt2kpmd3r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think they’re a waste of money, and some of these supplements have potentially adverse effects,” he said. “It’s just infuriating because they’re not regulated, so (marketers) can say anything, and people believe it and buy it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001i3b6m6929cq62@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When it comes to &lt;a href="https://erictopol.substack.com/p/a-ground-truth-on-alcohol-intake" target="_blank"&gt;consuming alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, Topol said he keeps his drinking “light,” to fewer than seven drinks per week, after which the risks start adding up quickly. He said it doesn’t seem to affect his own sleep, but it might impact that of others, so he recommends watching out for that.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001k3b6mlv60ayhw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another top-of-the-list item: mental health and stress management. Topol mainly turns to exercise to help navigate both of these elements, but he said being out in nature is another often-overlooked route.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001l3b6muejyttgo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The nature prescription is part of the book. There really is something to this,” he noted, adding that he takes advantage of San Diego’s climate and location to do plenty of hiking and walking. “It’s good for mental health, it’s good for stress and anxiety, just to be out in our environment.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001m3b6m7xet5j99@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s never too late to start any or all of these lifestyle adjustments, Topol said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001n3b6mw4r65r8v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These diseases take 20 years at least (to develop). So, you get even more (bang) if you start in your 40s and 50s or 60s … but if you start when  you’re 70 (or) 80, you’re still going to derive years of healthy aging, maybe not quite as many, but still,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001o3b6mi2ujqt53@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And because these common, chronic, age-related conditions — cancer, heart disease and neurodegenerative diseases — do take so long to fully manifest, Topol said we have time to intervene to change their trajectory.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001p3b6mvxgbr1bk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But to fully leverage that  latency period before the symptoms of a disease appear, it’s important to be aware of personal risk, so people and their doctors (and society more broadly) can focus prevention and early detection efforts on the right people at the right time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001q3b6mco9etl5j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Knowing one’s risk — that’s the next part, which is: we’re going to prevent these three diseases in the future. We can now, and we’re going to even get better at that,” Topol said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001r3b6mr5ecws9z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Topol said he learned from his polygenic risk scores that he’s at high risk for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/about/coronary-artery-disease.html" target="_blank"&gt;coronary artery disease&lt;/a&gt;, despite not having a family history. So, he has focused on getting his LDL cholesterol down. “I’ve gotten it low, and perhaps I got more aggressive about that. I’ve checked my other lipids, like &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2024/lipoproteina-what-know-about-elevated-levels" target="_blank"&gt;Lp(a)&lt;/a&gt; (lipoprotein[a]), so I feel like I’ve done everything I can to go into high prevent-mode for that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001s3b6m07aqw23n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Topol said wants to get his &lt;a href="https://erictopol.substack.com/p/the-first-diagnostic-immunome" target="_blank"&gt;immunome&lt;/a&gt; (all the genes and proteins of his immune system) mapped, to measure how well his immune system is functioning. It’s a measurement he believes will one day soon be commonplace for everyone. He already has data on “every virus I’ve ever been exposed to and every autoantibody that I have.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001t3b6myao3pmxa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He also plans on having his organ clocks measured, because different organs (such as the heart and brain) age at different rates, putting people at higher risk for certain diseases. “I think it’s going to be very helpful, because then I’ll know (how) my heart organ clock correlates with my risk of heart disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001u3b6mff0g3bb0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “So those are some of the things I’ve done and/or I want to do,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001v3b6me41vm6m7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s an extraordinary time in medicine, because we have a path to prevention,” Topol said, “because of the way the science of aging (is developing), with these metrics like organ clocks and protein biomarkers and our genetics — all these layers of data — we are going to be able to prevent these diseases. And that’s exciting. We’ve never done that before.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

The researchers also found that certain genetic differences are associated with how much caffeine people drink and how sensitive they are to its effects. While caffeine use was not strongly linked to sleep satisfaction, people who said caffeine interfered with their sleep typically consumed less of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was designed to explore how caffeine consumption, sleep satisfaction, and psychological distress are connected in people with a history of depression, and whether genetic variants might explain some of these associations. Caffeine is the world’s most widely used psychoactive substance, often praised for its alertness-boosting effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at higher doses, or in sensitive individuals, caffeine can increase anxiety and interfere with sleep. Although research has shown that moderate caffeine use may reduce the risk of developing depression in otherwise healthy individuals, less is known about its effects in people who have already been diagnosed or treated for depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Caffeine is common, viewed as safe, and increasingly marketed toward and consumed by younger people,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harry-mcintosh-845a10298/"&gt;Harry McIntosh&lt;/a&gt;, a PhD student at the University of Queensland. “At the same time, mental health problems are on the rise and insomnia is an important symptom of a number of mental health disorders. We’re interested in caffeine consumption because it may be something that people suffering from mental health problems can change to improve their mental health and sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore these questions, the researchers used data from the Australian Genetics of Depression Study. Over 11,000 adults who had been diagnosed with or treated for depression completed detailed questionnaires about their caffeine consumption, sleep, and mental health. Of those, about 9,000 also provided DNA samples, allowing researchers to examine genetic differences previously linked to caffeine metabolism and sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine consumption was measured by asking participants how many servings of caffeinated coffee, tea, soft drinks, and energy drinks they typically drank per day. Participants were grouped into low (0–2 drinks), medium (3–5 drinks), or high (6 or more drinks) caffeine consumers. Psychological distress was assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, a commonly used measure of anxiety and depression symptoms. Sleep satisfaction was measured with a single question from the Insomnia Severity Index. Participants were also asked whether they felt caffeine interfered with their ability to sleep, which served as a proxy for caffeine sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then used linear regression models to examine how caffeine use was related to distress and sleep satisfaction, adjusting for factors such as age, sex, body mass index, and other substance use (including alcohol, nicotine, and painkillers). They also looked at whether specific genetic variants were linked to caffeine intake and sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis found that participants who drank six or more caffeinated drinks per day scored higher on the psychological distress scale than those who consumed fewer drinks. For each additional caffeinated beverage consumed per day, participants’ distress scores increased by 0.2 points on a 50-point scale. While this is a small effect, it was statistically significant. People in the medium caffeine group (3–5 drinks per day) did not differ significantly from those in the low group, suggesting that only higher levels of consumption are linked to greater distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, there was little evidence that caffeine consumption negatively affected sleep satisfaction in this group. Although those with higher caffeine intake reported slightly lower sleep satisfaction, the difference was small and did not remain statistically significant after correcting for multiple comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We expected caffeine consumption to be associated with poorer sleep, which it wasn’t,” McIntosh told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, caffeine sensitivity itself appeared to play a larger role. People who reported that caffeine interfered with their sleep were far less likely to drink large amounts of it. Each additional caffeinated drink consumed per day was associated with a 16% lower likelihood of reporting caffeine sensitivity. This suggests that people may naturally reduce their intake if they notice it disrupts their sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People naturally adjust how much caffeine they consume based on how they respond to it,” McIntosh said. “If caffeine was negatively impacting you, you’d probably reduce your intake accordingly, this could explain why caffeine was not associated with poor sleep quality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic analysis offered further insight into why some people consume more caffeine than others. Several genetic variants were associated with differences in caffeine intake. For example, a variant near the &lt;em&gt;AHR&lt;/em&gt; gene (rs4410790) was linked to increased caffeine use, while a variant near the &lt;em&gt;CYP1A2&lt;/em&gt; gene (rs2472297) was linked to lower consumption. These genes are involved in caffeine metabolism. People with faster metabolism may consume more caffeine to maintain the same level of alertness, while slower metabolizers may consume less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate variant near the &lt;em&gt;MMS22L/POU3F2&lt;/em&gt; genes (rs34645063) was associated with a higher likelihood of reporting caffeine sensitivity. This finding is consistent with earlier research showing that this genetic region may be linked to both lower caffeine consumption and increased sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other variants in genes like &lt;em&gt;ADORA2A&lt;/em&gt;—which encodes a receptor targeted by caffeine in the brain—were only weakly linked to consumption and did not remain significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Still, the results suggest that genetic differences play a role in shaping both how much caffeine people consume and how their bodies respond to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work is focused on those diagnosed with depression,” McIntosh told PsyPost. “Higher caffeine consumption was associated with higher reported levels of current stress in people regardless of sleep quality. The effect size was not large but was statistically significant. However, we cannot assign a causal relationship because participants may increase caffeine consumption in response to symptoms of depression such as fatigue or lack of motivation. Common genetic variants play a sizeable role in how our body handles caffeine and were associated with consuming a larger or smaller number of caffeinated drinks each day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the main strengths of the study is its large sample size and inclusion of genetic data, which allowed researchers to detect even small effects. However, there are some limitations to consider. The data were cross-sectional, meaning they captured only one moment in time. This makes it difficult to determine cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our data has only one timepoint and measures variables instead of controlling them experimentally, so we cannot use it to definitively state that caffeine is causing distress, or that people with higher stress are then choosing to consume more caffeine,” McIntosh noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another caveat is that the study sample consisted entirely of people with a history of depression. This means the results may not apply to the general population, especially those without mental health conditions. Future research using more precise measures of caffeine intake and longitudinal designs could help clarify how these relationships unfold over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1159/000545393" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Caffeine Consumption, Psychological Distress, and Insomnia in a Cohort of Individuals with Depression&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Harry A.

Choose nutrient-dense options or skip the snack if you’re not truly hungry.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you find yourself overdoing it on the p.m. snacking, then you may want to look at what you’re noshing on earlier in the day. Not eating balanced meals during the day can leave you feeling hungry. Ensuring that your meals include a mix of fiber-filled carbohydrates, healthy fats and lean protein can help you feel satisfied. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, mindless snacking at night can also be due to stress or some other cause. “Tuning into hunger cues is important while also knowing if it’s a habitual thing, boredom thing or true hunger,” says O’Donnell-Giles. If you choose to snack, consider it an opportunity to add nutrients to your diet that can help manage cholesterol. “Adding foods that are high in fiber, like oatmeal, whole grains, chia seeds, beans, fruits and veggies, can help lower cholesterol levels,” says&lt;a href="https://www.farmingtonvalleynutrition.com/about" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Amy Woodman, RD&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 2. Skipping Your Regular Bedtime &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Keeping a consistent bedtime routine isn’t just for kids—it benefits adults, too. An inconsistent sleep schedule can disrupt your circadian rhythm, which is detrimental to sleep quality.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This, in turn, can have a negative effect on cholesterol levels. “Sleep impacts cholesterol more than most people realize,” says O’Donnell-Giles, emphasizing that poor or inconsistent sleep can raise LDL cholesterol and lower HDL cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Not getting enough sleep can lead to increases in cortisol and inflammation, both of which can have negative impacts on cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Adequate sleep, along with a regular bedtime, helps regulate lipid metabolism and reduces inflammation,” says O’Donnell-Giles. Not getting enough sleep also disrupts hormones that regulate hunger and fullness, which can negatively affect food choices throughout the day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To combat these effects, find a bedtime that works for your schedule while also aiming for at least seven hours of sleep per night. Tips like avoiding screens in the few hours before bed and skipping large meals close to bedtime can help improve your sleep quality.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 3. Drinking Alcohol &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cutting back on alcohol can benefit your health, including your cholesterol levels. But if you choose to drink, know that &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; you drink also plays a role in managing your cholesterol. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking later in the day, especially within a few hours of bedtime, may help you fall asleep, but your overall quality of sleep could suffer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And we know falling short on quality sleep consistently can increase inflammation and cortisol levels, in turn, negatively affecting cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there’s no ideal time of day to drink alcohol to avoid these negative health effects, the late-night intake may be particularly bad for cholesterol for a variety of reasons. “Late-night alcohol can increase triglycerides, disrupt sleep and trigger poor food choices,” says O’Donnell-Giles. “I recommend limiting alcohol—especially at night—if you’re working to lower cholesterol.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead, try making a&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7967514/healthy-summer-mocktails-for-mocktail-summer/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; mocktail&lt;/a&gt; or&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/265887/lemon-cucumber-mint-infused-water/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt; infused water&lt;/a&gt; as a special drink, versus one that contains alcohol. Making this swap even a few nights per week can help improve your sleep quality while also lowering total calorie intake, particularly if you choose low- or no-added-sugar beverages in place of alcohol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 4. Eating Foods High in Saturated Fat and Added Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In general, it’s best to limit excess saturated fat and added sugar in the diet, especially if you are prioritizing heart health. Eating foods that are high in one or more of these nutrients later in the day can result in unintentionally adding excess calories, saturated fat and added sugar to your diet. “Unfortunately, the most common after-dinner snacks that people tend to reach for are chips or sweets that are often high in saturated fats,” says Woodman. Research indicates that eating later in the night leads to greater caloric intake overall and is associated with poor diet quality.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have high cholesterol, it’s best to skip fried foods, heavy fatty meals, sugary desserts, processed carbs and mindless snacking, says O’Donnell-Giles. “Focus instead on balanced, whole-food dinners with fiber, lean protein and healthy fats.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Managing your cholesterol requires making sustainable lifestyle changes. This includes changes to your nightly routine, like what and when you eat, as well as improving your sleep hygiene. “Focus on fiber, healthy fats (think avocados, nuts, olive oil), lean protein and whole grains,” says&lt;a href="https://www.nutritionbybess.com/old-about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Bess Berger, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you choose to snack late at night, stick to whole, nutrient-dense foods that are filling and satisfying. Get on a consistent schedule to promote healthy sleep habits. Berger recommends turning off electronics before bed and aiming for seven to nine hours of sleep per night. Remember, managing your health is a 24-hour job, and mixing up your nightly routine to better support your health will go a long way in helping you reach your long-term goals to feel your best.&lt;br&gt;

That number skyrocketed to 23,207 in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase is attributed to the rise in alcohol consumption and its established role as a carcinogen, contributing to various cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The more someone drinks both in volume and frequency, the higher the risk,” Moffitt Cancer Center epidemiologist Kathleen Egan stated. “When we drink, our bodies break down alcohol into acetaldehyde, a known carcinogen that can damage DNA. That damaged DNA can create mutations that can cause cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;For all the news that the Hudson Valley is sharing, make sure to follow &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/HudsonValleyPost"&gt;Hudson Valley Post on Facebook,&lt;/a&gt; and download the &lt;a href="https://hudsonvalleypost.com/app/"&gt;Hudson Valley Post Mobile App &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study says alcohol-related cancer deaths are seen the most in men aged 55 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;U.S. Surgeon General Warns About Link Between Alcohol and Cancer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a recent U.S. Surgeon General's advisory, alcohol is linked to &lt;a href="//hudsonvalleypost.com/?p=201148"&gt;100,000 cancer cases and 20,000 cancer deaths each year.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials note, alcohol is the third leading preventable cause of cancer in the United States, after tobacco and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization labeled alcohol a carcinogen in the late 1980s, saying that no amount is safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;LOOK: Counties with the highest cancer rates in New York&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-wrapper blog-photogallery "&gt;&lt;h2 class="photogallery-title"&gt;LOOK: Counties with the highest cancer rates in New York&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-description"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stacker.com/new-york" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Stacker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; ranked the counties with the highest cancer rates in New York using data from the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="photogallery-credit"&gt;Gallery Credit: Stacker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep Reading:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cancer Causing Chemicals Found In 37 Popular Food Items&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-wrapper blog-photogallery "&gt;&lt;h2 class="photogallery-title"&gt;Cancer Causing Chemicals Found In 37 Popular Food Items&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check the list below for food items and their total phthalates per serving according to a study from Consumer Reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="photogallery-credit"&gt;Gallery Credit: Jessica Poxson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7 Of The Most Dangerous Jobs In New York&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-wrapper blog-photogallery "&gt;&lt;h2 class="photogallery-title"&gt;7 Of The Most Dangerous Jobs In New York&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-description"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year, a lot of New Yorkers end up hurt or sick because of the work they do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zlotolaw.com/blog/seven-of-the-most-dangerous-professions-in-new-york/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zlotolow &amp;amp; Associates reports&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; that number grows into the thousands.

Positive confirmation of avian flu was received on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The affected poultry farm in this case, which was confirmed to be Hickman's Family Farms by the company itself, has been placed under quarantine, and measures were reportedly quickly put in place to eliminate the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eggs produced after the onset of clinical signs of illness have not entered the food supply, and there have been no signs of illness in humans. Consumers in Arizona and around the nation can remain confident in the safety and quality of eggs and egg products," agricultural officials say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the risk to the general public is considered to be low, with those most at risk of exposure being individuals who are directly involved with the daily care of birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is reportedly the second commercial farm located in Maricopa County with poultry that tested positive this month. ABC15 has not confirmed the name of the second location.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.abc15.com/news/region-west-valley/buckeye/help-on-the-way-for-arizona-egg-farmer-getting-shelled-by-bird-flu"&gt;ABC15 reported on cases of avian flu at Hickman's&lt;/a&gt;. At that point, the farm said it had lost more than one million egg-laying hens (20% of its flock) at one of its farms due to the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;See coverage from February 2025 in the video player below:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="VideoEnhancement" data-video-disable-history&gt;

From stoplights to traffic jams to honking horns, there’s lots to consider when buckling your seat belt and hitting the gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while distracted driving is a danger for absolutely everyone, people with ADHD may have more to contend with when it comes to operating a vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-driving-risks-research-safety/?srsltid=AfmBOooHJHLwO3W4bJT9yMT5d76Y9Zv-NsMlH8Xt3g0kAq35sRXvC-Hk" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Research" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6830a438e4b0a3c83b17f365" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-driving-risks-research-safety/?srsltid=AfmBOooHJHLwO3W4bJT9yMT5d76Y9Zv-NsMlH8Xt3g0kAq35sRXvC-Hk" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; says &lt;a href="https://injury.research.chop.edu/blog/posts/examining-how-and-why-teens-adhd-crash" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="that people" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6830a438e4b0a3c83b17f365" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://injury.research.chop.edu/blog/posts/examining-how-and-why-teens-adhd-crash" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;that people&lt;/a&gt; with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder &lt;a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/news/research-shows-strong-link-between-adhd-car-crashes-older-adult-drivers" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="are more likely" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6830a438e4b0a3c83b17f365" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/news/research-shows-strong-link-between-adhd-car-crashes-older-adult-drivers" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;are more likely&lt;/a&gt; to get in a car crash that’s their fault — and to get traffic tickets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of reasons this happens, and a lot of it has to do with the sheer number of distractions that can occur while driving. But experts say this research shouldn’t discourage folks with ADHD, particularly those who manage their diagnosis well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, experts share what you should know about this research and what drivers who have trouble focusing should do to stay safe on the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People with ADHD are at a higher risk of car accidents because of increased distractions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you do a research study where you look at 1,000 people with ADHD, and you compare them to 1,000 people who are perfectly matched in every way except they don’t have the ADHD diagnosis and then you follow them, and you look at the rate of car accidents, you’ll see that the rate of car accidents, most likely, is increased in the people with ADHD in that group of 1,000 people a little bit,” said &lt;a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=18679" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Will Cronenwett" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6830a438e4b0a3c83b17f365" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=18679" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Dr. Will Cronenwett&lt;/a&gt;, the vice chair for clinical affairs in the department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Northwestern University in Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://injury.research.chop.edu/blog/posts/examining-how-and-why-teens-adhd-crash" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Research in teenagers" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6830a438e4b0a3c83b17f365" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://injury.research.chop.edu/blog/posts/examining-how-and-why-teens-adhd-crash" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Research in teenagers&lt;/a&gt; found that those with ADHD had a 9% higher chance of getting into a car accident that was their fault. Inattentive behavior was the top reason for accidents, while another reason was driving at an unsafe speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why might this be? According to &lt;a href="https://www.jackiemorrisonlmft.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Jackie Morrison" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6830a438e4b0a3c83b17f365" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.jackiemorrisonlmft.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Jackie Morrison&lt;/a&gt;, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Minnesota, the ADHD brain filters information in a different manner than a neurotypical brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is known to &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/adhd-signs-women_l_663cd48de4b0fe081b305083" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="cause trouble focusing and inattention" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6830a438e4b0a3c83b17f365" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="663cd48de4b0fe081b305083" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;cause trouble focusing and inattention&lt;/a&gt; in folks with the disorder, which can, of course, also lead to trouble on the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is, in a lot of cases, a truly different amount of information that is coming in. And your brain isn’t filtering out as many distractions,” explained Morrison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And so things that an ADHD brain is picking up on might be significantly more than a neurotypical brain, and so there are literally more distractions sometimes for an ADHD brain,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an ADHD brain, you need more stimulation and engagement to get your brain in the “task-positive network,” said Morrison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The task-positive network is the grouping of your brain systems that turn on and activate when you’re engaged in a task and helps you focus,” she added. If there isn’t enough stimulation, which can happen when you’re driving, your brain isn’t going to go in this network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But that doesn’t mean an individual with ADHD should be nervous about driving.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both experts stressed that these research findings don’t mean that individual ADHD drivers are any worse than other drivers on the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can say on a population level that ... having a disorder that impairs your attention does increase the risk for driving accidents in that population, but you can’t say anything about a particular individual,” Cronenwett noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meaning, someone with an ADHD diagnosis who manages their ADHD properly can be a safer driver than someone without ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would caution against people looking at the ADHD label as either a flag for ‘now I’m at risk’ versus not at risk,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because people with ADHD can be very well-treated, and their symptoms can be under control, and they can be quite safe,” explained Cronenwett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distracted driving, in general, can lead to traffic incidents.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because someone doesn’t have ADHD doesn’t mean they’re a safe driver by default. There are plenty of other distractions — cellphones, other passengers, day-to-day stress, exhaustion and more — that can put anyone at a higher risk of an accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, “people won’t be able to pay as good attention to the road when they are fatigued,” said Cronenwett. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/drowsy-driving" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6830a438e4b0a3c83b17f365" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/drowsy-driving" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&lt;/a&gt;, 633 car crashes happened as a result of drowsy driving in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, I wouldn’t want people to just look at the [ADHD] diagnosis as if that determines whether they are at risk at any particular given moment,” noted Cronenwett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Alvaro Medina Jurado via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Alvaro Medina Jurado via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Distracted driving, overall, is dangerous.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instead of focusing on your diagnosis before you start driving, focus on how you feel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before getting in your car, take note of how you’re feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you tired? Are you distracted because of an argument with your partner? This way, you can decide if you have the faculties to safely operate your car. And this is true for anyone — not just those with ADHD, said Cronenwett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any number of things influence somebody’s risk more than just the strict presence or absence of a label,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t feel focused enough to drive, don’t do it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think we can all agree that distracted drivers, or inattentive drivers, are at risk for having car crashes, and they should certainly be very, very careful in their own driving habits,” said Cronenwett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, people can be distracted because they’re tired, because of stressful social situations or even from depression and anxiety, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, any type of inattentive or distracted driving puts somebody at risk,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have an ADHD diagnosis and want one, Morrison said it could be a good idea to find a doctor or therapist in the field who has an understanding of ADHD and can help you learn more about how your brain works so you can efficiently and safely move through the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people who can’t get diagnosed because of a lack of insurance coverage, long appointment wait times or for whatever reason, Morrison recommends mindfulness as a way to combat distractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Be aware of your body in space and your breath for a few minutes at a time, and let thoughts move in and out ... you’re just experiencing what it’s like to be in your body at that moment in time. [It] can be really helpful because it gives your brain a chance to run around off its leash, if you will, and it also gives you practice being present without distracting yourself and without stimulation,” Morrison noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And when you’re driving, it can be boring — so, basically you’re practicing getting bored,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can also be helpful to train your brain to move slower, said Morrison — “because the ADHD brain wants to go fast and it wants to be efficient, even though, arguably, it can be very inefficient at times.” Instead of rushing to prep food or unpack your groceries, take your time while doing it, said Morrison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[This] can be helpful just to help your body become more comfortable with that inefficiency or that slowness,” Morrison noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your body and brain want to move fast, and that’s not always the safest option when driving, so you’re literally helping your body to practice being slow and inefficient, to just get used to that discomfort,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

It came with bright packaging and even brighter promises. But now, science seems to be rewriting that story. New research from Brigham Young University (BYU) and German institutions has cast a careful light on fruit juice, suggesting that this popular ‘healthy drink’ might not be so harmless after all, especially when it comes to the risk of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Here’s all we need to know about what the study found, and look at some truly nourishing substitutes that could be better for metabolic health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The old belief: Fruit juice equals good health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, fruit juice has enjoyed a healthy reputation. After all, it's made from fruits. It’s full of vitamins, especially vitamin C, and it feels like a cleaner, more natural choice compared to fizzy drinks. No wonder it's a staple in breakfast spreads, children's tiffin boxes, and fitness cafés.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here’s the catch, most fruit juices lack the very thing that makes whole fruits so beneficial: fibre. Plus, what gets left behind is sugar, a lot of it, in liquid form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The new reality: Juice and diabetes risk, what the study says&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent BYU-led &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831325000493?via%3Dihub" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, is one of the most detailed meta-analyses ever conducted on this topic. Researchers tracked data from over 500,000 individuals across various countries. Their goal was simple: understand how different forms of sugar affect diabetes risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Here’s what they found:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every additional 230ml serving of fruit juice per day was associated with a 5% increase in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, sugar-sweetened beverages like soda raised the risk by 25% per 350ml serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural sugars eaten in foods like fruits or dairy didn’t carry the same risk, and sometimes, were linked with lower diabetes risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message? Drinking sugar, even if it’s from juice, hits the body harder than eating it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why drinking sugar is more dangerous than eating it&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When sugar is consumed through drinks, it rushes into the bloodstream quickly, triggering a spike in blood glucose. This sudden overload can overwork the liver and disrupt insulin sensitivity, both red flags for type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole foods, on the other hand, deliver sugars in a package that includes fibre, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. This slows down digestion, keeps glucose levels more stable, and prevents that sugar "rush" that overwhelms the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, while fruit juice may have originated from a good place — the fruit itself — the journey it takes before reaching the glass removes much of what made the fruit healthy in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Here are some smart swaps that can be refreshing and gentle on blood sugar:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Whole fruit smoothies (with pulp and fibre intact)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of juice, blending whole fruits, skin, pulp, and all, helps retain fibre, which slows down sugar absorption. Toss in a spoonful of chia seeds or flaxseeds for a bonus dose of healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Infused water with herbs and fruits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slices of cucumber, lemon, berries, or mint can turn plain water into a delicious drink. It looks vibrant, tastes refreshing, and doesn’t bring any sugar shock with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Unsweetened coconut water&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally hydrating and rich in potassium, this is a great alternative — but in moderation. It still contains natural sugars, though far less concentrated than juice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Vegetable-based juices (Like cucumber or spinach)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are low in sugar and high in micronutrients. Adding a pinch of black salt or lemon juice can elevate the taste without any sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Diluted amla or aloe vera juice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These have been used in traditional practices for gut and metabolic health.

Of course, it’s not only Ozempic that’s creating fragile, crepe paper-like skin on body parts everywhere. There’s the rise of “&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/how-to-treat-neck-wrinkles" target="_blank"&gt;tech neck&lt;/a&gt;” to consider, and other causes that far predate laptops and smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vogue&lt;/em&gt;’s Favorite Crepey Skin Treatments:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Crepey skin is the result of both natural aging and external factors. Over time, our skin loses collagen and elastin, becomes thinner, and is less able to repair itself,” says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://hunzahealthspan.com/pages/whitney-tolpinrud-md-faad" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://hunzahealthspan.com/pages/whitney-tolpinrud-md-faad"}' href="https://hunzahealthspan.com/pages/whitney-tolpinrud-md-faad" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Whitney Tolpinrud, MD, FAAD&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified dermatologist and medical director at Agency by Curology. She adds that sun exposure plays a major role in the development of crepey skin, as do hormonal shifts, oxidative stress, and environmental damage. So, how does one keep it tight?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Effective treatments for crepey skin are available both at home and in the office,” says Tolpinrud.

Either condition of cell inactivity or death is thought to contribute to aging and age-related diseases.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The researchers found that vitamin D supplementation helped minimize telomere shortening in white blood cells, which could help slow down biological aging.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this study, researchers used data from the &lt;a href="https://www.vitalstudy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;VITAL trial&lt;/a&gt;. This trial included a representative sample of adults in the United States who received vitamin D3 supplements, omega-3 fatty acid supplements, or both for around five years. It was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, so some participants received the supplements while others received the placebo. All female participants were at least fifty-five years old, and all male participants were at least fifty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This data specifically examined a cohort that visited the Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Centre. At baseline and follow-up visits, participants participated in in-person assessments and provided fasting blood samples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined telomere length in &lt;hl-trusted-source source="National Cancer Institute " rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/leukocyte" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;leukocytes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, which are the body’s white blood cells, among participants who received supplements and those who received the placebo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers were able to analyze over 2,500 samples from over 1,000 participants. They examined telomere length at baseline and at two- and four-year follow-up, though some data was missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They conducted a statistical analysis using models to adjust for various covariates. They also did an exploratory subgroup analysis to see how different factors, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, impacted results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vitamin D vs. omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from a higher body mass index in the omega-3 fatty acid supplement group, the placebo and intervention groups had similar baseline characteristics. Missing data was also similar between the two groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin D appeared to have a positive impact on telomere length. Among participants who received vitamin D, there was only minimal shortening of telomere length at two and four years. In contrast, there was substantial telomere shortening in the placebo group at both time points. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids supplementation appeared to have no significant impact on telomere length. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subgroup analysis further suggested that the effects of vitamin D on telomere length were significant for participants not taking medication for cholesterol, but not for participants who were taking cholesterol medication. Vitamin D also minimized telomere shortening at a statistically significant level for non-white participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no significant interaction with body mass index, but researchers did observe that participants who were not obese had significantly minimized telomere shortening. Also, taking omega-3 fatty acid supplements did not appear to impact the role of vitamin D on telomere length. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This analysis of telomere length in this study population does have some limitations. First, most participants were white, and all participants were at least fifty, so it may not be possible to generalize the findings to other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers acknowledge that this was a post-hoc analysis of an already completed study and that the study was not originally designed to look at the effects of supplements on leukocyte telomere length. The analysis also excluded participants who did not have data on leukocyte telomere length. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that unaccounted-for factors influenced the results, and the study also has any other limitations found in the original study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding exploratory subgroup analysis results, researchers encourage caution, note limited power, and say people should look at the data as “hypothesis-generating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After four years, there were about 37% missing cases. Researchers acknowledge that this reduced power and could be why they did not find omega-3 fatty acid supplementation affected leukocyte telomere length. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research can explore why vitamin D may have these effects on telomere length. For example, it could be related to an enzyme called telomerase that helps to lengthen telomeres and how vitamin D may protect against DNA damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutler also noted the following limitations of the study: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The present study involved only a relatively small number of people, looked only at telomeres in white blood cells, and did not look extensively at the health impact of these telomere changes. So, the clinical implications one can derive from this study are quite limited.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study suggests the potential benefits of vitamin D in relation to aging. The authors suggest that the preservation of telomere length in this study “could mean a 3-year decrease in aging.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“As we know already, vitamin D supports bone, immune system and reduces inflammation, but this study is linked directly with telomere preservation which ties into aging and disease prevention. This [study] gives more of a general idea that vitamin D3 could do more than just helping your bones but actually slowing down the cellular age, impressive!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If this is confirmed in future studies, this could mean that daily [vitamin D} supplements could actually help reduce risks for age-related diseases. This is a door for new medical guidelines in the future and will be a huge deal for preventive medicine.”&lt;br&gt;— Yoshua Quinones, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it’s also important to note the potential risks of vitamin D supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While 2,000 units of vitamin D is unlikely to have any negative effects, there may be some risk to vitamin D supplements as they can cause kidney damage and other adverse effects in excessive quantities. Since vitamin D is fat soluble, it can accumulate in our bodies, causing toxicity. So, any potential, as yet unproven benefits of vitamin D need to be weighed against its known risks,” Cutler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 10:27:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxPYzVkcmoyRE5vcmFDdVdTNENLOTJDclZ6UV9QS1RGUEg4b1hKXzJNbThTM0dLaUZNU002TXBZbGV3d1M0ZDVudkhmUjhtaC1FVmVzQm4yTU1fTEY4QjlNUVFnbmQ4d2hkVS16WDZvZl9Cb19mUVFZQUlIWl9NcWhuWUFQalpTRzFZQ05Udjhxd3Y2ZmN3QWpmalVZb2xJX0loQ045dm9VdUZxQ2Z5b1MwcHJIZkk</guid></item><item><title>为什么36至46岁对您的健康来说是最关键的十年-《每日电讯报》 | Why 36 to 46 is the most critical decade for your health - The Telegraph</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOWFhMTXpSSVd5ZWdHSkZMSEZBdVUyRjZZazl4ck1wWHJsTWgyYXNJeVl3YzFIUlhxeWxqNU4wR2RwNnZzN0hqNDdzS1VjM3h2eF9EQzB3TllMTE10amJaNDg0MXRGZGNkU1F0WnFUUng4TWpNR3FsZ2lxd3NBSGdaLURqZzF0MG4zcU5R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;p&gt;For many of us, our 20s are a decade of hedonism – of giving barely a passing thought to our health. It’s the era where we chain smoke, binge drink and shun exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But new &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07853890.2025.2479233" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that by their mid-30s, this kind of party lifestyle will take its toll. Researchers in Finland found there were relatively few consequences to &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/alcohol/alcohol-gut-microbiome/"&gt;heavy drinking&lt;/a&gt; and smoking in people’s 20s, but those who continued these habits found their health begin to deteriorate at 36. Over the course of their lifetime, they were found to result in a plethora of health problems including higher rates of depression, cancer, heart disease, lung disease and early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the decade from 36 to 46 is a pivotal one for our future wellbeing. “What you do in that window shapes the health you’ll experience in the decades to come,” says Dr Philip Borg, an NHS oncologist and founder of The Longevity Doctor, a clinic specialising in preventative medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Accumulative damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s in our mid to late-30s that we stop “getting away” with unhealthy behaviour, as the cumulative effects of our lifestyle begin to show their impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chronic diseases are caused by long-term, silent processes like inflammation, triggered by habits including poor diet, stress, drinking, smoking and lack of exercise, which can slowly damage your cells, arteries and brain, starting decades before symptoms appear,” says Dr Borg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to this age, much of the damage can be undone – for instance, people who quit smoking by the age of 35 were shown in a 2022 &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2797597" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of half a million Americans to have a similar long-term mortality risk to people who have never smoked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/decline-in-lung-cancer-greatest-modern-medical-achievement/"&gt;rates of lung cancer&lt;/a&gt; caused by smoking begin to rise steadily in the 40-44 age range, steadily for women and more rapidly for men, according to Cancer Research UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my clinic, I frequently see patients who wish they’d stopped habits like smoking earlier,” says Dr James Wilson, a consultant clinical oncologist at UCLH. “Age 36-46 is when we start to see patients developing conditions such as cancer, which could have been avoided with lifestyle changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because the damage to within our cells builds up increasingly quickly from this age onwards. “&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/ageing/senescent-cells/"&gt;Senescent cells&lt;/a&gt; are ones which have stopped dividing but are still active, and create an inflammatory environment which damages neighbouring cells,” explains Dr Borg. “The more unhealthy your lifestyle, the more of these cells you accumulate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol consumption is linked to seven types of cancer, including breast and bowel, with 17,000 cases of cancer attributed to alcohol every year in the UK. Again, its impact increases past the age of 35, as our ability to metabolise it decreases and the damage it causes to the liver accumulates, putting us at increased risk of liver disease, heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/diabetes/body-type-2-diabetes-symptoms-risk/"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once you’ve exposed your body to excessive drinking during this decade, you can’t reverse the risk,” says Dr Wilson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;A decade of change&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decade from 36 to 46 is a time in which women in particular, but also men, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/sex/why-your-sex-drive-changes-every-stage-of-life/"&gt;go through vast hormonal changes&lt;/a&gt;, which play a major role in our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For women, oestrogen and progesterone begins to decline as menopause approaches. “This affects everything, from a decrease in muscle mass and bone density, to lower immunity and our ability to process sugar and fats,” says Dr Harpal Bains, a longevity specialist and the medical director at Harpal Clinic. It also increases women’s risk of diseases including &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/bones-joints/early-warning-signs-osteoporosis/"&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;, heart disease, diabetes, depression, obesity and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men’s testosterone levels peak in their early 30s and begin to drop after that. A recent &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00692-2"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from Stanford University revealed a similar spike in age-related issues among men in their 40s, including weaker bones and poorer metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;

They are normally found inside tumors, trying to eliminate cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When cancer cells grow and multiply, they can overcome these cells, keeping them from effectively performing their cancer-fighting role. The goal of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapy, or TIL therapy, is to get rid of the cancer cells by blocking the bad cells and unleashing immune cells from the patient's own body to attack the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In June 2024, shortly after Konkol received his cancer diagnosis, the Froedtert &amp;amp; MCW Cancer Networkbecame the only center in the state certified and one of 80 approved centers nationwide to provide &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-grants-accelerated-approval-lifileucel-unresectable-or-metastatic-melanoma" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;lifileucel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The drug is manufactured by &lt;a href="https://www.iovance.com/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Iovance Biotherapeutics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Froedtert &amp;amp; MCW were involved in the phase two clinical trials, with three patients receiving the treatment. Konkol is the first patient to receive the treatment in Wisconsin who is not involved in a clinical trial. Two others have since received treatment, with a third scheduled to begin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Patients like Konkol who qualify for the therapy must first undergo seven consecutive days of chemotherapy, similar to what is done to patients prior to a bone marrow transplant, said Harker-Murray, who oversaw the drug's clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“The goal of that chemotherapy is to clear out a patient's immune cells within their own body and bone marrow to make room for the TIL product,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Once the seven days of chemotherapy are completed, the patient is admitted to Froedtert's bone marrow transplant unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Then, similar to a blood transfusion, a newly grown batch of the patient's own lymphocytes is infused back into the patient's bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Once the infusion is completed, the patient is transferred to the intensive care unit and given up to six doses of a hormone that spurs the growth of the lymphocyte cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Once they are in the bloodstream, they just know what to do," Harker-Murray said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If all goes as planned, the robust number of newly grown lymphocytes will overpower the cancer cells, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;The patient experience&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Cancer patients must meet certain criteria to be a candidate for the therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;They need to have stage 4 cancer or a tumor that cannot be completely removed by surgery that has progressed, despite receiving chemotherapy and immunotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Candidates cannot have active, untreated spots of brain cancer. They need to pass a pulmonary test and a cardiac stress test if they have had prior heart issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;And the pace at which their cancer is spreading can’t be too quick, Harker-Murray said, since the process takes two to three months, including the time for the drug manufacturer to grow the new, healthy cancer-fighting cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Candidates must also have one melanoma spot at least 1.5 to 4 cm in size to take to remove as a lymph node sample and at least one other spot of cancer visible on a CT scan, which allows doctors to monitor the therapy’s effectiveness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Konkol met the criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Patients have to stay relatively close to the hospital during the first 28 days, as patients experience the standard chemotherapy side effects that follow a bone marrow transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Konkols decided the best option for them was to stay at &lt;a href="https://kathys-house.org/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Kathy's House&lt;/a&gt; for most of Rusty's care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Located one block from the hospital's cancer clinic, the facility allows patients of all ages who are receiving treatment at a nearby hospital to stay for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Meals are provided and some insurances cover the cost to stay. Otherwise, a one bedroom is $50 per night and a two-bedroom suite is $60. Financial assistance is available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Kathy's House is a godsend," Lynn Konkel said. "It made our lives so much easier to even survive this ordeal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;They stayed 36 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/20/PMJS/83737644007-cancer-treatment-0159.JPG?crop=5583,3986,x116,y393&amp;amp;width=660&amp;amp;height=472&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/20/PMJS/83737644007-cancer-treatment-0159.JPG?crop=5583,3986,x116,y393&amp;amp;width=1320&amp;amp;height=944&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Rusty Konkol becomes emotional as he discusses his cancer journey with his wife Linda after an appointment at the Clinical Cancer Center at Froedtert Hospital Campus in Milwaukee, April 23, 2025.

Carbohydrates replenish your body’s glycogen stores and help your body use protein to build muscle, she added. But you should avoid bars that are loaded with added sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JJ37L5SL6FGXHPEVPG6C7G5IU4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As a general rule, look for bars that have an added sugar content that is less than half the total amount of carbs, Stephens said. If a bar has 20 grams of carbs, for example, then it should contain less than 10 grams of added sugar.

In many cases, these bars are made with artificial sweeteners and other sugar substitutes. “If a protein bar has one gram of sugar but it’s loaded with artificial sweeteners then I would not consider that healthier than a protein bar that has just a little honey or dates in it for sweetness,” said Zumpano at the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZA7555TYCNESTGPN26NOVJFP3U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The amount of sugar you’d be cutting from your diet is likely minimal anyway, and research suggests that sugar substitutes may&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;have surprising side effects. Some have been &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/46/9/1681/153434/Artificial-Sweeteners-and-Risk-of-Type-2-Diabetes" target="_blank"&gt;linked to an increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, said Allison Sylvetsky, an associate professor of exercise and nutrition sciences at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. “That raises the question of whether they really are helpful or not,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TGUKWMPMPVAIXGNJWPUFMJYHJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Common sugar substitutes in protein bars include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="2NWJO3P6YZE2DGG3754LUJEZBM" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sugar alcohols&lt;/b&gt; such as erythritol, maltitol, xylitol and sorbitol.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Artificial sweeteners&lt;/b&gt;  such as sucralose, aspartame, saccharin and acesulfame potassium.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Natural” sweeteners&lt;/b&gt; such as stevia, allulose and monk fruit extract. These low and no-calorie sweeteners are derived from plants, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re better for you, Sylvetsky said. “There’s a consumer perception that they’re healthier because they’re from plants,” she added. “But there’s not much evidence to support that.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="FQJDFY5AP5E4VC2YI7UW2C7DQE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="FQJDFY5AP5E4VC2YI7UW2C7DQE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How to pick a healthier protein bar&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="SWZZ3HQ3VZBQRNUFSNJ3AT4JOA" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;High quality protein&lt;/b&gt;: Look for proteins such as egg whites and dairy, which may be listed as casein or whey protein. “These contain all the essential amino acids that your body can’t make and that you need for muscle growth,” Stephens said. If you’re vegan, look for plant proteins like soy and pea protein. “These are also great sources of protein,” she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;At least 10 grams of protein&lt;/b&gt;: Choose bars that have between 10 and 20 grams of protein. “That’s a decent amount,” Zumpano said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fiber&lt;/b&gt;: Eating fiber &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/09/17/secrets-to-successful-weight-loss/" target="_blank"&gt;helps keep you full&lt;/a&gt; and satiated, and it nourishes your gut microbiome. Look for bars that have about 3 to 5 grams of fiber per serving, Zumpano said. But the more the better. “If a bar has more than 5 grams of fiber, that’s great,” she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whole food ingredients&lt;/b&gt;: Choose bars that are made from “real food” ingredients such as oats, seeds, egg whites, dates, almonds and peanuts. “The ingredients should be things that you can pronounce and recognize,” Stephens said. “If you’re not really sure what an ingredient is, it’s likely something that’s highly processed and that might not be good for your health.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="BL7XOAKGHVEIXJEWBSFYG5EXXU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-ieHKbcq-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="BL7XOAKGHVEIXJEWBSFYG5EXXU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The healthiest protein bars&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZHM4J7TXB5BKVJ5GSGY2QPKXT4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://aloha.com/collections/" target="_blank"&gt;These bars&lt;/a&gt; are relatively low in sugar, high in fiber and have a good amount of protein. Most of the bars have 14 grams of protein and in some cases as much as 10 grams of fiber. That’s roughly a third of the recommended daily fiber intake for adults. The bars are made with mostly simple ingredients, such as almonds, rolled oats, brown rice protein, cashew butter and chocolate chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M2NIXL6YHNHM5FIR7SOHATCZPY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The ingredients are awesome, and the bars are plant-based,” Stephens said.

They’re relatively low in added sugars compared to other bars, and they’re not artificially sweetened. They contain a blend of plant proteins along with such things as almonds, organic coconut and unsweetened chocolate, and tapioca fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AEWHZQJNARCOHOKAXVIGPYNZKI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop.rxbar.com/shop/protein-bars.html" target="_blank"&gt;These protein bars&lt;/a&gt; are a favorite among dietitians because they’re made from just a handful of simple ingredients that you probably have in your kitchen,  such as dates, egg whites, nuts, coconut and other dried&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;fruit. They contain 12 grams of protein, four to six grams of fiber, and 14 to 17 grams of sugar. While these bars are generally on the sweeter side, their sugar content comes from the dates and other dried fruits — not from table sugar, corn syrup or other added sugars. “These bars can be great in the afternoon for a quick snack,” Stephens said. “I like them because they have a moderate amount of protein and ingredients that you can recognize.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PWKS55WZHFDKJMJV4CPMWDCKR4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Another good option are &lt;a href="https://shop.rxbar.com/shop/minis-variety-pack-1680840075.html" target="_blank"&gt;RXBAR Minis&lt;/a&gt;, which contain about half the calories and total sugar of the regular RXBARs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5VQKKC56PFGGVCL4FC554EPSWA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://allrealnutrition.com/products/ultimate-pack" target="_blank"&gt;Each bar&lt;/a&gt; contains 12 or fewer ingredients, including grass-fed milk protein. They also have more protein — 16 grams — than a lot of other bars we analyzed. They’re high in fiber and contain little or no added sugar, and they’re made from real-food ingredients  such as peanuts, dates, almonds, cocoa, chicory fiber and coconut. They’re available in nine&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;flavors, and they come in plastic-free packaging, including compostable wrappers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VY7DIK667RHULKMXTKV2XFSRMQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gomacro.com/shop/protein-bars/" target="_blank"&gt;These vegan protein bars&lt;/a&gt; contain a lot of nutritious whole-food ingredients, such as organic almond butter, organic rolled oats, organic sunflower seed butter, and a blend of organic plant proteins. They’re slightly sweeter than some other protein bars, with around 7 to 13 grams of added sugar per bar. But they also have a decent amount of protein (10 to 12 grams) and fiber (2 to 3 grams) per bar.

It has one of the best nutrition profiles of any GoMacro bar, with 12 grams of protein, 7 grams of added sugar and 2 grams of fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5DVYU7APTRDK5NBZFTHAXDJBXE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The main ingredient in &lt;a href="https://88acres.com/collections/protein-bars" target="_blank"&gt;these bars&lt;/a&gt; is pumpkin seeds. But they contain a lot of other wholesome ingredients, including sunflower seeds, cherries, bananas, dark chocolate and cinnamon. Each bar has 12 grams of protein, and they come in a variety of flavors,  such as banana bread, dark chocolate brownie and chocolate chip blondie. They’re also allergy-friendly: They’re vegan, nut-free, gluten-free, and made without wheat, soy, eggs and other top allergens, making them&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;a good choice for people with food allergies and sensitivities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YWVZKHNWNVFVFDH4OFAF7YYGPY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Most protein bars are sweet.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;But these Paleo-friendly &lt;a href="https://epicprovisions.com/collections/bars" target="_blank"&gt;Epic bars&lt;/a&gt; are a good choice for people who want a savory option that’s not plant-based. They’re made from a handful of whole-food ingredients such as bison, pork, grass-fed beef and venison, along with a variety of spices and seasonings. They’re slightly lower in protein than other bars — ranging from about 7 to 13 grams of protein per bar — but they’re also fairly low in fat, sugar and calories, Stephens said. One caveat is that some of the flavors are high in sodium. We recommend the &lt;a href="https://epicprovisions.com/collections/best-sellers/products/bisonbaconcranberrybar" target="_blank"&gt;Bison Bacon Cranberry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://epicprovisions.com/collections/best-sellers/products/beefaplebaconbar" target="_blank"&gt;Beef Uncured Bacon + Apple&lt;/a&gt; bars, which are among the flavors that are lowest in sodium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WJVUXMNH7ZADFOLXS3DVPGQJLY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some other good protein options from Epic are their “&lt;a href="https://epicprovisions.com/collections/bites/products/salmon-maple-coconut-oil-bites" target="_blank"&gt;salmon bites&lt;/a&gt;” made from wild Alaskan salmon, and their “&lt;a href="https://epicprovisions.com/collections/snack-strips" target="_blank"&gt;snack strips&lt;/a&gt;” made from &lt;a href="https://epicprovisions.com/collections/snack-strips/products/wagyu-beef-steak-strips" target="_blank"&gt;Wagyu beef&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://epicprovisions.com/collections/snack-strips/products/smoked-salmon-maple-fillet-strips" target="_blank"&gt;wild salmon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UFRMWE2CYBFWBJFDHA3F6XO5KA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Picky Bar company was founded by a group of professional endurance athletes. Their &lt;a href="https://pickybars.com/collections/nut-butter-bars" target="_blank"&gt;protein bars&lt;/a&gt; contain a mixture of plant proteins, healthy fats and complex carbs thanks to such ingredients  as nut butters, dried fruit, oats and seeds. Their protein bars have 10 grams of protein, 3 grams of fiber, and 2 to 6 grams of added sugar. They also fit a variety of dietary restrictions: They’re vegan and gluten, dairy and soy-free.

In a series of experiments, the team analyzed how many bacteria were transferred from a bitten cracker into a cup of sterile water compared with an unbitten cracker.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6ywiv000193b77nf1w9hfo@published"&gt;I’ve been friends with, “Sarah,” for over a decade, but over the last year, I no longer enjoy spending time with her. We were at our closest when I had a lot of mental health issues and needed constant validation and support. I think she enjoyed being needed. After some good therapy, I no longer need this type of validation and feel uncomfortable with how much detail she expects to know about my life.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="136" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb71nqy600583b77wqqsqkxr@published"&gt;Without the minutiae of my life to talk about, we don’t seem to have much in common. Our conversation usually veers into talking about our other mutual friends, which also makes me uncomfortable since I know she is doing the same about me with them. I can’t help but feel guilty about “abandoning her now that I don’t need her,” but I feel stressed every time we hang out. I have been trying to slowly phase out the friendship by seeing her less, but she keeps hitting me up, and I feel weird completely ignoring her. Am I wrong to throw away a long friendship? Do I leave her on read, or should I explicitly ask for space? Without making plans to see each other, we would not run into each other for a long while.&lt;/p&gt;

Ask her if she’s still playing pickleball and if she likes it. Ask her if that one co-worker she mentioned still makes weird faces during Zoom meetings. Ask her if she can recommend any good true crime documentaries, what she thinks Beyoncé’s next album will be like, and whether she wants to come with you to return something to Sephora and help you choose a new foundation. Take the reins of the conversation and talk about things that don’t involve the details of your life or criticizing your friends, and see if you enjoy her more. She might have interesting things to say! And if your relationship has been mostly defined by her probing into your deepest, darkest feelings, it’s no wonder you haven’t heard them.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6ywj3h001d3b77dyuwqisd@published"&gt;I’ve been in your shoes before, really dreading the conversations I had with a particular person. It was a revelation when it hit me that I didn’t just have to sit there and let them decide what we’d talk about. Instead, I could get ahead of their predictable and annoying content by shaping the exchange into something that I wanted to have. You might be pleased to realize, like I was, that your friend is not actually attached to the kinds of talks you normally have. Maybe she’s just operating out of habit, or doesn’t have any other ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="102" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6ywj5h001e3b7712z8fdyf@published"&gt;But, if you find that you still don’t really like her or don’t have much in common, the brave thing to do would be to tell her that you are less enthusiastic than you used to be about sharing the details of your life and gossiping about friends, and also feel you two may have grown apart. You can pair this with thanking her for all the ways in which she’s been there for you and shown interest in your life. Tell her that while you want to take some space, you will still show up for her if she needs you.&lt;/p&gt;

She really fought to beat it, but it was just too much for her in the end. Going through that opened my eyes to how easy it is for disordered eating to get passed off as being “health-conscious.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6ywy73001q3b7733mx3xyh@published"&gt;Now that I’m in my 30s, I’ve been seeing a lot of guys my age getting really obsessed with dieting and weight. Most of the time, I try to ignore it, but I’m getting worried about my friend “James.” A few years ago, he started this super strict diet, and it just seems to get more extreme over time. He talks about “toxins” a lot, and it feels like he’s always changing what he’s eating or doing, but never really explains why. I also see how he’s started working out differently. He’s way more focused on it than before—and not in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;

Everyone else just praises him for getting “cut” at 32, but I think it’s going too far. I don’t know if he sees it, and I just don’t want him to end up like my ex.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6ywy74001u3b77q913pf8p@published"&gt;I’m really sorry for your loss, and I can completely understand why you’d be vigilant about looking out for your friends, hoping to ensure that you never lose another person you love. It might ease your mind a bit to remind yourself that, unfortunately, a lot of people do experience disordered relationships with eating and exercise, and while it’s certainly very dangerous, it doesn’t always end in tragedy. But if your assessment of James’s escalating obsession with his diet and body is accurate, you’re still right to be concerned and to share that with him.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="114" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6ywy75001v3b77o64ce7qr@published"&gt;Does he know about your history? If so, I’m hopeful that he’d be understanding—even if he doesn’t change his behavior in response—about your concerns. The key here will be to be totally transparent, just like you were in your letter, explaining that you know it’s not your place to scrutinize his eating and exercise habits. Then explain that you have a heightened sensitivity to the way restrictive practices can spiral and have become worried about him. To avoid offending him or causing him to become defensive, you want to make sure to include the sentences, “I could be totally off base here,” “I hope this isn’t annoying,” and, “I just really care about you.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="154" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6ywy76001w3b77xl7krhd9@published"&gt;I have to warn you that he has this approach to diet and exercise for a reason, whether it’s a healthy one or an unhealthy one. Something about the restriction, the way his body looks, or the fantasy of the way his body will look if he tweaks just one more thing is likely making him feel the way he wants to feel right now, or helping him to avoid feelings he doesn’t want to experience. That’s a powerful force. Plus, diet culture is so widespread and normalized that even if he’s really overdoing it, he can easily tell himself he’s just taking care of his body. So your mini-intervention may not change his behavior. But one day in the future, it could be one of many things that inspires him to reevaluate what he’s doing. Plus, if this is bothering you, there’s something to be said for being honest and open with friends.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s valuable even if he doesn’t immediately take a rest day and eat a carb.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6yxbnj00283b77vcb6oepn@published"&gt;Six years ago, my sister unexpectedly died. She left a large part of her estate to my two nephews and “Maya,” the daughter of her best friend, “Josie.” I have control over the trust, and it states that the money should be used for educational purposes. It isn’t a problem since my nephews are both college age, but Maya is still in elementary school. Tragically, Josie died last year. I went to the funeral but only had sporadic contact with the family until recently. Josie’s widower has been increasingly calling me about Maya’s money.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6yxbnj002a3b77kc1nhzsw@published"&gt;It has gone from plausible (paying for dance lessons) to impossible (her day camp will only accept cash, and he will give it to them). The last conversation had him threatening me. It left me very shaken, and I am wondering about what to do next. I love and miss my sister, but I was never close to Josie or Maya. I really don’t want to deal with this for the next decade. Is it wrong to just dump Maya’s portion in a 529 plan and be done with it? The trust allows me to.&lt;/p&gt;

But check in with a lawyer/financial planner about the trust to hammer out the details. I do worry that the 529 plan won’t provide you the foolproof relief from never interfacing with this man again that you’re seeking. You’ll want to ask a professional about what your options are for dealing with this difficult widower and safeguarding Maya’s money, while simultaneously giving yourself the peace of mind you want and &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;need.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

My dad was devastated. About two years ago, Dad met a woman who’d also lost a partner and they started dating. They’ve made each other very happy, and my siblings and I have all been glad to see him doing well. We don’t know “Molly” very well, but she seems lovely. Dad sold the family home six months ago and moved in with her. He also revised his will. He’s 88, and Molly is 83. She has two kids, owns her home, and lives comfortably. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/_pages/cjm9soenr001k44kpzjusm1ac.html"&gt;Dad shared that he’s leaving one-third of his $200,000 estate to Molly, with the remaining two-thirds to be divided between us three children.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The patient: &lt;/strong&gt;A 64-year-old woman in Minneapolis, Minnesota&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;The patient visited a medical clinic to seek care for her &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2017/1015/p500.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2017/1015/p500.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chronic rhinosinusitis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — tissue inflammation in the sinuses and nasal passages — that was causing a viscous discharge containing mucus and pus to persistently drip down the back of her throat. She also reported headaches accompanying the postnasal drip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next:&lt;/strong&gt; The woman told physicians at the clinic that 23 years earlier she underwent &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/endoscopic-sinus-surgery" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/endoscopic-sinus-surgery" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;endoscopic surgery for chronic sinus infections&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which typically involves removing blockages from the sinuses with the help of a tube-shaped scope. But after the procedure, she continued to experience thick and discolored mucus, which was somewhat relieved by rinsing with antibiotics and saline. She continued this irrigation regimen for eight years, stopping two years before seeking help at the clinic. (&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/2833827" target="_blank" data-url="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/2833827" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;A report of the case&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; doesn't note why she stopped the rinses.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctors collected a mucus sample from one of the patient's sinus cavities for analysis. In addition, when they cleared out the accumulated mucus from her sinuses, they discovered something unexpected: bony lumps on the walls of the sinus cavities on either side of her nose. Their abundance in the woman's sinuses gave her sinus walls "a cobblestone appearance," the doctors wrote in their report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis:&lt;/strong&gt; A lab analysis of the mucus sample revealed that the woman had a bacterial infection caused by &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;, a bacterial species often found in healthcare settings that can be resistant to antibiotics. The cobblestone growths were "exostoses" — benign, bone tumors that often form as layers in ear canal tissue after repeated exposure to cold water. They are sometimes seen in a condition known as "surfer's ear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;The doctors treated the woman's bacterial infection using sinus rinses with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/gentamicin-injection-route/description/drg-20074471" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/gentamicin-injection-route/description/drg-20074471" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;gentamicin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful antibiotic, and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/budesonide-nasal-route/description/drg-20074729" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/budesonide-nasal-route/description/drg-20074729" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;budesonide&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a steroid that reduces inflammation. After the patient's symptoms subsided, she was switched to warm saline rinses and told to avoid cold water to prevent more bony lesions from developing. Her symptoms did not return, the report states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctors determined that the existing exostoses were not responsible for the woman's rhinosinusitis and were unlikely to cause future sinus problems. Therefore, the growths did not require surgical removal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-TpBGqjwqoEXxiSKSLLAvD6" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-TpBGqjwqoEXxiSKSLLAvD6 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;Since the 1930s, exostoses in the ear canal have been associated with surfing and other water activities that involve prolonged, repeated immersion in cold water. Researchers have hypothesized that these bony growths are a protective response of the ear canal's vascular tissue, which lacks a layer of insulating fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinus tissue also lacks a layer of fatty insulation, making it similarly vulnerable to the formation of bony growths. The patient's exostoses were likely caused by years of sinus irrigation with cold liquid, according to the report. While this development in the sinuses is rare compared to surfer's ear, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22753257/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22753257/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;several&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openneuroimagingjournal.com/VOLUME/6/PAGE/90/ABSTRACT/" target="_blank" data-url="https://openneuroimagingjournal.com/VOLUME/6/PAGE/90/ABSTRACT/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;other cases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; involving exostoses in the sinus cavities have been described in the medical literature — and they usually involved repeated cold-water nasal rinses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-TpBGqjwqoEXxiSKSLLAvD6-RatgQ4RVZ2v3nP7I2JMW6kdQZ0v4dqBG" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-TpBGqjwqoEXxiSKSLLAvD6-RatgQ4RVZ2v3nP7I2JMW6kdQZ0v4dqBG slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6p1v29000xs4m4ho7o7zau@published"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please bleed more&lt;/em&gt;, I thought, looking at my pricked finger. A drop of blood dangled at its tip, not quite big enough to fall. I needed enough blood to fill a small circle outlined on a piece of paper. Taking a little sample at home had sounded simple when I had ordered this test kit.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="58" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su53h00083b73eowgr9qp@published"&gt;“Everyone bleeds differently,” the man on my laptop screen said. I had booked a support call to make sure I did everything right. &lt;em&gt;Apparently I’m not good at bleeding&lt;/em&gt;, I thought. “You can use another finger,” the man added encouragingly. “That’s why there are four needles.” I clenched my teeth, aimed the flat triangular needle, and pricked again.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="31" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su56r00093b73chky4p7w@published"&gt;At last, after three pricked fingers, I managed to fill the paper outline with red. Staring down at the circle of hard-earned blood, I wondered: &lt;em&gt;How much plastic is in there?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="172" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su59n000a3b73d0dm31j5@published"&gt;All the effort was for a &lt;a href="https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/products/microplastics-test?variant=49128651161885"&gt;microplastics blood test&lt;/a&gt;, the first designed to be taken at home. Testing human blood for microplastics is a relatively new thing. Until this home test came out, the process could be done only at scientific research labs, which is not exactly an accessible option for most people. Microplastics are tiny pieces that routinely shed off plastic things we use, like water bottles and synthetic clothing. Over time, they break down, occasionally becoming small enough to &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.0c02317"&gt;test the limits&lt;/a&gt; of our measuring abilities. These microplastics are in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8520475/"&gt;air we breathe&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9920460/"&gt;food we eat&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169772224000640"&gt;water we drink&lt;/a&gt;. So they’re also &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81931-9"&gt;in our blood&lt;/a&gt; and can even travel to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03453-1"&gt;the brain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9953450/"&gt;the heart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11342020/"&gt;other organs&lt;/a&gt;. “Basically, anywhere you look in the human body, you find them,” said &lt;a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/morrissey/departments/biology/people/faculty-directory/Phil-Landrigan.html"&gt;Philip Landrigan&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician and public health physician who has researched plastics and health. Perhaps you’ve heard about the study that found that the brain can contain &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/03/health/plastics-inside-human-brain-wellness"&gt;as much plastic as there is in a disposable spoon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="128" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su5c7000b3b73xqefcabi@published"&gt;Perhaps you have also heard of &lt;a href="https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/pages/about"&gt;Bryan Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, the entrepreneur behind the test kit I was trying out, whose maxim is “&lt;a href="https://dontdie.bryanjohnson.com/"&gt;Don’t Die&lt;/a&gt;.” He’s famous for his attempts to reverse aging, including &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2023/05/23/bryan-johnson-tech-ceo-spends-2-million-year-young-swapping-blood-17-year-old-son-talmage-70-father/"&gt;injecting his son’s blood into his body&lt;/a&gt; and, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XypgGeD7gBk"&gt;more recently&lt;/a&gt;, removing all the plasma in his body to “replace it with very clean stuff.” The routine &lt;a href="https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/pages/blueprint-protocol"&gt;he shares online&lt;/a&gt; includes nearly 20 daily supplement pills. Through his company &lt;a href="https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/?srsltid=AfmBOorfW2a1NsGvpn7nBjlbZXz6-BoMgzC873ZtlrFkGnbfhxsPyrey"&gt;Blueprint&lt;/a&gt;, he sells products based on his regimen, like the $150 microplastics test kit, to people who share his hopes of longevity. “As part of my protocol, I began testing everything that was going into my body: food, water, air and everything else,” Johnson shared in an email. “I learned through testing that we are surrounded by toxins.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="101" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su5eq000c3b73ognyp6dk@published"&gt;Johnson routinely measures everything from his &lt;a href="https://mitohealth.com/blog/the-11-biomarkers-bryan-johnson-tracks-to-live-longer#:~:text=%F0%9F%93%89%20Ideal%3A%20%3C%205.2,cancer%2C%20and%20dementia"&gt;blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/blogs/news/i-have-the-world-s-slowest-speed-of-aging?"&gt;his DNA methylation&lt;/a&gt;: a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/dna-methylation"&gt;natural genetic change&lt;/a&gt; that can be used to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00462-6"&gt;estimate the pace of aging&lt;/a&gt;. He suggests that everyone else get tested too (though I doubt many will compete with his claim of being “&lt;a href="https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/pages/about#blueprint-bryan"&gt;the most biologically measured person in history&lt;/a&gt;”). But even as microplastics were becoming a familiar health concern, there was no test on the market for regular consumers. Johnson decided to change that. “A lot of people want to measure their levels of microplastics and it’s never been possible. Things that get measured, improve,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="164" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su5he000d3b73q9g1iyvf@published"&gt;Having microplastics in the human body does not sound good. To better understand &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; this isn’t good, I called up Heather Leslie. She’s a scientist &lt;a href="https://www.heather-leslie.com/"&gt;who does consulting&lt;/a&gt; on environmental and health issues, and she’s an expert on blood-borne plastic specifically. In 2022 she led the research team that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412022001258"&gt;found microplastics in human blood&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. Microplastics were first observed in humans &lt;a href="https://www.meduniwien.ac.at/web/en/about-us/news/detailsite/2018/news-october-2018/microplastics-detected-in-humans-for-the-first-time/"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, when researchers at the Medical University of Vienna detected them in the digestive system. After that study came out, Leslie felt it was important to check the bloodstream. Finding plastic circulating there proved that it was actually absorbed by our bodies, rather than something that simply passed through us. Since then, microplastics have shot into our collective health consciousness—and knowing that we can absorb them has motivated some, myself included, to cut down on plastic use. I’ve filled my kitchen with Pyrex instead of Tupperware. I quit reusing Ziploc bags. I check clothing labels, looking for natural fibers.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su5k2000e3b739hw74936@published"&gt;But when, a month after I’d mailed in the bloodstained paper, my microplastics test results arrived, those small efforts suddenly felt meaningless. I had to set up an account on Johnson’s Don’t Die app to view the results. Although the process was simple, it gave me time to become slightly apprehensive and to hope for a low microplastics count. Instead, my small circle of blood had 39—&lt;em&gt;39!&lt;/em&gt;—pieces of plastic in it. I had more microplastics than 77 percent of people who had taken the same test. I suspected there were even more pieces floating around in my sample, too small for this test to measure.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su5nj000f3b737dis41cq@published"&gt;Those little bits of plastic could’ve come from anywhere, really. I apply lipstick from plastic tubes. I buy plastic-wrapped fruit from the grocery store. Even my water filter, designed to remove harmful chemicals, is made of plastic. Although I know plastic is a problem, something still feels friendly about the bright-colored toothpaste tube, the crinkly bag of pasta. That’s the result of a life lived among successful ad campaigns, I guess. But putting a number to the microplastics in my blood had me starting to rethink. Suddenly, pollution felt personal. Was it time to stop buying plastic altogether?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="171" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su5qr000g3b73jhhgdunf@published"&gt;Just how microplastics affect us from the inside, and to what extent they do, is actually largely unknown. Leslie says plastic is “like spaghetti with a sauce.” The pieces of plastic are the spaghetti, and the chemicals attached to it are the sauce. Those chemical additives are what give plastic different properties, like color, stretchiness, and flame resistance. Sometimes, the chemical “sauce” leaches out of plastic, a process that, research has shown, &lt;a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/report/chemicals-plastics-technical-report"&gt;can be toxic&lt;/a&gt;. When it comes to the “spaghetti,” though, scientists don’t yet know how it affects our bodies. Microplastics could transport those harmful chemicals into humans. Then again, there are lots of ways for plastic chemicals to get inside us. (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479723021527#sec5"&gt;They’re common pollutants&lt;/a&gt; on their own.) It’s difficult to determine whether certain chemicals in our bodies come from microplastics or are features of our environment. And the effects of the microplastics themselves remain unclear. Although some researchers suspect they can cause damage by physically disrupting tissues and cells, it’ll take more investigating to definitively assess their health effects.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="205" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su5te000h3b73edyu0wzp@published"&gt;Even just getting an accurate measurement of microplastic pieces in the blood is difficult. “If you don’t use a really strong, robust, reliable, repeatable method—reproducible, all these things—then you are going to get a number out at the other end, but it might just be sort of a mythological number,” Leslie told me. Blueprint’s lab partner &lt;a href="https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/products/microplastics-test?variant=49128651161885#:~:text=Our%20lab%20partner%20developed%20a%20plastic%2Dfree%20Fluorescent%20Microscopy%20(FM)%20methodology%20using%20only%20glass%2C%20metal%2C%20or%20paper%20to%20avoid%20contamination."&gt;uses a plastic-free method&lt;/a&gt; to test the blood for plastic so that it’s not contaminated during testing. But there’s no way to know whether a sample got contaminated before arriving at the testing location. Leslie notes that scientists usually use a “field blank” for lab tests: an additional sample to show whether the sampling process caused contamination. The home test’s small, single sample doesn’t allow for this safeguard. And it’s all too easy to accidentally taint a drop of blood at home. Even the alcohol wipe I cleaned my finger with could be a source of plastic if the alcohol were ever stored in a plastic container. There’s also the chance I didn’t sanitize my hands correctly. So, for all my effort to get that drop of blood out of my finger, it might not have given me a truly accurate scientific read on how much plastic I contain.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="162" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su5w3000i3b73gru77ku4@published"&gt;Overall, Leslie believes I shouldn’t draw health-related conclusions from the test. “For an individual result, a one-off measurement like this, we can’t really say anything about how you should be feeling today or if this is going to lead to a chronic disease.” Also, there’s no proven way to get rid of the plastics inside us. (Some experimental methods, like the &lt;a href="https://x.com/bryan_johnson/status/1884313232946651413"&gt;plasma replacement&lt;/a&gt; Johnson has tried, were listed at the end of my test results—but their effectiveness remains uncertain.) “I don’t know of any way to get them out of the human body,” said Landrigan. “It’s nice that somebody’s got a test, but one of the things that we’ve all learned in medicine is you don’t test for stuff that you can’t fix.” Landrigan notes that it is wise to reduce plastic use, as much as you can. “But I can tell you that anyway,” he said. “I don’t need to find microplastic particles in your blood to offer you that advice.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su5yj000j3b73kv4965rc@published"&gt;Taking the test did motivate me to find more ways to minimize plastic in my life. (The results also came with tips for reducing exposure.) I found a cotton cover for my synthetic mattress. I’m on the lookout for natural fiber sponges. Yet … I’ve noticed that even these nonplastic products are often sold in plastic packaging. I’ve also realized that I’m not ready for the expense and effort of an extremely plastic-free lifestyle. While I aspire to buy only fresh, unbagged produce and to replace all my synthetic clothes, the fact is that those alternatives are pricey, and avoiding anything with plastic in it is simply out of my budget.&lt;/p&gt;

In a plastic-obsessed society, reducing exposure is only getting harder. In the past 15 years, the world has produced half of the plastic ever made, and production is still speeding up. A global plastics treaty &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/un-sets-date-extra-session-finalize-plastics-treaty-2025-03-03/"&gt;is being negotiated&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s not clear if it’ll lead to meaningful action to reduce the plastic in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe it’s the perfect anecdote to share the next time I’m at a party, holding a plastic &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;cup.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
