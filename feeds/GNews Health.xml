could be cut in half. And a small study co-authored by Sayour on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867424003982?via%3Dihub" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;glioblastoma&lt;/a&gt; showed the vaccines started affecting the tumors within 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Like any vaccine, mRNA cancer vaccines train the body to recognize and destroy harmful cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Unlike foreign pathogens, such as infectious diseases, cancer is caused by the growth of the patient’s own cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some cancer vaccines are highly personalized, using a patient’s own cancer cells to treat their tumors or train their immune system to kill off those dangerous cells if they recur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The ability to create specific vaccines for patients has tremendous, tremendous promise, but that was technology not possible five or 10 years ago,” said Sasson. “It really is a shift in the paradigm of how we treat cancers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Researchers are also investigating vaccines that would target cancer cells more broadly by identifying “fingerprints” of certain cancers, said Sayour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Additionally, the vaccines could be created for other conditions, such as type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It has potential to get rid of a lot of the chronic morbidity we see from disease, to cure diseases that are degenerative, to overcome cancer evolution and cure patients,” Sayour said. “mRNA could be the healthcare that the movable-type printing press was for human knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Yet federal and state decision-makers have targeted mRNA vaccines in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Vinay Prasad, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-shots-fda-trump-kennedy-fda-overruled-3ac51f93225aa5f20d5840468fff8b02" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/02/health/fda-covid-vaccines-prasad" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;overrode&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/02/health/fda-covid-vaccines.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Tk8.8Vg-.OB4eDrjDIBEu&amp;amp;smid=url-share" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;scientists&lt;/a&gt; at the agency to limit some Covid vaccines, including a new mRNA shot from Moderna, to children older than 12. Prasad also introduced similar limitations on the Covid shot from Novavax, which does not use mRNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;On Thursday, the FDA approved the original Covid mRNA vaccine from Moderna for children between the ages of six months and 11 years – but they narrowed its use to children with at least one underlying condition. (The vaccine for people older than 12 was approved in 2022.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prasad argued, in two memos recently released by the FDA, that the risks of Covid had dropped, while “known and unknown” side-effects could outweigh the benefits of getting vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Covid remains a leading cause of death in the US, with &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklydeaths_select_00" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;178 deaths&lt;/a&gt; in the week ending 7 June, the last week for which the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers complete data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;At the meeting of the CDC’s advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) in June, two of the new vaccine advisers – appointed by the health and human services (HHS) secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;, after he fired the previous 17 advisers – broached the safety of Covid mRNA vaccines, indicating future scrutiny of these shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Vicky Pebsworth, a registered nurse who has volunteered for years with the National Vaccine Information Center, said she was “very concerned” about side-effects from the Covid mRNA shots and asked for more data on safety, including “reproductive toxicity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Shortly before being appointed to the ACIP, Pebsworth and the founder of the National Vaccine Information Center &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/05/vicky-pebsworth-vaccine-experts-rfk-jr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that the FDA should not recommend mRNA Covid-19 shots for anyone “until adequate scientific evidence demonstrates safety and effectiveness for both the healthy and those who are elderly or chronically ill”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;At the June ACIP meeting, Retsef Levi, a professor of operations management at the MIT Sloan School of Management, said he believed mRNA side-effects were “being reported at rates that are far exceeding other vaccines even when you normalize to the number of doses, which does suggest something, I think”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-30" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-rsfwa"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;This Week in Trumpland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"the-stakes-us-election-edition","successDescription":"A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We have to stop giving them immediately!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Another new ACIP adviser, Robert Malone, has also &lt;a href="https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.9V36YN" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;repeatedly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2023/11/scicheck-posts-spread-false-claim-about-moderna-patent-application/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-824397015416" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;against&lt;/a&gt; mRNA vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In 2021, Kennedy, then chair of the anti-vaccine organization Children’s Health Defense, &lt;a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/FDA-2021-P-0460-30085" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;petitioned&lt;/a&gt; the FDA to revoke all approvals, and ban future approvals, of all Covid vaccines. He has &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/dec/10/robert-f-kennedy-jr/no-covid-19-vaccine-not-deadliest-vaccine-ever-mad/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; Covid shots the “deadliest vaccine ever made”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In May, Kennedy changed Covid vaccine recommendations from “should” to “may” for children, and eliminated the recommendation for pregnant women entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Also in May, the US canceled $766m in contracts for research on mRNA vaccines against H5N1 bird flu. Investment in the mRNA vaccine was not “scientifically or ethically justifiable”, Andrew Nixon, the HHS communications director, said in &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/06/hhs-misleads-on-mrna-vaccine-safety-after-pulling-moderna-funding/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;statements&lt;/a&gt; to the media, adding that the “mRNA technology remains under-tested”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Millions of mRNA vaccines have been given around the world, and the vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective in multiple studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Bans or limitations on mRNA vaccinations have been introduced in &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/mrna-vaccines-trump-boast-under-gop-attacks-legislation/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;seven states&lt;/a&gt;. One such bill in &lt;a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/billbookmark/?yr=2025&amp;amp;bn=S1036" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt; sought to pause “gene therapy immunizations” for 10 years – a category in which they incorrectly place Covid vaccines, and which could affect other therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Similarly, in Washington state, commissioners in Franklin county passed a &lt;a href="https://franklincowa.portal.civicclerk.com/event/350/files/attachment/2292" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;resolution&lt;/a&gt; urging the local health facility to stop providing and promoting gene-therapy vaccines; they also incorrectly included Covid mRNA shots in this category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There’s this scorched-earth mentality now, but I’m hopeful that once the dust settles, we’ll be able to reinstate or allow vaccine work for cancer purposes to proceed,” Sasson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cancer is the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;second leading&lt;/a&gt; cause of death in the US, and &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/all.html#:~:text=Approximately%2039.3%20percent" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;two in five people&lt;/a&gt; will be diagnosed with some form of cancer in their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There are currently only two FDA-approved vaccines that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9794995/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;prevent&lt;/a&gt; cancer – hepatitis B and human papillomavirus (HPV) – and both have been targeted by anti-vaccine activists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In January, Trump hosted the launch of Stargate AI at the White House. The project could eventually identify cancers and develop mRNA vaccines in days, Larry Ellison, the chair of the tech company Oracle who is involved with the project, said at the launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The project will be funded by private, not federal, dollars, but the work on cancer would draw upon research on cancer and mRNA, among other fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Yet the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt; has slashed other critical funding for cancer research, prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The administration canceled more than &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/26/cancer-research-trump-nci-cuts-plan" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$180m in grants&lt;/a&gt; through the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in the first three months of its term, and proposed cutting $2.7bn from the cancer center in the next NIH budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The administration has cut back funding for some family planning providers, which frequently offer screenings for HPV and other cancer markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Lawmakers have also made enormous cuts to Medicaid and insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which could mean uninsured and underinsured people wait longer for cancer treatment – or forgo it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There’s the potential for great harm, for massive public health issues to be set aside during this really broad approach of canceling research,” said Sasson. “There’s significant harm that’s going to happen by these sweeping changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For scientists who still have funding or those who are entering the field, “there’s tremendous uncertainty as to what the future will look like”, Sasson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But he is optimistic that mRNA vaccines for cancer and other illnesses will be able to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Scientists are often portrayed as “just trying to survive” funding cuts, but that’s not entirely accurate, said Sayour, before adding: “I don’t think many people in my field do this because they’re just trying to survive. I would want nothing more, honest to God, than to put myself out of business.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is the highest rate in the US, where the average is about one in 1,000 births. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to March of Dimes, clubfoot prevalence was highest among Alaskans of Asian and Pacific Islander descent, at an average of 4.6 incidences per 1,000 live births between 2014 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;American Indian and Alaskan Native rates were 3.6 per 1,000 births.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clubfoot, also called talipes equinovarus, occurs when a baby's foot turns inward so much that the bottom of the foot faces sideways or up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It happens because the tendons that connect the muscles to bones in the baby's leg and foot are shorter than they should be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About half of babies who have clubfoot have it in both feet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although clubfoot is not painful for an infant, treatment is necessary to allow for normal walking and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If left untreated, a baby will have trouble walking, be susceptible to infections on their feet, have thickened skin on the foot and develop arthritis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment includes physical therapy and in some cases surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But access to rehabilitation in remote communities like those in Alaska can be significantly limited. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rural Health Information Hub estimates one-third of the state's population - about 240,000 people - live in rural areas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the exact reasons for this increased prevalence of the particular condition are not fully understood, experts believe that there are several factors at play. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The prevalence of birth defects among native children is about 2.5 times higher&lt;span&gt; than among white children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Living near hazardous waste sites or having exposure to other environmental toxins can increase the risk of birth defects (remote Alaskan village of Utqiagvik pictured above)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A musculoskeletal defect that has emerged in Alaska is clubfoot &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other common birth defects in the state include heart defects, cleft lip and palate, and spina bifida. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some research suggests certain gene variations may be more common in Alaskan Native populations, potentially increasing the risk for specific birth defects. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;These variations don't guarantee the development of a condition, but they do increase susceptibility. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Previous studies have also shown maternal smoking can increase birth defect risks, and surveys have revealed a high percentage of women of child-bearing age smoke in Alaska.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Living near hazardous waste sites or having exposure to other environmental toxins can also increase risk levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Disposing of hazardous waste in rural areas is often difficult due to remoteness, harsh weather and inadequate infrastructure. As a result, it is sometimes disposed of in ways that allow dangerous chemicals to seep out and into surrounding soil, negatively impacting ecosystems and human health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, air pollution and contamination of ground water from manufacturing plants or local businesses can also expose pregnant residents to toxins.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to genetics and toxic waste, alcoholism can play a role the problem that has seemingly plagued these remote parts of the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The high number of alcohol-related birth defects in remote and rural Alaskan communities have led to the implementation of various measures, including alcohol bans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common alcohol-related birth defects involve the nervous system, heart and skeletal system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These can include conditions like microcephaly - a small head - heart defects and skeletal abnormalities such as radioulnar synostosis, the abnormal connection of the forearm bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Facial abnormalities like cleft lip and palate, and sensory issues such as vision and hearing problems are also frequently observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking might seem like a simple way to work out but it’s one of the best things you can do for your body. If you’re new to walking it’s worth being aware of the muscles it engages and how you can keep them strong, supple and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Walking is one of the most underrated forms of movement,” says Alo Moves' head trainer for Los Angeles, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1626907&amp;amp;xcust=fitandwell_gb_7594978304975648596&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alomoves.com%2Finstructors%2Flouis-chandler&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitandwell.com%2Fexercise%2Fwalking%2Fa-personal-trainer-says-these-are-the-three-exercises-you-should-be-doing-regularly-if-you-walk-a-lot" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.alomoves.com/instructors/louis-chandler" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1626907&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alomoves.com%2Finstructors%2Flouis-chandler&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fitandwell.com%2Fexercise%2Fwalking%2Fa-personal-trainer-says-these-are-the-three-exercises-you-should-be-doing-regularly-if-you-walk-a-lot" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="alomoves.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;Louis Chandler&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s low-impact, accessible and incredibly effective for maintaining overall mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also enhances body awareness by reinforcing good posture, stride mechanics and mindful movement, which are all essential for joint health and injury prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking can be surprisingly effective at helping you build strength, tone and endurance in your muscles, despite being low-impact. And because many people can sustain walking longer than running, it can also mean burning more calories over time, especially if you’re just starting with fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over time, walking builds endurance and resiliency that support healthy aging both inside and outside the gym,” says Chandler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a balance perspective, walking requires coordination and weight shifting from one side of the body to the other, which strengthens stabilizing muscles and helps prevent falls as we age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked Chandler what we should all be doing to support our walking muscles, and he gave me his top three exercises to stretch and strengthen the lower body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-pN6Lq5EMUY7gRFYJJKQTxQ" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-pN6Lq5EMUY7gRFYJJKQTxQ slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll need a pair of dumbbells or kettlebells, but you can also use filled water bottles or a backpack in a pinch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-calf-stretch"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Calf stretch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Alo Moves)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets: &lt;/strong&gt;2-3&lt;strong&gt; Duration: &lt;/strong&gt;20-30sec each side&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand facing a wall with your palms pressed into the wall at shoulder height.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place your toes on the wall, keeping your heel on the floor and leg straight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lean gently into the wall until you feel a stretch in the calf of your back leg.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it works: &lt;/strong&gt;“Tight calves can negatively affect your gait mechanics and may contribute to discomfort in the knees or lower back,” says Chandler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Keeping your calves flexible helps maintain a smooth, balanced stride, allowing you to walk longer distances comfortably and efficiently. Stretching the calves regularly also supports ankle mobility, which is key for stability during walking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-romanian-deadlift"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Romanian deadlift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Alo Moves)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets&lt;/strong&gt;: 2-3 &lt;strong&gt;Reps&lt;/strong&gt;: 8-10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand with your feet hip-width apart with a slight bend in your knees holding dumbbells, or a kettlebell or barbell in front of your thighs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your back flat and core engaged, hinge at the hips, pushing your hips back, to lower the weight, keeping it close to your legs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings, then push your hips forward to return to standing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep the movement slow and controlled throughout, and avoid rounding your back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it works: &lt;/strong&gt;“Romanian deadlifts [RDLs] are excellent for strengthening the hamstrings and glutes, which are the primary muscles that drive powerful, efficient steps,” says Chandler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Strengthening these muscles improves your walking speed and stamina, while helping to reduce fatigue during longer distances. Additionally, RDLs reinforce the hip hinge movement pattern, which is essential for protecting your lower back and promoting healthy posture as you move.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-weighted-march"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Weighted march&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Alo Moves)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets: &lt;/strong&gt;2-3 &lt;strong&gt;Reps: &lt;/strong&gt;10-12 each side&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand holding weights by your sides and engage your core.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lift one knee to hip height while keeping your spine upright and shoulders back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower your foot and repeat on the other side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Continue alternating legs, marching in place with control and balance, engaging your hips and core.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it works: &lt;/strong&gt;“Kettlebell marches are a dynamic exercise that improves core stability, balance and coordination,” says Chandler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All these elements are crucial for maintaining a strong, efficient walking gait. Because this movement mimics the natural gait cycle while adding resistance, you’re training your body to walk better under load. This helps build endurance and control, reducing fatigue and improving overall walking performance.”&lt;/p&gt;

Both areas tested positive for the West Nile virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, no county residents have reported being infected with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cache Mosquito Abatement District has been informed of the virus' presence in the county, and the district said it will continue its abatement efforts, especially in the evenings when the mosquitos known to carry the virus are the most present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The abatement district recommends Cache County residents do the following to limit the risk of acquiring West Nile virus: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use Environmental Protection Agency-registered insect repellent containing DEET, permethrin, picaridin, IR3535, or oil of lemon eucalyptus as directed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eliminate standing water around your home&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear long sleeves and pants between dusk and dawn, when mosquitoes are most active.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain roof gutters, keeping them clear of debris.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clean or drain swimming pools regularly. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure all window and door screens are intact and in good repair.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trim tall grass and weeds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus is the most common disease carried by mosquitoes in the United States and can affect humans along with birds and horses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Other animals can also be affected, they have reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is transferred from a mosquito through a bite to a receiver. Most people who get the virus have mild symptoms similar to those with the flu, the CDC reports. Health officials also report that many people also have no symptoms at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, one human case with the West Nile virus was found in Utah County, according to the county health department.

They suspect these improperly shaped proteins could &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14873675/creatine-Alzheimers-disease-improve-memory.html"&gt;interfere with how the brain works&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Amyloids are big and ugly and easy to spot under a microscope, so they've gotten most of the attention,' lead researcher Dr Stephen Fried said. 'But our research shows they're just the tip of the iceberg.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and primarily affects people over the age of 65. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Until now, researchers believed that clumps of amyloid and tau proteins were the main culprits behind the devastating cognitive decline seen in Alzheimer's patients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 7.2 million adults among that age bracket in the US are currently living with the condition, and over 100,000 die from it each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the study was conducted on rats, Dr Keith Vossel, a professor of Neurology at UCLA, says more research is needed to understand whether the same misfolded proteins can cause Alzheimer's disease in humans.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's an incremental advance, but it definitely builds on our knowledge base about this disease,' he told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Determining whether this change also happens in human brains, Dr Vossel said, 'would require autopsy based studies' or examining resected hippocampal tissue - 'that's really the only way to assess it directly.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At the moment it's a nice association,' he added, 'it just requires a lot more follow-up.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;On examination, they found that over 200 proteins were misfolded in the cognitively impaired rats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added that the findings could open the door to entirely new treatments and targets for Alzheimer's, which currently has no cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Alzheimer's Association warns that by 2050, nearly 13 million Americans may be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The disease is believed to be caused by the development of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain, which damage and kill cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The plaques and tangles form when amyloid proteins misfold and stick together, forming sticky clumps (plaques) and when tau proteins twist and get tied up (tangles). These toxic buildups block brain cells, or neurons, from sending signals properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to being in the wrong form, misfolded proteins are unable to carry out tasks necessary for a cell to function properly, which leads to damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A group of Johns Hopkins University researchers have found over 200 other misfolded proteins in rats that may also contribute to the cognitive decline caused by the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, this can impair brain functioning and lead to memory and muscle decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If it persists, this disruption can cause permanent damage in the brain that leads to Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As the disease progresses, patients may lose the ability to speak, care for themselves or even respond to the world around them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To better understand what drives this damage at the molecular level, Dr Stephen Fried and his team studied 17 rats, all 2 years old and raised in the same conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They put the animals through a series of memory and problem-solving tasks, and found that seven showed clear signs of cognitive impairment, despite growing up in the same environment as the other 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This allowed the researchers to focus on what might be happening inside their brains, and helped lead to the discovery of more than 200 potentially damaging proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The remaining 10 rats performed the same as 6-month-old rats did when they were given the same tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on their performance, the scientists then measured over 2,500 types of protein in all the rats' hippocampi - the part of the brain associated with spatial learning and memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that over 200 proteins were misfolded in the cognitively impaired rats. Though, it remains unclear which proteins, specifically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the same proteins maintained their shapes in the cognitively healthy rats who scored as well as their 6-month-old counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, the researchers concluded that more than 200 misfolded proteins are contributing to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We think there are a lot of proteins that can be misfolded, not form amyloids, and still be problematic,' Fried said of the results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, Fried and his team plan to study these phenomena under high-resolution microscopes to get a more detailed picture of their deformities at the molecular level. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A lot of us have experienced a loved one or a relative who has become less capable of doing those everyday tasks that require cognitive abilities,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Understanding what's physically going on in the brain could lead to better treatments and preventive measures.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was published on July 11 in the Science Advances journal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists may be one step closer to understanding why polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) tends to run in families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research, presented July 1 at the 41st Annual Meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Paris, suggests that "disruptions" in the way genes are turned on and off may increase the likelihood of developing PCOS. These "epigenetic" changes alter gene activity without changing DNA's underlying code, but they may also be passed down through families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theory, this research hints at a potential avenue for preventing PCOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a person was undergoing &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22457-ivf" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22457-ivf" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in vitro fertilization (IVF)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example, "these damaging [epigenetic] markers may be identified in embryos and changed before being implanted in a pregnant person, preventing PCOS from being passed onto future offspring," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sjpp.org/find-a-doctor/sheryl-ross-md/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sjpp.org/find-a-doctor/sheryl-ross-md/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Sherry Ross&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a board certified OB/GYN at Providence Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, "further research needs to be done in human embryos to understand if this is a safe and viable intervention," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="understanding-pcos-inheritance-3"&gt;Understanding PCOS inheritance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34805-pcos-symptoms-treatment-insulin-resistance.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34805-pcos-symptoms-treatment-insulin-resistance.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PCOS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a hormonal condition that affects 6% to 13% of reproductive-age women, according to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/polycystic-ovary-syndrome" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/polycystic-ovary-syndrome" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (WHO).

They found this concordance was twice as high among identical twins than fraternal twins, "suggesting that a large portion of the risk of developing PCOS is due to inherited genes," Chang told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's estimated &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/#inheritance" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/#inheritance" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;that 20% to 40% of people with PCOS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have a mother or sister with the condition. But the exact pattern of inheritance is unclear, Chang noted. On that front, the new research may shed some light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Qianshu-Zhu" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Qianshu-Zhu" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Qianshu Zhu&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of reproductive biology at the Institute of Reproductive Medicine at Chongqing Medical University in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/china" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/tag/china"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, included about 230 women undergoing IVF, 133 of whom had PCOS and 95 of whom didn't. The researchers looked at unfertilized egg cells and pre-implantation embryos from these participations, looking for chemical tags, known as epigenetic markers, on the cells' DNA. These markers affect the activity of the genes they're attached to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to the eggs and embryos of people without PCOS, those from participants with the condition showed "widespread disruptions" in many key genes, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1088643" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1088643" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;according to a statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Affected genes were involved in metabolic processes and activation of the early embryo's DNA. Sections of the genome called retrotransposons, which must be tightly regulated to keep DNA stable, were also affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also noted irregular patterns in well-known epigenetic markers that help control genes, including one called H3K27me3. In the statement, Zhu noted that "about half of the abnormal H3K27me3 signatures we saw in Day 3 embryos were already present in the oocyte [egg cells]. This tells us that an epigenetic signal is being passed from mother to embryo before implantation even begins."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding these mechanisms could enable new preventative interventions for PCOS. The authors suggested that embryos created through IVF could potentially be treated to tweak their epigenetics and thus lower the risk of PCOS being inherited. The findings could also be useful in aiding embryo selection processes in IVF, they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zhu emphasized, however, that the research is based on only lab-made embryos and cannot demonstrate how these epigenetic markers affect children. His team is now pursuing mouse studies to better understand the potential effects in offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What is exciting about this new research is it supports an actual genetic association between PCOS in families," Ross said, "and shines light for early diagnosis and interventions to prevent PCOS from being transmitted through families."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-sNa82pXzU48VEJHEt529dQ-TrEeATPmiE2DNAkDi8UOqOhimPo56Aap" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-sNa82pXzU48VEJHEt529dQ-TrEeATPmiE2DNAkDi8UOqOhimPo56Aap slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;A 51-year-old man showed up at a hospital in Germany looking as though he was wasting away, with swelling and tenderness in his ankles and knees. Then, his heart stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors were able to resuscitate him. Then, they got to work trying to figure out what was wrong. The man told them that for three months he had been suffering from diarrhea, weight loss, joint pain, and fever. His case was reported in this week's issue of &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm2413719?logout=true"&gt;the New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood tests didn't detect any infection, but imaging of his heart told a different story. Doctors saw "vegetation" on both his aortic valve and mitral valve. Vegetations are clumps or masses that often build up from an infection, generally containing a bundle of proteins, platelets, and infecting germs stuck together. While they cause damage where they are, if they fully dislodge, they threaten to move to other parts of the body, such as the brain or lungs, and cause dangerous blockages. In the man's case, the vegetation on his aortic valve appeared mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man was quickly sent to emergency surgery to replace his valves. Once removed, the diseased valves were sent for testing to see what was in those dangerous masses. The result likely came as a surprise to the doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man had in his heart &lt;em&gt;Tropheryma whipplei&lt;/em&gt;, a very common environmental bacterium that dwells in soil. Only in exceedingly rare cases does it cause an infection—but when it does it's a systemic, chronic, and sometimes life-threatening one called Whipple's disease. The condition affects about one to three people in a million, most often middle-aged Caucasian men, like the patient in this case. Overall, 85 percent of Whipple's disease cases are in men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Curious condition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how can such a common germ also cause such a rare infection? Researchers think it's due to genetic predisposition and a glitch in immune responses. Many people likely get infected with &lt;em&gt;T. whipplei&lt;/em&gt; as kids, and have either an asymptomatic or limited gastrointestinal infection. They then develop protective immune responses. But in the few people who develop Whipple's disease, this process seems to go awry. Researchers hypothesize that white blood cells called macrophages—which normally engulf and destroy invading pathogens—aren't able to finish the job. They engulf &lt;em&gt;T. whipplei&lt;/em&gt;, but don't neutralize the germ. When this happens, the immune system doesn't generate protective antibodies against the bacterium, and inflammation ratchets up. This, in turn, leads to the development of a systemic infection.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Last Tuesday, I watched my 84-year-old abuela teach my nephew how to play chess—every move calculated, every strategy passed down through generations of sharp minds. Her cognition was as precise as her opening gambit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;But just down the street, my neighbor struggles to remember his grandchildren's names at 78.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;The difference? The habits they've cultivated over a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;While genetics play a role in cognitive aging, our daily choices matter more than our DNA when it comes to staying mentally sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;The brain we have in our 80s is largely the product of the habits we practice today. Some patterns can fast-track cognitive decline, while others build resilience that lasts decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Here are seven habits that research shows can undermine your mental sharpness—and what to do instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"&gt;1. Living in social isolation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;"Loneliness kills. It's as powerful as smoking or alcoholism," says Robert Waldinger, director of the &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/#:~:text=Those%20who%20kept%20warm%20relationships,mental%20deterioration%20as%20they%20aged."&gt;Harvard Study of Adult Development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;The research is clear: people who maintained strong social connections throughout their lives showed significantly less cognitive decline as they aged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Think about it like this—your brain is like a muscle that needs regular workouts. Social interaction provides complex mental exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;When you're chatting with friends, your brain juggles multiple tasks: processing speech, reading facial expressions, remembering shared experiences, and formulating responses. It's like cognitive CrossFit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;The study showed that those who kept warm relationships got to live longer and happier, and the loners often died earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Even more striking: people's level of satisfaction with their relationships at age 50 was a better predictor of physical health than their cholesterol levels were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fix:&lt;/strong&gt; Schedule regular coffee dates, join clubs based on your interests, or volunteer for causes you care about. The key is consistent, meaningful interaction with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"&gt;2. Avoiding mental challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;When we shy away from mental effort—puzzles that stump us, books that stretch us, conversations that challenge our perspective—we deny the brain the workout it needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;As we age, this mental "coasting" can lead to earlier cognitive decline. But here's the exciting part: your brain is far more adaptable than we once believed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;"New brain cell growth can happen even late into adulthood," explains &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/learning-new-skill-can-slow-cognitive-aging-201604279502"&gt;Dr. Ipsit Vahia&lt;/a&gt; from Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. "The process of learning and acquiring new information and experiences, like through structured classes, can stimulate that process."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/were-only-human/aging-photographs-and-cognitive-quilts.html"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; even found that older adults who took up complex skills—like digital photography or quilting—saw improvements in memory compared to peers who only engaged in passive activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;It’s not just about staying busy; it’s about choosing challenges that stretch your capabilities and create new neural pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fix:&lt;/strong&gt; Take up a new hobby that challenges multiple cognitive systems. Learn a language, master a musical instrument, or enroll in classes that genuinely stretch your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"&gt;3. Chronic stress without management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Stress hormones like cortisol are like acid rain on your brain. Short bursts are natural and even beneficial, but &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-stress-can-shrink-your-brain"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; show that chronic stress literally shrinks brain tissue, particularly in areas responsible for memory and executive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;The Harvard study found that people who developed healthy coping mechanisms for life's ups and downs aged better cognitively. Those who learned to manage stress effectively maintained sharper minds well into their later years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fix:&lt;/strong&gt; Develop a stress management toolkit. This might include meditation, regular exercise, journaling, or talking with a therapist. The key is having multiple strategies you can deploy when life gets overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"&gt;4. Neglecting quality sleep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Sleep is when your brain takes out the trash—literally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;During deep sleep, your brain's glymphatic system washes away toxic proteins that can accumulate and contribute to cognitive decline. Skimp on sleep, and you're essentially letting garbage pile up in your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Poor sleep habits in midlife are strongly linked to cognitive problems decades later. It's like compound interest, but in reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fix:&lt;/strong&gt; Prioritize sleep hygiene. Create a consistent bedtime routine, keep your bedroom cool and dark, and avoid screens for at least an hour before bed. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"&gt;5. Skipping regular exercise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Here's what surprised me about exercise and the brain: it's not just about blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Regular physical activity literally creates new brain cells, particularly in the hippocampus, the brain's memory center. It's like installing extra RAM in your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Exercise also increases the production of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254621000971"&gt;brain-derived neurotrophic factor&lt;/a&gt; (BDNF), often called "Miracle-Gro for the brain." This protein helps existing neurons survive and encourages the growth of new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fix:&lt;/strong&gt; You don't need to run marathons. Walking briskly for 30 minutes most days of the week can significantly boost cognitive function. Dancing, swimming, or even gardening counts. The key is consistency, not intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"&gt;6. Smoking and excessive alcohol consumption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;The Harvard research was unambiguous: those who lived longer and enjoyed sound health avoided smoking and alcohol in excess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Both habits accelerate brain aging by increasing inflammation and reducing blood flow to brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Smoking damages blood vessels throughout your body, including those in your brain. Even moderate drinking can shrink brain tissue over time, particularly in areas responsible for decision-making and impulse control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fix:&lt;/strong&gt; If you smoke, quit. If you drink, do so in moderation—no more than one drink per day for women, two for men. Seek support if you need it; quitting these habits is easier with community backing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"&gt;7. Mental passivity and routine rigidity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Your brain thrives on novelty and challenge. When you stick to the same routines day after day, year after year, you're essentially putting your mind on autopilot. This mental passivity can accelerate cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;The study also debunked the idea that people's personalities "set like plaster" by age 30 and cannot be changed. Your &lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-brain-plasticity-2794886"&gt;brain remains plastic&lt;/a&gt; throughout your life, but only if you give it reasons to adapt and grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fix:&lt;/strong&gt; Shake up your routines regularly. Take a different route to work, try a new restaurant, read books outside your usual genre, or engage in activities that require you to think in new ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"&gt;The compound effect of healthy habits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;What makes the Harvard study so remarkable is its revelation that "the role of genetics and long-lived ancestors proved less important to longevity than the level of satisfaction with relationships in midlife." Our choices compound over decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Think of brain health like tending a garden. You can't plant seeds today and expect flowers tomorrow. But tend to your mental soil consistently—feed it with challenges, water it with social connection, give it the sunlight of new experiences—and you'll harvest cognitive vitality for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;The beauty of neuroplasticity is that your brain remains changeable throughout your life. It's never too late to start building better habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5"&gt;Your brain's future starts today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;As I write this, I'm reminded of my abuela's hands, still steady as she moves her chess pieces, her mind still sharp as she navigates complex strategies with the wisdom of eight decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Her secret wasn't just good genes—it was a lifetime of nourishing her brain with challenging activities, strong relationships, and the daily practice of staying curious about the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="whitespace-normal break-words"&gt;Your 80-year-old self is watching. What habits will you choose to cultivate today?&lt;/p&gt;

In an ongoing clinical trial, the company tested the treatment in 14 people with FH and/or premature CAD, and found that a single dose of the therapy led to a 53% reduction in LDL, on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These early data are drawn from three groups of people who received different doses of the treatment. The four participants given the highest dose saw the largest benefit: a 69% reduction in LDL, at maximum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the groups, "VERVE-102 was well-tolerated, with no treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) and no clinically significant laboratory abnormalities observed," Verve's statement noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VERVE-102 uses a modified version of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/58790-crispr-explained.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/58790-crispr-explained.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CRISPR&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the famous gene-editing system. The CRISPR systems developed originally introduce a "break" in both strands of a DNA molecule, and then, the cell's built-in repair system swoops in to repair the break. However, this comes with the risk of adding unwanted mutations to the DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/new-crispr-alternative-can-install-whole-genes-paving-the-way-to-treatment-for-many-genetic-disorders" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/new-crispr-alternative-can-install-whole-genes-paving-the-way-to-treatment-for-many-genetic-disorders"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New CRISPR alternative can 'install' whole genes, paving the way to treatment for many genetic disorders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-KFLePRxjU7wn7pD9ew9xcd" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-KFLePRxjU7wn7pD9ew9xcd slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/crispr-therapy-for-high-cholesterol-shows-promise-in-early-trial" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/crispr-therapy-for-high-cholesterol-shows-promise-in-early-trial"&gt;&lt;u&gt;new cholesterol-lowering therapy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; instead uses "base editing," which swaps out just one letter in DNA's code, thus sidestepping the danger of a double-stranded break. Like classic CRISPR, the base editor still includes a "guide" molecule to fix its aim at the correct gene, and from there, an enzyme tweaks just one letter in DNA's code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VERVE-102 targets a gene called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/pcsk9/#conditions" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/pcsk9/#conditions" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PCSK9&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which controls the number of LDL receptors on the surfaces of cells. The quantity of these receptors dictates how quickly LDL gets cleared from the blood. When PCSK9 is too active — as it is in the genetic disease FH — it breaks down LDL receptors before they can make it to the cell surface, thus causing LDL to accumulate in the bloodstream instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new therapy, given in a single intravenous infusion over two to four hours, is designed to turn off PCSK9, especially in the liver, where LDL receptors are abundant. Across the three dosing groups, there was a decrease in both PCSK9 activity and LDL levels in the 28 days following the treatment, with higher doses tied to greater reductions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the company is enrolling a fourth group of patients who will receive an even higher dose, and who are being recruited in the United Kingdom, Canada, Israel, Australia and New Zealand. As of April, two people in the group had been treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verve expects to release data from this portion of the trial later this year, as well as start its next clinical trial, which will include more participants. The next trial will likely enroll U.S. participants, as the Food and Drug Administration granted the therapy &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ir.vervetx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/verve-therapeutics-receives-us-fda-fast-track-designation-verve" target="_blank" data-url="https://ir.vervetx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/verve-therapeutics-receives-us-fda-fast-track-designation-verve" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;"Fast Track Designation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;" to help expedite its development and approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, in June, Verve was acquired by the drug company Lilly, which aims to continue the development of the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"VERVE-102 has the potential to be the first&lt;em&gt; in vivo&lt;/em&gt; [in the body] gene editing therapy for broad patient populations and could shift the treatment paradigm for cardiovascular disease from chronic care to one-and-done treatment," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gatewaylabs.lilly.com/meet-our-team/ruth-gimeno" target="_blank" data-url="https://gatewaylabs.lilly.com/meet-our-team/ruth-gimeno" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ruth Gimeno&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Lilly group vice president of diabetes and metabolic research and development, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ir.vervetx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-acquire-verve-therapeutics-advance-one-time-treatments" target="_blank" data-url="https://ir.vervetx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-acquire-verve-therapeutics-advance-one-time-treatments" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;said in a statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larger and longer clinical trials will be needed before VERVE-102 can earn approval and reach more patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-KFLePRxjU7wn7pD9ew9xcd-jD1sOLhTv9GVezPn6AqbeITxlF5ktzx4" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-KFLePRxjU7wn7pD9ew9xcd-jD1sOLhTv9GVezPn6AqbeITxlF5ktzx4 slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

While taking daily doses of turmeric supplements, he was hospitalized due to liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A light bulb went off in my head,' she told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/liver-damage-turmeric-supplement-woman-hospitalized-rcna217578"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;, who first revealed her story, 'and I said, 'Oh, my gosh! I wonder if this is what's wrong with me?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She went to the ER, where a blood test quickly revealed that her liver enzyme levels were 60 times higher than normal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors said she was &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14854459/Doctor-warns-five-common-supplements-cause-deadly-heart-attacks-liver-failure.html"&gt;just 'one step' from liver failure&lt;/a&gt;, which would have led to needing an organ transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Katie Mohan, 57, from New Jersey, said she nearly lost her liver after taking turmeric supplements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The turmeric supplements she took were pills that contained about 2,250 milligrams (mg) of curcumin, which gives turmeric its color, per pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is about 11 times the daily dose recommended by the World Health Organization for an average woman weighing about 150lbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Turmeric, a golden-colored staple in curries, is generally safe to consume, particularly in foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has exploded in popularity in recent years particularly among arthritis patients, amid claims the supplement can help reduce inflammation and soothe joints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But doctors warn that it is possible for the supplement to cause liver damage, which may be because it can trigger an immune reaction in the organ.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Mohan's case, she was hospitalized for six days and received an IV drip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But her doctors said she was fortunate that the injuries were not much worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nikolaos Pyrsopoulos and a hepatologist at NYU who treated her, said: 'It was very serious.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Making exercise a regular habit can be difficult for many people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests that tailoring it to your personality might help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You’re more likely to make exercise a habit if you enjoy doing it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Establishing new habits is hard (to say the least). It takes mindset work and consistent practice to make any new habit stick. But there are a few tricks that can be employed to help make the process easier—like working out according to your personality type. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers from the United Kingdom sought to determine whether certain personality types were more drawn to or enjoyed specific intensities of exercise. They published their findings in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Let’s break down what they found. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers initially recruited 132 participants from the general public for this study; 86 of the 132 completed the entire protocol. Participants first completed an online questionnaire that included demographic information, the Perceived Stress Scale 10 items (PSS-10), and a modified version of the Big Five Inventory 10 items (BFI-10). The PSS-10 is designed to assess people’s perceived stress levels, and the BFI-10 is a shortened version of a longer assessment for determining personality traits. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The big five personality traits assessed with the BFI-10 include extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability and openness&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Emotional stability relates to neuroticism. For example, people who score high in emotional stability are considered low in neuroticism. They tend to be calm and resilient with more positive attitudes and moods. People who score low in emotional stability tend to have more neurotic traits, including anxiety, irritability and moodiness, and tend to have stronger reactions to stress.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Following the online assessments, participants were brought into an exercise lab for baseline fitness testing. This included body composition, which is a measured ratio of lean tissue to fat tissue, and strength tests that included push-ups, planks and jumping in place with hands on hips. Participants’ aerobic capacities were also tested on a stationary bike, first with a “lab low-intensity” ride, and then, after a 30-minute rest, a high-intensity ride on the same bike was used to measure VO2peak. VO2peak is the highest oxygen consumption measured during an exercise test. It basically measures how efficiently your body is at using oxygen during intense exercise. After each exercise session, participants were asked to rate their level of enjoyment from 1 to 7, 1 being not enjoyable and 7 being extremely enjoyable. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Following the baseline tests, participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. The control group was instructed to maintain their normal lifestyle and was given a plan of weekly 10-minute stretching exercises. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The intervention group was provided with a heart rate monitor and a home-based 8-week cycling and strength training program that included “rides” of three varying intensities—low, threshold and high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Each ride would be completed once per week for a total of three rides per week. The overall intensities gradually increased over the 8-week intervention. They were also instructed to do one &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7949443/best-strength-training-exercises/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;strength training workout&lt;/a&gt; a week, which included 3 sets of 8 repetitions of squats, lunges, push-ups, sit-ups, calf raises and glute bridges. Participants were asked to rate their level of perceived enjoyment of each exercise session over the entire intervention period. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Based on the pre-intervention testing: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Extraversion was predictive of having higher VO2peak, anaerobic threshold and peak power output. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conscientiousness predicted completing push-ups, longer plank times, more weekly hours of physical activity and lower body fat percentage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neuroticism predicted poorer heart rate recovery times (how quickly your heart rate comes back down to pre-exercise levels), regardless of fitness level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those who were part of an endurance club (like a running club) were more extraverted and conscientious. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regarding &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026823/what-is-joyful-movement/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;exercise enjoyment&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Those who scored higher in neuroticism reported less enjoyment of the low-intensity lab session and threshold ride.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extraversion predicted enjoyment of the VO2peak test and the HIIT sessions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both openness and agreeableness predicted more enjoyment for the long, easy ride.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regarding program adherence and participation:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Intervention group participants who scored higher in neuroticism were less likely to record their heart rate data during the 8-week intervention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extraverted participants were less likely to attend post-intervention testing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those scoring high in openness were more likely to attend post-intervention testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The 8-week intervention revealed that:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Those who scored high in neuroticism were the only ones who noted a decrease in stress from the intervention. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All participants in the intervention group, regardless of personality traits, exhibited a significant increase in weekly hours of exercise, VO2peak, peak power output, number of push-ups and duration of planks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conscientious participants showed smaller improvements in peak power output. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those with extraversion traits had a greater increase in RERpeak (respiratory exchange ratio, a measure of intensity and effort during an exercise test).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There were a few limitations to this study. First, 70% of the participants were found to be open-minded, conscientious and emotionally stable, presenting some bias in the sample of participants. While this study included the Big Five personality traits, it did not consider subtraits or other personality factors, like grit or anxiety. Lastly, this study only included cycling and body weight exercises. This limits participants’ responses to just those exercises. So if you already know you hate cycling, chances are you’re not going to enjoy any of the variations in intensity either. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that certain personalities may enjoy certain intensities of exercise more than others. "We found some clear links between personality traits and the type of exercise the participants enjoyed most,” says &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/67380-flaminia-ronca" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Flaminia Ronca, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, one of the study authors in a press release, “which I think is important because we could potentially use this knowledge to tailor physical activity recommendations to the individual—and hopefully help them to become and remain more active."&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People who scored high in either neuroticism or extraversion:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Enjoyed the higher-intensity workouts more than the lower-intensity ones. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers note that those with neurotic tendencies may tolerate a HIIT workout better than a long, vigorous workout because the latter may allow for more anxiety, worry and negative self-talk to creep in and affect performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People who scored high in conscientiousness:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Engage in physical activity for the health benefits. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They’re also goal-oriented. So if they’ve set a goal to complete 6 months of training for a marathon, they’re likely to achieve it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While research offers a glimpse into the what and why of topics, you probably don’t need a personality test and a study to tell you what types of physical activity you find enjoyable. But these results do provide you with possible reasons why you might not enjoy certain types of physical activity. And you can now use your personality as the scapegoat if someone tries pushing you to do an activity you don’t like. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are a few other things to consider when finding activities that you’ll enjoy. For example, do you like doing things as a team or group, or are you more of an individual player? If you like doing things as a team, consider group fitness classes. Choose the type and intensity based on your personality and fitness level. Group personal training is another option. Or you can join a community sports team or running or cycling club.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re more independent and aren’t into the group thing, consider activities you can do on your own or with a friend. You may also enjoy one-on-one personal training. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that personality traits may determine which types of physical activities will be most enjoyable. Ultimately, the best types of physical activity for you are ones you’ll enjoy and stick with. And while guidelines are important—like getting a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week—any amount of physical activity is better than none, and it all counts.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Start where you’re at and what you’re comfortable with, and make intentional decisions to move more throughout the day, even if it’s in small spurts. Over time, as your body gets used to moving more, you may naturally increase the amount. And before you know it, you’ll be crushing those guidelines (in a good way).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EatingWell</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 20:07:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxORGw5UlRjckNqY1oyQTlIYWlqbDlkWTIzS29JQk5RVDBUbE10NzRnckJIc3ctem1Ud3pDVTMycE5MOGJsa0hIWjI5VzZ3RUc1R1ZkU2F5X2MyY3BUcjEzY3lnT2pZQjZLY0ZHOTBuWkhCcjhKTjhHT3RnMHFzck1EV2Z2amNlaDJobDZQYVVn</guid></item><item><title>女性对这项椅子瑜伽计划赞不绝口，现在每天只需0.56美元-它有助于在短短28天内缓解疼痛和疲劳： “这改变了我的生活！ '-每日邮报 | Women are raving about this chair yoga program that's now just $0.56 a day - it helps relieve pain and fatigue in just 28 DAYS: 'This changed my life!' - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxQM1lRRndiS1N2OXhVcXlPa1pweGpJNUpEQVRoLUNwcHp1bEI3RUllcm9VMFVnV21WTHNZRkVBSmZjMWUtcm03Slcwc0NydnJJYUV5eTVjRm90OFBFbEpwOVdiUWZvYUhhclJHZFFvUW43TWN4UUZSQzl5SERIQTBfcHQ0cF9FSkRUTmtsVFFaWEhIYks3UlRB0gGcAUFVX3lxTE1uNFp0dDZNMHc1Q1ltSGZPTTR2WDdsMUU5QURfa2pwSTR1cWh4RUtRSXhwekplU3oydlg4UElTUU9VQzk0dVVtWGJNUnNxRUkzU1hvaWRCYnY0SnNzZTM0YVd1eFdaWFZOTGtZc0JVZ1pNd3FKSTBnR2RVajcwcFlaXzYxVGlGdkxkelAtUnM1Z2lxNGNDSE90LTRtRg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-small"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Daily Mail journalists select and curate the products that feature on our site.

No two women are alike in their experiences, but many share the same set of complaints about middle-age health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Things like poor sleep, heightened stress, joint aches, muscle stiffness, and sheer exhaustion can make getting through the day feel impossible.

&lt;p&gt;A man in New South Wales (NSW) caught the state's first known case of Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV), a rabies-like infection that can't be treated once symptoms appear. It was the fourth human case of the infection ever documented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man, who was in his 50s and from northern NSW, was in critical condition and being treated at a hospital on July 2, when NSW Health issued a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/news/Pages/20250702_01.aspx" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/news/Pages/20250702_01.aspx" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about his case. The next day, the health department announced that the man had died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We express our sincere condolences to the man's family and friends for their tragic loss," an NSW Health spokesperson said July 3, according to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/breaking-news/nsw-man-dies-after-contracting-australian-bat-lyssavirus/news-story/78bd376d2da8aac790162c77581b906b" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/breaking-news/nsw-man-dies-after-contracting-australian-bat-lyssavirus/news-story/78bd376d2da8aac790162c77581b906b" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Australian&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the rabies virus, ABLV belongs to a genus of viruses called &lt;em&gt;Lyssavirus&lt;/em&gt;. "All&lt;em&gt; Lyssavirus&lt;/em&gt; species have the potential to cause rabies disease in people, but rabies virus is by far the most common cause," the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/country-risk/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/country-risk/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notes. After exposure but prior to symptoms setting in, ABLV can be treated in the same way as rabies — namely, with rapid wound care and the administration of antibodies and vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with rabies, ABLV infections are considered very rare. Since the virus was &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/Rabies-Australian-Bat-Lyssavirus-Infection.aspx" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/Rabies-Australian-Bat-Lyssavirus-Infection.aspx" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;first identified in 1996&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, only four cases of human infection — including the recent one in NSW — have been documented in Australia, and none have occurred elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABLV is transmitted from living bats to humans, typically through bites or scratches from the animal. In the man's case, he had "been bitten by a bat several months ago and received treatment following the injury," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Keira-Glasgow-2162878531" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Keira-Glasgow-2162878531" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Keira Glasgow&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a director in health protection at NSW Health, said in the statement. The statement did not specify the exact nature of the treatments provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/surgery/in-extremely-rare-case-michigan-resident-dies-from-rabies-after-receiving-transplanted-kidney-carrying-the-virus" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/surgery/in-extremely-rare-case-michigan-resident-dies-from-rabies-after-receiving-transplanted-kidney-carrying-the-virus"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In 'extremely rare' case, Michigan resident dies from rabies after receiving transplanted kidney carrying the virus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-eVT6sTC2FyYw4CfnP9tDK6" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-eVT6sTC2FyYw4CfnP9tDK6 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Further investigation is underway to understand whether other exposures or factors played a role in his illness," Glasgow added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Australia, direct evidence of ABLV has been found in flying foxes and insect-eating microbats. But NSW Health warned that any bat could potentially carry the germ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public is advised to avoid touching or handling bats at all. "Only people who have been vaccinated against rabies and who are trained in handling bats should ever handle bats or flying foxes," the department cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, if a bat bites or scratches a person, they should take these steps: Wash the wound with soap within 15 minutes, apply an antiseptic that kills viruses, and seek immediate medical attention, the department advises. Antibodies against rabies and a rabies vaccine would then be given, which can prevent rabies and other &lt;em&gt;Lyssavirus&lt;/em&gt;-related illnesses if symptoms have not yet emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once symptoms of ABLV set in, though, "sadly there is no effective treatment," Glasgow said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early symptoms of ABLV infection resemble those of rabies and include flu-like symptoms of headache, fever and fatigue. The infection then rapidly progresses to affect the central nervous system, triggering paralysis, delirium, convulsions and death, typically within a few weeks of symptom onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies and ABLV infections have "shown a wide variability in the time it takes for symptoms to appear following exposure to an infected animal (from several days to several years)," NSW Health noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-eVT6sTC2FyYw4CfnP9tDK6-8TRCCBKXJrM8dsFTa7urzoOqDwcSPP4q" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-eVT6sTC2FyYw4CfnP9tDK6-8TRCCBKXJrM8dsFTa7urzoOqDwcSPP4q slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Want to remember things better as you get older? The secret might be surprisingly simple: focus on feeling good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13607863.2025.2468408#d1e802"&gt;Recent research&lt;/a&gt; involving over 10,000 people aged 50 and above has found that people with higher wellbeing perform better on memory tests as they age. The study, which followed participants for 16 years, checked their wellbeing and memory every two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers expected that good memory might improve wellbeing, but found no evidence for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, it was wellbeing that predicted better memory performance over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprise-discovery-about-sugar-in-the-brain-could-help-fight-alzheimers?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Surprise Discovery About Sugar in The Brain Could Help Fight Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that the link between wellbeing and memory stayed strong even after taking things like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="167292" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; into account. This means wellbeing may affect memory on its own, not just through effects on mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167294" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167294" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/WomenInSwimsuitsWithAttitude.png" alt="Older women in swimsuits" class="size-full wp-image-167294" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/WomenInSwimsuitsWithAttitude.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/WomenInSwimsuitsWithAttitude-600x374.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167294" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;You can increase your wellbeing by being present. (diversifylens/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the study's authors acknowledge some limitations that should be taken into account when considering the real-life application of their findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study relied on people reporting their own wellbeing, which can be biased – some people might overestimate how good they feel. The research also can't prove that wellbeing directly causes better memory – other factors like income or life experiences might play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the memory tests used were relatively simple and might not capture the full complexities of how memory works in real life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the study offers a compelling reason to invest in your wellbeing now. Here are five evidence-based strategies to increase the positive emotions in your day-to-day experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Five strategies to boost your wellbeing now&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Be grateful&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people feel better when they keep a &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/gratitude-comes-with-benefits-a-social-psychologist-explains-how-to-practice-it-when-times-are-stressful-250882"&gt;gratitude journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Engage in acts of kindness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being kind can &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379927236_Acts_of_Kindness_How_Helping_Others_Can_Boost_Our_Well-being"&gt;boost&lt;/a&gt; the wellbeing of both initiators and receivers of kindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Nurture your most important relationships&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positive relationships are important for our wellbeing. These should be &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/emotional-fitness/201205/10-ways-to-nurture-your-relationship"&gt;nurtured and maintained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Be more present.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a distracted world, being present in the moment can be difficult. Being present is the opposite of multitasking. This takes intentional practice and you can develop it through meditation or &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/councils/theyec/2019/11/25/how-being-present-can-be-the-most-effective-thing-you-do-today/"&gt;mindfulness practices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Do things that lead to a "flow" state.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being in a flow state means that we are fully engaged in an activity. It is a mental state where a person feels fully involved and enjoys a process or activity that provides just the right balance of challenge and reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often talk about this as "being in the zone". Finding an &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224927532_Flow_The_Psychology_of_Optimal_Experience"&gt;engaging hobby or sport&lt;/a&gt; is a good way of increasing flow moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensuring that you and the people around you experience positive emotions regularly is not just about feeling good in the moment. It is also an important investment for the future, ensuring better mental health and wellbeing for yourself and others.

&lt;p&gt;A radar station on Hainan Island in China has recently made an extraordinary discovery—plasma bubbles in Earth’s ionosphere, located over the Pyramids of Giza, Egypt. This remarkable event marks a breakthrough in global space weather monitoring and reveals the increasing potential for long-range ionospheric tracking. In an age where satellite communications and navigation systems are vital to everyday life, such findings provide insight into how scientists can better protect these systems from disruptions caused by space weather phenomena. This development, documented in a recent study &lt;a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GL109579" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Geophysical Research Letters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has far-reaching implications for the future of both civilian and military space operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;While scientists have been tracking ionospheric disturbances for some time, the ability to detect them from nearly 5,000 miles away marks a significant leap in technology. The radar, developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, successfully detected these plasma bubbles during a geomagnetic storm in November 2024. This not only demonstrates the radar’s impressive detection range but also showcases the radar’s evolving capability to monitor space weather in real time. This breakthrough was made possible by improvements in the radar’s software and ionospheric modeling, which have extended its detection range more than three times since the radar’s initial test operations earlier in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What Are Plasma Bubbles and Why Do They Matter?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Plasma bubbles are vast, electron-depleted cavities that form in the ionosphere after sunset. These bubbles follow&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/animals-humans-earths-magnetic-field/" data-type="post" data-id="72528"&gt; Earth’s magnetic field &lt;/a&gt;lines and can stretch hundreds of miles across. Though invisible to the naked eye, these bubbles cause significant disruptions in the Earth’s communication and navigation systems. As they expand, their irregular walls scatter radio signals, leading to phenomena like GPS interference, disruptions to satellite television broadcasts, and even errors in stock-market time stamps. “The walls of these equatorial plasma bubbles are where the communication and navigation signals are corrupted,” noted a NASA factsheet for the CINDI satellite mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;These plasma bubbles are not only disruptive but also unpredictable, posing a unique challenge for forecasting space weather. Their sudden appearance and expansion can affect regions where ground-based sensors are scarce, especially over vast tropical oceans. It is in these areas that the new radar system, designed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, becomes invaluable. By offering real-time monitoring of the ionosphere from vast distances, it allows scientists to track these bubbles as they form and spread, significantly improving our ability to predict and mitigate their effects on communication systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Role of LARID Radar in Detecting Plasma Bubbles&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The radar system, known as the Low Latitude Long Range Ionospheric Radar (LARID), was designed to track and map ionospheric disturbances like plasma bubbles. Unlike traditional radar systems, which only monitor local areas, LARID uses phased-array technology to transmit high-frequency pulses that bounce off the ionosphere. These signals travel far beyond the radar’s immediate vicinity, allowing for the detection of disturbances nearly 6,000 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the case of the bubble observed over Egypt, the radar system’s ability to detect such a disturbance was the result of improvements made to its software and ionospheric modeling. The radar team was able to capture echoes from the bubble after the geomagnetic storm caused by the interplanetary magnetic field’s flip southward. This event, which occurred in the late afternoon, caused a significant disturbance in the ionosphere, leading to the formation of plasma bubbles. The radar system, designed with 40 antennas that can rapidly change direction, tracked the bubble as it formed and expanded. By doing so, it confirmed that the disturbance was real, corroborated by GPS receivers in Africa that registered changes in the total electron content rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How Space Weather Affects Our World&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The detection of plasma bubbles has important implications not just for scientists but also for industries that rely on satellite-based technologies. GPS systems, used by everything from airlines to financial institutions, can be rendered unreliable when these bubbles form. Since these plasma bubbles are often unpredictable, having an early warning system becomes critical to maintaining the functionality of global communication networks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The effects of plasma bubbles extend beyond just communications. Stock-market time-stamping systems, for example, are highly sensitive to GPS signals. Any disruption to these signals could potentially lead to financial discrepancies, while airline navigation systems could face serious disruptions, endangering the safety of air travel. Understanding and tracking these disturbances is thus vital for protecting the modern systems we rely on daily.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Step Toward Global Space Weather Monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This groundbreaking discovery provides a glimpse into the future of global space weather monitoring. The ability to detect and track plasma bubbles from such vast distances opens up new possibilities for monitoring the ionosphere in real time. Researchers have argued that placing several radar stations strategically across the globe could create a low-latitude network capable of covering the entire equatorial belt, allowing scientists to track space weather disturbances as they occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“The results provide meaningful insight for building a low latitude over‑the‑horizon radar network in future,” Hu and colleagues wrote, arguing that three or four such stations could survey the whole equatorial belt in real time. By positioning radar stations in key locations such as Brazil, Indonesia, and West Africa, scientists could fill in the gaps where ground-based sensors are not available, allowing for comprehensive space weather monitoring across vast oceans. These radar stations could not only predict plasma bubble activity but also provide early warnings of disruptions to global communication and navigation systems.&lt;/p&gt;

A quick &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/google/index.html" id="mol-3ac80990-5db4-11f0-8b31-8fface898847"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; search confirmed that anxiety among new mothers is common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, the label didn’t feel right. But she let it go for a couple of days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, the heaviness in her chest transformed into a severe cough that staff in her doctor's office chalked up to Covid. But her symptoms only worsened, until one night, while feeding her baby, she began coughing up phlegm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only, a trip to the bathroom later confirmed that she was coughing up blood, the result of a leaky mitral valve in her heart that she did not know about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She rushed to urgent care, where she learned &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-14617637/I-suffered-postpartum-preeclampsia-like-Meghan-Markle-scariest-time-life-thought-going-die.html"&gt;her blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; was ‘200 over something’. A normal, healthy blood pressure is less than 120/80 millimeters of mercury (mmHg).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Declining to take an expensive ambulance, she drove herself to the hospital where she was &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14375301/common-pregnancy-symptom-early-birth-headache-warning-sign.html"&gt;diagnosed with preeclampsia&lt;/a&gt; - sustained high blood pressure either during pregnancy or postpartum, often including high levels of protein in urine that indicates damage to the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lindsay Herriott, 40, developed severe postpartum symptoms after delivering her baby in 2022. Doctors dismissing it as anxiety, until she later coughed up blood and was hospitalized with preeclampsia. The condition stemmed from an undiagnosed leaky heart valve (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her high blood pressure, coupled with increased fluid volume, worsened her leaky mitral valve, forcing fluid back into her lungs, causing dangerous symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Priya Freaney, director of the Northwestern Postpartum Hypertension Program within the Women's Heart Care Program, told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.today.com/health/womens-health/new-mom-postpartum-preeclampsia-rcna217199"&gt;Today&lt;/a&gt;: '[A leaky mitral valve is] often asymptomatic for many years or decades for people and only comes to light when the system is provoked in a way.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Herriott, of Chicago, recovered from her bout of high blood pressure with medications specifically designed for the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treating preeclampsia also requires continuous blood pressure monitoring, and doctors are still keeping an eye on her mitral valve, which may require surgery to repair in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she got pregnant a second time in 2024, she was constantly on the lookout for symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They appeared one night in October that year, soon after her son Oakley's birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her heart began to race as if in a panic when she went to lie down. She believed it to be a sign of PTSD, but she and her husband went to the hospital to be safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors at the hospital informed her that she developed a pulmonary embolism – a blood clot that had traveled to her lung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Swedish study of 2M pregnancies found preterm births increase hypertension risk, especially with extreme prematurity (22-27 weeks). Risk peaks within 10 years but persists for decades, elevating long-term heart disease danger &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I immediately started crying because that's what you see in movies where people just drop dead,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The clot can be deadly, killing around 10 to 30 percent of patients within a month. If caught early, though, the death rate drops to about eight percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following prompt hospital treatment, Herriott's recovery required her to self-inject blood-thinning medication for the duration of her breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Preeclampsia is more common among women who are past 20 weeks of pregnancy. Postpartum preeclampsia occurs in fewer than one percent of all pregnancies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘A lot of people believe that preeclampsia is a pregnancy problem, and when the pregnancy is over, the preeclampsia is over,’ said Dr Freaney. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are still working out the exact cause, which means so far, there are no targeted treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, they are following several leads, including chemicals that affect blood vessel health, harmful antibodies that squeeze blood vessels, stress on blood vessel walls, weak mitochondria, chronic high blood pressure, and genes that react to low oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Preeclampsia can have a lifelong impact. Research shows that it raises a woman's future risk of cardiovascular problems like heart attacks and strokes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Warning signs of pre-eclampsia include high blood pressure, protein in urine, severe headaches, vision problems, pain below the ribs and vomiting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; In addition to higher heart attack and stroke risks, around two out of three women with preeclampsia will die of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2019 &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6019643/"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;in Utah looked at how pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders affected women’s long-term health. They analyzed birth and death records from 1939 to 2012, categorizing mothers by the number of pregnancies they had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women who had two or more pregnancies during which they had preeclampsia were twice as likely to die early from any cause, four times more likely to die due to complications of diabetes, three times as likely to die of heart disease, and five times as likely to die of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And women with two or more affected pregnancies lived about seven years fewer on average than those with no complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each year, it causes over 70,000 deaths worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Herriott will work with a cardiologist for the rest of her life to monitor her mitral valve and preeclampsia symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Looking back, she said, she’s glad she didn’t immediately accept her obstetrician’s nonchalance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘I was proud of myself for trusting my own gut and (recognizing) that, even in the throes of all the hormones, you do know your body.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 18:13:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>深蹲与步行：降低血糖的最终赢家- Earth.com | Squats vs walking: The definitive winner for reducing blood sugar - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxOWkhsdUhIMjR4NEt0MVJhZVcwdGVnWTJ5b3FFVGpFZDhxOGhmakJKdE9fQlYzNloyX2RvTFJxRTdMLWhpSm0wNVFJMTIySHotbExpRGhUbmhvdGpPV0RYMVNmNXZkVU00WExhMkNqSDI0SF9YbzJQSC1GTEhZeDBsMUNaaFhqa2trV0FkZVpuWjlHdjBBcmZZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our desks keep us glued to chairs for hours, yet our bodies keep score. After meals, our blood sugar spikes, particularly if we remain sedentary. Two fresh studies have now analyzed the respective benefits of walking and doing squats, in terms of their ability to lower those &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/diabetes-patients-overtreated/"&gt;glucose&lt;/a&gt; surges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One test pitted simple body‑weight squats against walking sessions of different lengths, to see which shrinks after‑meal sugar spikes. The contest delivered a surprise winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-squats-and-mini-walks-win-the-day"&gt;Squats and mini-walks win the day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ying-Gao-55" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ying Gao&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Zhejiang University&lt;/a&gt; guided 18 young men through four, single‑day &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ying-Gao-55" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt; that included long sitting, a half‑hour stroll, three‑minute mini‑walks every forty‑five minutes, or ten fast squats on the same clock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The squat and frequent mini-walk conditions slashed postprandial sugar spikes by 21 percent, when compared with nonstop &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sitting-for-hours-daily-shrinks-your-brain-even-if-you-exercise/"&gt;sitting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same sugar‑flattening effect almost doubled the benefit of the lone, 30‑minute walk. This indicates that muscles care more about timing than about total steps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, energy burned was matched across conditions, so extra calorie loss was not the hero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deskbound adults spend more than 9 hours per day seated, on average, a pattern that is linked to higher diabetes &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sedentary-behavior-sitting-for-hours-health-risk-early-death/"&gt;risk&lt;/a&gt;, even in habitual exercisers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shifting some of that time toward burst‑style movement gives muscles periodic wake‑up calls without asking for gym clothes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-advantage-of-squats"&gt;The advantage of squats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squatting lights up the quads and glutes far more than an easy stroll. The trial found that higher averaged &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/4825-emg-electromyography" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;electromyogram&lt;/a&gt; amplitude in those big muscles tracked directly with lower blood sugar swings, while hamstring effort mattered less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Only increased aEMG in quadriceps and gluteal muscles was associated with a reduction in postprandial glycemic response,” the authors noted. More muscle fibers squeezing at once appear to pull extra sugar out of circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those same fibers are among the largest glycogen reservoirs in the body. Emptying them repeatedly during the workday sets the stage for later insulin‑assisted refilling, a cycle that may dampen glucose peaks in subsequent meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-walking-paradox"&gt;The walking paradox&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three‑minute strolls every 45 minutes came close to the squat effect, even though each break felt relaxed. Small bursts appear to wake up leg muscles repeatedly, keeping sugar disposal lines open throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the single, longer walk under‑performed. The data suggest that the body values frequent nudges over one heroic push, which echoes office studies where hourly movement trims cholesterol and insulin peaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/to-get-fit-and-stay-healthy-walk-this-exact-distance-every-day/"&gt;Walking&lt;/a&gt; breaks also counteract stiffness, boost mood, and require no floor space. That makes them a friendly backup plan on days when squats are impractical (such as in narrow airplane aisles or crowded buses).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lactate-and-glut4-link"&gt;Lactate and GLUT4 link&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squats briefly cut off oxygen to working muscle, boosting lactate production. Laboratory work in human myotubes shows that “lactic acid has an important role in energy metabolism of human myotubes” and even raises glucose uptake three‑fold when it replaces sugar in the growth medium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher lactate feeds a cellular message that orders more &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/10/2432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;GLUT4 transporters&lt;/a&gt; to the muscle surface, the very gates that shuttle glucose inward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists agree that, in response to stimulation by insulin or exercise/muscle contraction, GLUT4 “translocates from intracellular storage vesicles to the muscle cell surface” where it plays an essential role in glucose transport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lactate shuttle also lets active muscles share this metabolite with the liver for fresh glucose production – forming a push‑and‑pull cycle that stabilizes blood sugar without sharp highs or lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lasting-ripple-effects"&gt;Lasting ripple effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Enhanced skeletal muscle and whole body insulin sensitivity can persist for between 24 and 48 hours after one exercise session,” noted physiologist &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4816200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gregory Cartee&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single bout of exercise can thus keep muscles extra sensitive to insulin for up to two days, meaning that each squat break may buy prolonged metabolic calm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because squats recruit more fibers per second than walking, they may stretch that window even further, though larger trials will be needed to test this idea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if the extra edge is small, the compounding effect over hundreds of workdays could be substantial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employers who are worried about productivity may find that adding a beep on the office clock every 45 minutes is cheaper than funding a corporate gym and easier than policing step counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-leveraging-squats-in-daily-life"&gt;Leveraging squats in daily life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten deep squats take roughly 20 seconds and require zero equipment. Set a 45‑minute timer, stand up, drop and rise ten times, then sit back down, and you will have matched the glucose benefit seen in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If knee pain rules out squats, a three‑minute hallway march delivers nearly the same payoff. What counts is breaking sitting time often and pushing large muscles hard enough to feel them work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pairing these movement snacks with balanced meals can amplify their punch, especially for people watching carbohydrate intake. Consistency beats intensity, so keep the breaks small, frequent, and sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-caveats-and-future-research"&gt;Caveats and future research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The volunteers in Gao’s study were healthy young men, leaving questions about how older adults, women, or people with diabetes will respond. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormonal differences and joint limitations could modify the squat &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/studies-learn-the-exact-amount-of-time-you-should-spend-training-to-build-muscle/"&gt;advantage&lt;/a&gt;, and researchers are already planning follow‑ups that include broader demographic groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratory meals were standardized, yet real‑world diets vary wildly in sugar content. Future work will need to track continuous glucose monitors over weeks to see whether movement snacks tame everyday spikes triggered by pizza lunches and birthday cake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, scientists still debate the precise chain of molecular events between lactate, GLUT4, and long‑term insulin signaling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decoding that pathway could unlock new drug targets that mimic the down‑to‑earth prescription of standing up and moving every 45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38629807/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp;amp; Science in Sports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 18:01:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxOWkhsdUhIMjR4NEt0MVJhZVcwdGVnWTJ5b3FFVGpFZDhxOGhmakJKdE9fQlYzNloyX2RvTFJxRTdMLWhpSm0wNVFJMTIySHotbExpRGhUbmhvdGpPV0RYMVNmNXZkVU00WExhMkNqSDI0SF9YbzJQSC1GTEhZeDBsMUNaaFhqa2trV0FkZVpuWjlHdjBBcmZZ</guid></item><item><title>比以前已知更多的错误折叠蛋白质可能导致阿尔茨海默氏症和痴呆症- Medical Xpress | More misfolded proteins than previously known may contribute to Alzheimer's and dementia - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxORVFXZGFSNVU5NHQ4aV9aSGFzRFg4bElHT0t2SndfaVFPcWNrVUUtQ1RCM2tjV3Z1Z1RTZ2lVUnhjVFUtMm9LZkJFdTRLaTZCMXBlRVBZVmJ0VS1sM3JacHpBbGZFQU9RZjlld3hwaUdSems1S3ZsY2szRkJYUnptdGFwdUcyY1N1eVlvNGpOZ1VOcXpHT3BsX0pn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, the story of Alzheimer's research has been dominated by a battle between A-beta and tau amyloids, both of which can kill neurons and impact the brain's ability to function. A new study suggests, however, that these sticky brain plaques may not be operating alone.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;
     
     
     &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7587637799"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
     
&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Johns Hopkins University researchers have identified more than 200 types of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/misfolded+proteins/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;misfolded proteins&lt;/a&gt; in rats that could be associated with age-related cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings could lead the way to finding new therapeutic targets and treatments in humans that could provide relief for the millions of people over 65 who suffer from Alzheimer's, dementia, or other diseases that rob them of their memories and independence as they age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Amyloids are the buildup of misshapen proteins. They're big and ugly and easy to see under the microscope, so it makes sense that they catch our attention. But we're seeing hundreds of proteins misfolding in ways that don't clump together in an &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/amyloid/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;amyloid&lt;/a&gt; and yet still seem to impact how the brain functions," said Stephen Fried, an assistant professor of chemistry and protein scientist who studies how molecules in the brain change during aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our research is showing that amyloids are just the tip of the iceberg."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt3778" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the molecular differences between older brains that are mentally sharp and those that are experiencing decline, Fried and his team studied 17 two-year-old rats that grew up in the same colony. Seven rats performed poorly on memory and problem-solving tests and were considered cognitively impaired, while 10 performed as well as six-month-old rats.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The researchers then measured more than 2,500 types of protein in the hippocampus, the part of the brain associated with spatial learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time, scientists were able to determine for a large number of proteins whether individual proteins were misshapen or folded incorrectly, allowing the researchers to work out which proteins misfold for all the rats and are associated with aging in general versus which proteins specifically misfold in cognitively impaired rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 200 proteins were misfolded in the cognitively impaired rats yet maintained their shapes in the cognitively healthy rats. The findings suggest that some of those proteins are contributing to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+decline/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misfolded proteins are unable to carry out tasks necessary for a cell to function properly, so cells have a natural surveillance system that identifies and destroys these misbehaving proteins. Previously, researchers thought misfolded proteins—specifically A-beta and tau proteins—were only disruptive when they clumped into amyloids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We think there are a lot of proteins that can be misfolded, not form amyloids, and still be problematic," Fried said. "And that suggests these misfolded proteins have ways of escaping this surveillance system in the cell."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But exactly how those misfolded proteins slip past a cell's security system remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the team plans to look at misfolded proteins under high-resolution microscopes to get a more detailed picture of what their deformities look like at the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/molecular+level/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;molecular level&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A lot of us have experienced a loved one or a relative who has become less capable of doing those everyday tasks that require cognitive abilities," Fried said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Understanding what's physically going on in the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; could lead to better treatments and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/preventive+measures/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;preventive measures&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;

It is unclear when the death occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dff957" class="body-graf"&gt;The hospital noted that "appropriate initial management" and "attempts to provide life-saving resuscitation" was performed, but "the patient did not recover."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b8dd42" class="body-graf"&gt;Rapid diagnostic testing led to a presumptive diagnosis of Yersinia pestis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-da4585" class="body-graf"&gt;Coconino County Health and Human Services said testing results confirmed Friday that the patient died from pneumonic plague, described as “a severe lung infection caused by the Yersinia pestis bacterium.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e19ce8" class="body-graf"&gt;This marked the first recorded death from pneumonic plague in the county since 2007, when an individual had an interaction with a dead animal infected with the disease, according to county officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9341da" class="body-graf"&gt;The most common forms of plague are bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic. Pneumonic plague "develops when bacteria spread to the lungs of a patient with untreated bubonic or septicemic plague, or when a person inhales infectious droplets coughed out by another person or animal with pneumonic plague," according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d99a0e" class="body-graf"&gt;Bubonic plague — known for killing millions in Europe in the Middle Ages — is now rare but some cases are reported in the rural western U.S. every year, as well as in certain regions of Africa and Asia, according to the CDC. The disease is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis and affects people and other mammals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-19f6ed" class="body-graf"&gt;Symptoms usually appear within two to six days of infection and include fever and swollen painful lymph nodes, most commonly found in the armpit, groin and neck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-17bf57" class="body-graf"&gt;An average of seven human plague cases are reported each year in the U.S., but those cases aren’t always fatal, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps-statistics/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;data from the CDC from 2000 to 2023.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6db66c" class="body-graf"&gt;Humans are usually infected through a bite of an infected rodent flea or by handling an animal carrying the disease, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. It can be easily cured if given antibiotics early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-864201" class="body-graf"&gt;The hospital is working with the Coconino County Health and Human Services Department and the Arizona Department of Health Services to investigate the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aefaaa" class="body-graf"&gt;"NAH would like to remind anyone who suspects they are ill with a contagious disease to contact their health care provider. If their illness is severe, they should go to the Emergency Department and immediately ask for a mask to help prevent the spread of disease while they access timely and important care," the hospital said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aac4fb" class="body-graf"&gt;Earlier in the week, the &lt;a href="https://www.coconino.az.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=3239" target="_blank"&gt;Coconino County Health and Human Services (CCHHS)&lt;/a&gt; reported a prairie dog die-off in the Townsend Winona area, northeast of Flagstaff — which officials said “can be an indicator of plague.” The department noted the recent death is not related to the prairie dog die-off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ea4e4c" class="body-graf"&gt;The impacted area was on private land and the CCHHS was working with the property owner to collect fleas for testing. Burrows will also be treated to reduce flea activity and the area will be monitored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-490d60" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Our hearts go out to the family and friends of the deceased,” said Coconino County Board of Supervisors Chair Patrice Horstman. “We are keeping them in our thoughts during this difficult time. Out of respect for the family, no additional information about the death will be released.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 17:59:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQSGZscVE1X1VfMTBqQU5tVi1RS183R1VRcHgzbnZ2QlFnZklMcXhUR3k5S3B5Y093d21xdlZ4dFd0MU1GaWxzUkN4WWJOem1oQjhRZ0NuV1dzWlV5bTJJMG1Ua3ZxVWtucFYzVlFJSVRTUHVYWUMwZFlzMVZOcVJ4UElDWlhVYTZH</guid></item><item><title>那些在60多岁时看起来仍然年轻的人经常发誓这12个小习惯- YourTango | People Who Still Seem Young In Their 60s And Beyond Often Swear By These 12 Little Habits - YourTango</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxNdWZ0WUJ0elZiMlIyUTVnZUljb3V3cXlVNWpWRGUwVGl2UEx6QVhTMDkzNmVfNGh1UXpwMFpLMk5VUURicUZZNWtDdU8zTnhnYUNfTUl6a3BUU21GblBvTUZ6YXhxaEk2QW1aNVZwNFRSY2ZIUVZSWTB3UVAxSHNad2M0blBhcXpfMkdRdExMZFpaMGE5QkZlc2gwYw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has long been believed that life expectancy is largely, if not solely, determined by your genetics. It turns out that environmental factors, like your lifestyle and daily habits, play a greater role in how long we will live and how well we will age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I was diagnosed with depression in 2007, I have developed better coping skills as I age by finding truly tiny things to make a big difference in managing my feelings. In the meantime, or in addition to the work you do with a qualified professional, these small habits may help you feel better, or at least help you reclaim your best self and stay young well into your 60s and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;People who still seem young in their 60s and beyond often live by these little habits:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Keep up by tuning into podcasts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-07/people-who-become-super-agers-live-by-this-rule-listen-podcasts.png" alt="woman who will become a super ager listening to podcasts" title="people who become super agers live by these rules like listen to podcasts" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; ViDI Studio / Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most important elements of staying young is managing my thoughts and keeping up. Recently, I have started to listen to podcasts. Not only do they silence any negative thoughts about aging, but they also educate me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t listen to podcasts about how to improve my life because I feel like they focus me on my mood instead of distracting me from it. Instead, I listen to podcasts about movies, "&lt;a href="https://podcastreview.org/review/you-are-good/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;You Are Good&lt;/a&gt;” and women, “&lt;a href="https://thehistorychicks.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;History Chicks&lt;/a&gt;” and a great one called “&lt;a href="https://yourewrongabout.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;You’re Wrong About&lt;/a&gt;” which reexamines historical events and analyzes the truth behind the stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/master-skills-live-longer-average-american"&gt;Psychology Says If You Can Master These 4 Skills, You'll Live Longer Than The Average American&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2.

If I can, I take my book outside and read it in the park or on my hammock. By getting outside, I &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/benefits-of-daily-sun-exposure-vitamin-d"&gt;add the benefit of sunshine&lt;/a&gt;, something proven to improve moods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I can’t get outside, I read under my full-spectrum light, a very effective sun substitute that gives the same effects. So, take some time and get outside with your book. You will be glad you did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/harvard-study-finds-thing-people-live-longer-better-lives"&gt;85-Year Harvard Study Finds That 1 Simple Thing Makes People Live Longer, Better Lives — And No, It's Not Diet Or Exercise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3.

Epsom salts can also increase the magnesium levels in the body, the reduction of which can be reduced by stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is something I do as much as I possibly can. I add lavender or eucalyptus Epsom salts, and I soak. I bring my book along and have &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/best-powerful-inspirational-books-every-woman-should-read"&gt;the added benefit of reading &lt;/a&gt;and shutting down my brain by doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warm baths are regarded for their ability to promote relaxation and reduce stress, potentially affecting longevity by addressing the negative health consequences of chronic stress. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079218301552" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Studies suggest&lt;/a&gt; that bathing can lower levels of stress hormones and promote the release of endorphins, which positively impact mood and feelings of well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/being-happy-skill-life-lessons-training-manual"&gt;Being Happy Is a Skill — And Psychology Says These 30 Life Lessons Are The Training Manual&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4.

For years I have worked in a soup kitchen on Thursdays and for the past decade I have volunteered with the National Alliance on Mental Illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/2019328226/how-volunteer-work-can-make-impact-your-friendships-mental-health-and-self-worth"&gt;Volunteering helps with two things. &lt;/a&gt;The first is that giving back to other people &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/weirdly-effective-ways-fool-brain-into-being-happy"&gt;naturally increases dopamine&lt;/a&gt;, that feel-good chemical that courses through our body when we do something good. That feel-good chemical is an excellent way to lift our mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second reason volunteering helps is that it gets me out of the house. I do tend to isolate when I am depressed, and taking a shower, getting out of the house, and interacting with people is an excellent antidepressant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find someplace you can volunteer, somewhere you have a genuine interest. Many of my clients find working at an animal shelter, interacting with dogs and cats, can help them in a big way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/ways-be-better-human-every-day"&gt;10 Tiny Ways To Be A Better Human — Today, Tomorrow And Always&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5.

I have decided to pursue a master’s degree in history. And it has been one of the best decisions of my life. Why? Because by doing so, I am using a different part of my brain, a part of my brain that hasn’t worked for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/fun-easy-hobbies-pick-up-need-life-change"&gt;Doing something new&lt;/a&gt; is a key way to stay youthful. Not only using a different part of your brain but experiencing things that you have never experienced before can cause dopamine to flood your body and make you feel good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/quiet-signs-someone-grew-up-feeling-emotionally-neglected"&gt;5 Quiet Signs Someone Grew Up Feeling Emotionally Neglected (Even If They Hide It Well)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6.

A friend. Someone who makes you laugh and feel seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spending time with people who love you and support you and who let you know they will always be there for you is one of the most potent anti-agers.

The second is that they help improve breathing. When done consciously, breathing can be very helpful with mental health management. Thirdly, yoga and meditation can make your body strong, and strength can make you feel really good about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meditation and yoga may also help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, with links to improvements in cardiovascular health. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0531556524001967" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Research has found&lt;/a&gt; that these practices can enhance mood and well-being, and might improve cognitive function, potentially reducing the risk of age-related cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/habits-make-sixties-seventies-best-years-of-your-life"&gt;If You Want To Make Your 60s And 70s Some Of The Best Years Of Your Life, Say Hello To These 13 Habits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9.

As we get older, &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/experts/susan-derry/why-play-is-important-for-adults"&gt;fun is something that can be elusive.&lt;/a&gt; The idea of getting off the couch and participating in life can be overwhelming, but I would encourage you to do whatever you can to have fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, one of my favorite things to do is to watch movies and needlepoint. Some people like to dance or hike, or take an art class. All things that bring them joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what is fun for you? If getting out and doing things in the world is daunting right now, find something fun you can do at home, something that might very well pull you out of any funk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/things-quietly-unhappy-wives-do-throughout-day"&gt;10 Things Quietly Unhappy Wives Do Throughout The Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10.

The act of smiling has also been proven to improve your mood and increase happy thoughts. I know when my kids were little, smiling at them was a key to helping me get through my day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yawning helps cool down the brain and makes you feel calm.. Laughing, like smiling, can reduce your anxiety level, which will only help you manage your moods and feel happier. So, as you can see, there are little things that you can do every day to help manage your mental health and stay eternally youthful.

For many, hitting 10,000 steps in a day has become a marker of good health — a goal that prompts post-dinner walks, lunchtime laps around the block and a reason to park a little farther away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the target is widely embraced by doctors and their patients, its origins are less scientific than some may expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The whole idea behind the 10,000 steps was actually a marketing campaign for a company in Japan that developed a pedometer,” said David Raichlen, professor of biological sciences and anthropology at USC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of walking 10,000 steps a day gained popularity in Japan in the 1960s, when a company introduced a pedometer called the Manpo-kei — a name that translates to “10,000 step meter.” Released around the time of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, the product gave people a numerical goal and helped sell pedometers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was kind of brilliant,” Raichlen said. “Is it arbitrary?

Schaben / Los Angeles Times)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers say that even if the number wasn’t evidence-based at the time, it caught on for a reason — and may have landed close to a meaningful benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It turns out, bizarrely enough, they probably weren’t that far off, even though they did not have any of the epidemiological data to support it at the time,” Raichlen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the years since the 10,000 step target gained attraction, researchers have tried to pinpoint how many daily steps are actually linked to better health outcomes. Some studies show that benefits such as reduced risk of cardiovascular disease begin around 2,500 to 3,000 steps a day. Others suggest a plateau of health-related benefits begins around 7,500 steps, Raichlen said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, many public health messages continue to promote the five-digit mark, and fitness trackers, including Fitbits and other smart devices, often set 10,000 steps as the default daily goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gregg C. Fonarow, interim chief of cardiology at UCLA, said step counts are a practical, easy-to-understand way to communicate physical activity guidelines with patients. He often recommends 10,000 steps and doesn’t view the number as random.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Conveying step count is one of the ways of quantifying, easily and understandably, a trackable, actionable way to communicate what would be a good level of physical activity for them,” Fonarow said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-left&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/75cde1f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/543x371+0+0/resize/320x219!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fcc%2Fcc9384944566890bbecba82669ea%2Fwalking-10000-steps-google-trends.png 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/edb133a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/543x371+0+0/resize/568x388!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fcc%2Fcc9384944566890bbecba82669ea%2Fwalking-10000-steps-google-trends.png 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/91066da/2147483647/strip/true/crop/543x371+0+0/resize/768x525!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fcc%2Fcc9384944566890bbecba82669ea%2Fwalking-10000-steps-google-trends.png 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3dbd0dc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/543x371+0+0/resize/1024x700!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fcc%2Fcc9384944566890bbecba82669ea%2Fwalking-10000-steps-google-trends.png 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bc6bbf0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/543x371+0+0/resize/1200x820!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fcc%2Fcc9384944566890bbecba82669ea%2Fwalking-10000-steps-google-trends.png 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt='Searches for "walking 10000 steps" have increased over the past five years.' srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ed1605c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/543x371+0+0/resize/320x219!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fcc%2Fcc9384944566890bbecba82669ea%2Fwalking-10000-steps-google-trends.png 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/27813b8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/543x371+0+0/resize/568x388!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fcc%2Fcc9384944566890bbecba82669ea%2Fwalking-10000-steps-google-trends.png 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/331efef/2147483647/strip/true/crop/543x371+0+0/resize/768x525!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fcc%2Fcc9384944566890bbecba82669ea%2Fwalking-10000-steps-google-trends.png 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5599e5f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/543x371+0+0/resize/1024x700!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fcc%2Fcc9384944566890bbecba82669ea%2Fwalking-10000-steps-google-trends.png 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/440a30a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/543x371+0+0/resize/1200x820!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fcc%2Fcc9384944566890bbecba82669ea%2Fwalking-10000-steps-google-trends.png 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/440a30a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/543x371+0+0/resize/1200x820!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fcc%2Fcc9384944566890bbecba82669ea%2Fwalking-10000-steps-google-trends.png" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Searches for “walking 10000 steps” have increased over the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Google Trends)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said 10,000 steps equals roughly five miles of walking and about 150 minutes of moderate-to-intense activity — in line with existing guidelines for weekly exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Fonarow acknowledges that research findings vary. He cites one study that found risk reduction plateaued around 7,500 steps for older women, while other studies have found benefit continuing through 10,000 steps or more. “Walking is a fantastic form of exercise,” Fonarow said. “It improves blood pressure, supports brain health, reduces insulin resistance and helps strengthen the blood vessels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raichlen said he typically avoids prescribing specific thresholds. While 10,000 steps may be a useful goal for some, he said, it is not a requirement for good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A little bit is better than nothing, and then a little bit more is better than that,” Raichlen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the type of walking matters. Researchers have found that cadence — how many steps a person takes per minute — can influence the impact of physical activity. A brisk walk offers greater cardiovascular benefit than a slower pace even with the same total step count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ad963c9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7274x4850+0+0/resize/320x213!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F75%2F2b%2F6a9a754246e69e9cbefae8fd30dc%2F1328348-tr-0729-walking-in-la-009-ik-1.JPG 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/25ba623/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7274x4850+0+0/resize/568x379!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F75%2F2b%2F6a9a754246e69e9cbefae8fd30dc%2F1328348-tr-0729-walking-in-la-009-ik-1.JPG 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/313fae1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7274x4850+0+0/resize/768x512!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F75%2F2b%2F6a9a754246e69e9cbefae8fd30dc%2F1328348-tr-0729-walking-in-la-009-ik-1.JPG 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9da03ed/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7274x4850+0+0/resize/1024x683!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F75%2F2b%2F6a9a754246e69e9cbefae8fd30dc%2F1328348-tr-0729-walking-in-la-009-ik-1.JPG 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1162525/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7274x4850+0+0/resize/1200x800!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F75%2F2b%2F6a9a754246e69e9cbefae8fd30dc%2F1328348-tr-0729-walking-in-la-009-ik-1.JPG 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="One man in a white shirt and another in a blue one on their 41-miles of walking across Los Angeles." srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/631726b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7274x4850+0+0/resize/320x213!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F75%2F2b%2F6a9a754246e69e9cbefae8fd30dc%2F1328348-tr-0729-walking-in-la-009-ik-1.JPG 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5cb3ec4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7274x4850+0+0/resize/568x379!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F75%2F2b%2F6a9a754246e69e9cbefae8fd30dc%2F1328348-tr-0729-walking-in-la-009-ik-1.JPG 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5f0bff1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7274x4850+0+0/resize/768x512!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F75%2F2b%2F6a9a754246e69e9cbefae8fd30dc%2F1328348-tr-0729-walking-in-la-009-ik-1.JPG 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c714820/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7274x4850+0+0/resize/1024x683!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F75%2F2b%2F6a9a754246e69e9cbefae8fd30dc%2F1328348-tr-0729-walking-in-la-009-ik-1.JPG 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9918d8d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7274x4850+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F75%2F2b%2F6a9a754246e69e9cbefae8fd30dc%2F1328348-tr-0729-walking-in-la-009-ik-1.JPG 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9918d8d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7274x4850+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F75%2F2b%2F6a9a754246e69e9cbefae8fd30dc%2F1328348-tr-0729-walking-in-la-009-ik-1.JPG" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;Wes Brumbaugh, left, and Tucker O’Neill get in some steps on their 41-mile walk across Los Angeles.

For those who are largely sedentary, trying to walk 10,000 steps on day one may not be practical. “We really need to personalize these recommendations,” he said, adding that some people may choose to add resistance — like a weighted backpack — for additional benefits, but it’s not necessary for improved health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/68856ae/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7744x4947+0+0/resize/320x205!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2F65%2F16be570347798eddab15a175b92d%2F1479733-wk-1102-walking-groups-la-culver-city-cmh-03.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/647ed14/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7744x4947+0+0/resize/568x363!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2F65%2F16be570347798eddab15a175b92d%2F1479733-wk-1102-walking-groups-la-culver-city-cmh-03.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/49c048c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7744x4947+0+0/resize/768x491!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2F65%2F16be570347798eddab15a175b92d%2F1479733-wk-1102-walking-groups-la-culver-city-cmh-03.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/872893b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7744x4947+0+0/resize/1024x655!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2F65%2F16be570347798eddab15a175b92d%2F1479733-wk-1102-walking-groups-la-culver-city-cmh-03.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6730b9e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7744x4947+0+0/resize/1200x767!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2F65%2F16be570347798eddab15a175b92d%2F1479733-wk-1102-walking-groups-la-culver-city-cmh-03.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="A group of people walking." srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3b2ebd9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7744x4947+0+0/resize/320x205!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2F65%2F16be570347798eddab15a175b92d%2F1479733-wk-1102-walking-groups-la-culver-city-cmh-03.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/af70699/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7744x4947+0+0/resize/568x363!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2F65%2F16be570347798eddab15a175b92d%2F1479733-wk-1102-walking-groups-la-culver-city-cmh-03.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3c7886e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7744x4947+0+0/resize/768x491!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2F65%2F16be570347798eddab15a175b92d%2F1479733-wk-1102-walking-groups-la-culver-city-cmh-03.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/27b5c41/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7744x4947+0+0/resize/1024x655!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2F65%2F16be570347798eddab15a175b92d%2F1479733-wk-1102-walking-groups-la-culver-city-cmh-03.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/04265a1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7744x4947+0+0/resize/1200x767!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2F65%2F16be570347798eddab15a175b92d%2F1479733-wk-1102-walking-groups-la-culver-city-cmh-03.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/04265a1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7744x4947+0+0/resize/1200x767!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2F65%2F16be570347798eddab15a175b92d%2F1479733-wk-1102-walking-groups-la-culver-city-cmh-03.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;The Culver City EverWalk Walking Club, one of several walking groups in L.A., usually meets on the first Saturday of every month.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Christina House / Los Angeles Times)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Parveen Garg of Keck Medicine of USC also sees patients aiming to meet step goals. While spreading activity throughout the week is ideal, he said it’s fine if some days are more active than others. For patients with limited time or energy, walking more on the weekends or during longer breaks can still offer meaningful benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garg said he reminds patients that walking is beneficial even at lower levels. Multiple studies show that risk of cardiovascular disease and premature death decreases measurably beginning around 2,500 steps per day, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While spreading activity throughout the week is ideal, he said it’s fine if some days are more active than others. For patients with limited time or energy, walking more on the weekends or during longer breaks can still offer meaningful benefits. Like other experts, Garg emphasizes that the benefits of movement don’t begin at 10,000 steps — they can start much earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As humans, we like goals,” Garg said. “We like to feel like we’ve accomplished something. We like to check off boxes. … It does give people a goal to accomplish. In that aspect, it’s really great — as long as it does not discourage people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He encourages his patients to prioritize aerobic activity — movement that gets the heart rate up — even if it’s done in short bursts or mixed into daily routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether a person walks 2,000 steps or 10,000, local experts agree the key is consistency, and increasing activity over time can be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just keep moving,” Raichlen said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 17:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNV0pXUmw4azdkYk1SV3E4OU5sUHBtQVVnRTFWTlFtNUpaQThZQW9VRDhvYzh2Sy0yVEtfT3lhOEdtcG1RNnhWMG00ZlFrbHVWcDNCTWktamFCMWw1Wm4wUjA3MkVQQzk4dzBnRUVvelhLWk5uYkxQd01YMTF4NEZlRWJrVDloSDhPYlB0dmFoQlM</guid></item><item><title>“麻疹真的是一次飞机之旅” ：专家警告夏季旅行期间爆发-卫报 | ‘Measles really is an airplane ride away’: experts warn of outbreak amid summer travel - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxPak1OcXV1RXMzTDBHS2RaUzdFdEU1WU9oTEFOck90SFFHdmU4RmtOYzAzeDd4Wkl3akZHd3VPbm9JOGJ1NHcxNlFuUl9nb1p3eFlwUlpWLV9FWFFIWDJkRVZfZ25DOHJhVFpnRjJmNk1mbkViYWgwWm40OElSXzNaeQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The US is in the midst of the worst measles outbreak in 33 years, according to figures released this week. Driven by an outbreak in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, the US has now seen more measles cases in 2025 than in any year since 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Experts said they expect the growth in measles cases to continue, spurred on in part by the summer travel season.

However, experts warn the US may be entering a “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/03/measles-post-herd-immunity" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;post-herd immunity&lt;/a&gt;” era after the Covid-19 pandemic, which &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/29/childhood-immunisation-plummeted-pandemic" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;disrupted&lt;/a&gt; routine childhood immunization visits, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/annual-measles-cases-record" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;supercharged&lt;/a&gt; the reach of anti-vaccine groups and saw the rise of a wellness influencer culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Measles really is an airplane ride away. It’s a car ride away. The reason we haven’t had it for 20 years is because of the high vaccination rates,” Katherine Wells, director of public health for the city of Lubbock, Texas, told &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/09/measles-america-breaks-33-year-record-anti-vaccine-sentiment-key-factor-behind-outbreaks/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Stat News&lt;/a&gt;. “And as soon as we start seeing that drop again, we have more vulnerable people, and that gives measles places to spread.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to medicine. It causes a characteristic top-down rash, runny nose, high fever and red, puffy eyes. Although most people recover from the disease, it hospitalizes as many as one in five and causes pneumonia in one in 20 children, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. It can also cause serious complications, including brain swelling leading to permanent disability in one in 1,000 children and death in 1-3 in 1,000 children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Health officials have reported 1,297 confirmed cases of measles in 2025, according to a &lt;a href="https://cori.centerforhealthsecurity.org/resources/measles-outbreak-response" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;dashboard&lt;/a&gt; from the Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Outbreak Response Innovation on Friday. The figures are slightly higher than those reported by federal health authorities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;), which reported 1,288 cases, but last updated their tally on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Both of those figures exceed the 1,274 cases reported in all of 2019. The next highest recent year was 1992, when 2,126 cases were reported. Importantly, that was before the US reached measles elimination status in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Three people have died in the 2025 outbreak, including two unvaccinated but otherwise healthy children in &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, and one unvaccinated adult in &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/alert/2025/3/?view=2188" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, according to state health authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;North Dakota is just one example of how difficult it has been for states to prevent measles cases. The state had just hit the 42-day milestone without any new cases – a federally set limit to declare the end to an outbreak – when an unvaccinated person traveled out of state and contracted the disease, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.inforum.com/health/north-dakota-reports-first-case-of-measles-in-more-than-a-month-just-as-it-reached-outbreak-over-milestone" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;InForum&lt;/a&gt;, a local news outlet in North Dakota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, one of the world’s best-known vaccine skeptics, has also disrupted US vaccine policy and spread &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/01/rfk-mmr-vaccines-fetus-claim" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;inflammatory information&lt;/a&gt; about the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In June, Kennedy fired all &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/10/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-panel" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;17 members&lt;/a&gt; of a vaccine advisory panel that is a key link in the distribution pipeline, and stacked the committee with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/13/eight-new-cdc-vaccine-advisers-robert-f-kennedy" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;seven ideological allies&lt;/a&gt;. The group declared in its &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/25/cdc-vaccine-panel-rfk-acip" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;first meeting&lt;/a&gt; that it would review the schedule of childhood vaccines and review older vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy’s changes to federal vaccine policy are now the subject of a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/pregnant-doctor-covid-19-vaccine-rfk-jr-trump" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;lawsuit by a pregnant physician&lt;/a&gt; who was denied a Covid-19 vaccine. Kennedy unilaterally declared Covid-19 vaccines would no longer be recommended for healthy pregnant women, despite many studies showing they are at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 17:27:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPak1OcXV1RXMzTDBHS2RaUzdFdEU1WU9oTEFOck90SFFHdmU4RmtOYzAzeDd4Wkl3akZHd3VPbm9JOGJ1NHcxNlFuUl9nb1p3eFlwUlpWLV9FWFFIWDJkRVZfZ25DOHJhVFpnRjJmNk1mbkViYWgwWm40OElSXzNaeQ</guid></item><item><title>你应该服用肌酸吗？ -《经济学人》 | Should you take creatine? - The Economist</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxNVm05U19iSWpoUjJJOEFoenF5N2RSZmtLLWZxdUs2dS1oUVp3Z3lhaEg0dFZjblVMWTlNbEpfaklpWXVya1pyQVhwSmJJb2JRZU5vOWNQblVydkxFanh4V1F4clJMcjZYYTdPYVVMTVpCNk84RkdBRThZLUpMTFB4NGQ3aXFBdDNvamNsVw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-5nzj3w ei2yr3n1"&gt;&lt;p data-component="paragraph" class="css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0"&gt;&lt;span data-caps="initial"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;F YOU are&lt;/small&gt; an athlete in search of a chemical boost your options are limited.

She figured it would go away like any other pimple eventually does. It started turning red in December 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She brought it up to her dermatologist at her next visit, Dr Hooman Khorasani, a dermatologic and cosmetic surgeon based in New York. When Dr Khorasani examined the spot under a microscope, he thought it looked suspicious. He could see certain blood vessels not seen in normal acne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After collecting a small bit of tissue and running some tests, Dr Khorasani called Haley with crushing news: the spot was basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the most common form of skin cancer. It results from specific mutations in skin cells and, while they can be sporadic, they’re generally a result of exposure to UV radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hearing the word cancer come out of her doctor’s mouth was scary, but he assured her that, because they caught the cancer early, she had an excellent prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;BCC grows slowly and seldom metastasizes. When caught early, localized cases are typically curable, with a near 100 percent five-year survival rate—among the highest of all cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Haley had surgery scheduled for a few weeks after her diagnosis. Dr. Khorasani would perform &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11623929/Jill-Biden-71-undergo-preventative-skin-cancer-surgery-Mohs-procedure-like.html"&gt;a Mohs micrographic surgery&lt;/a&gt; on her forehead, which involves removing thin layers of tissue very precisely, continually checking the layers under a microscope until all the cancerous cells have been eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A year after noticing a persistent spot, Emily Haley assumed it was just a pimple, but when it turned red in December 2024, her dermatologist, Dr. Hooman Khorasani, examined it and found abnormal blood vessels. A biopsy confirmed basal cell carcinoma (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even Haley’s doctor was hesitant to believe the small red bump was cancer. Haley was only 31, and the age group most often diagnosed with this type of cancer is 70 to 79-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Haley had a family history on both sides. Her mother developed the same kind of cancer in her 60s, about seven years ago, and her dad developed precancerous skin growths when he was in his 50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.aol.com/thought-just-zit-actual-diagnosis-202500735.html"&gt;Women’s Health&lt;/a&gt;: ‘My family history combined with my alabaster skin made it feel almost unavoidable that I’d face a similar fate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But in an attempt to protect myself, I stuck to my sunscreen routine, never used tanning beds, and visited a dermatologist annually for skin cancer screenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Developing basal cell carcinoma despite my good habits (and getting diagnosed decades earlier in life than my parents) came as a shock. It was a stark reminder that skin cancer can happen to anyone at any time.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was initially concerned about the scar that would result from the Mohs surgery. Some degree of scarring is to be expected, but as a marketing professional in the beauty industry, minimizing the signs of her cancer was important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The state of my scar and the various bandages covering it naturally drew attention, but not necessarily the kind I wanted,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I didn’t always feel like explaining myself or revealing that I had been dealing with cancer. However, I’m comforted by the fact that this phase in my life won’t last forever.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The graph shows he increase in skin cancer cases over a 25 year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;BCC is far more common than its deadly cousin melanoma, with around 5.4 million diagnoses made every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Generally related to sun exposure, the cancer develops when cells in the upper layer of the skin begin to divide uncontrollably, forming a pinkish patch that might be tender or itchy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors are typically able to remove it via Mohs surgery, which bumps the survival rate up to 99 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's also becoming more common. According to the NIH, case rates have risen between 20 and 80 percent over the last 30 years, especially among the ever-growing senior population.  &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Khorasani continues to perform outpatient procedures to smooth out the scar, including Dermabrasion and CO₂ laser resurfacing, which remove outer skin layers and stimulate collagen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vascular lasers reduce redness by targeting blood vessels, while Bellafill injections fill in raised or indented scars. Botox can prevent scar stretching by relaxing nearby muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Haley said: ‘Nevertheless, the healing process since the surgery hasn’t always been picture-perfect (my scar looks especially red immediately after treatments), but on good days, I’m happy to say that you’d hardly know the scar is there thanks to all the help from my doctor and his team.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since the scare, she has become much more diligent about protecting her skin, reapplying SPF throughout the day, wearing hats and rash guards at the beach, and visiting her dermatologist for comprehensive body exams every six months, as recommended by the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Signs of skin cancer range from innocuous to obvious, but experts warn that treating cases early is key to making sure they do not spread or further develop&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The clinic she goes to uses artificial intelligence to analyze high-quality photos of her whole body to determine whether she has developed any cancerous moles.

&lt;p&gt;MAHARASHTRA, INDIA — After working in a sugarcane field for an hour, Shakuntala Admane began to feel lightheaded, but she persisted for another four hours. Then, as the temperature soared above 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius), she collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical tests later confirmed that the 60-year-old agricultural worker had &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000394.htm" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000394.htm" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hyponatremia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a condition in which the sodium level in the blood falls too low.

It found that cases of hyponatremia surged as the heat index — a measure of what temperatures "feel like" when humidity is taken into account — climbed above their typical levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of climate change, in the past 12 months alone, Germany has experienced nearly double the days of extreme heat that it would have in a world without climate change, according to a report by &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.climatecentral.org/report/climate-change-and-the-escalation-of-global-extreme-heat-2025" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.climatecentral.org/report/climate-change-and-the-escalation-of-global-extreme-heat-2025" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;World Weather Attribution, the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, and Climate Central&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a Swedish study published in March in the&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://journals.lww.com/jasn/fulltext/2025/03000/the_association_of_outdoor_temperature_with_severe.13.aspx" target="_blank" data-url="https://journals.lww.com/jasn/fulltext/2025/03000/the_association_of_outdoor_temperature_with_severe.13.aspx" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Journal of the American Society of Nephrology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pulled blood test results from all patients who had their sodium levels checked in Stockholm County between 2005 and 2018. They found a sharp rise in cases when outdoor temperatures exceeded 68 F (20 C), which is warm for the Scandinavian country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweden, too, has seen a rise in hot days.

At its root, hyponatremia — when blood sodium concentrations fall below &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/hyponatremia-low-sodium-level-blood" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/hyponatremia-low-sodium-level-blood" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;135 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — is an imbalance between the body's sodium and water levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During hot weather, people sweat to cool off. In doing so, they shed both water and electrolytes, such as sodium. If sodium levels in the blood drop too low, the body normally counteracts this imbalance by flushing out water in urine. However, if blood volumes are also low, the body is at risk of dehydration, so the body releases hormones to retain water. This water retention &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470386/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470386/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;can worsen the sodium imbalance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="risk-factors-3"&gt;Risk factors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common medications can &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9572915/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9572915/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;worsen this heat-hyponatremia feedback loop&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, often by triggering the release of hormones that fuel water retention. In a 2018 paper published in&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/104/4/1304/5185200" target="_blank" data-url="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/104/4/1304/5185200" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researchers noted that individuals taking diuretics — medications that help the body eliminate excess water, but also flush out electrolytes — are more likely to develop hyponatremia during hot weather than during milder weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At higher outdoor temperatures, the combination of diuretic use, sweating, and low fluid and electrolyte intake may increase the risk of hyponatremia, the researchers wrote in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://mrc.charite.de/en/research/kapperts_lab" target="_blank" data-url="https://mrc.charite.de/en/research/kapperts_lab" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Kai Kappert&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at Charité University Medicine in Berlin and one of the authors of the German study, agreed. In an email, he told Live Science that electrolyte imbalances triggered by heat may be worsened by people rehydrating with low-sodium liquids such as water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Sugarcane cutters load the harvested sugarcane onto a trolley amid sweltering temperatures in western Maharashtra. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Sanket Jain)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mannheimer told Live Science that older adults and those with frailty are prone to developing hyponatremia because they are more likely to have other medical conditions and be taking prescribed medications. Beyond diuretics, other common medications, such as antidepressants, antipsychotics and anticonvulsants, can also raise the risk of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Periods of high temperature can be seen as another factor that is added to the increased overall risk that may affect the elderly disproportionately more," Mannheimer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At baseline, aging might also reduce the body's ability to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6098859/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6098859/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;handle heat&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3682932/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3682932/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;eliminate excess water.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, health problems that grow more common in old age — like kidney disease, infections or &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8370306/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8370306/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cancer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — can put older adults at risk of hyponatremia.

Instead, he advocated for a balanced approach to fluid intake, meaning drinking enough water to stay hydrated while also replacing lost electrolytes, especially sodium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;With rising temperatures, Jayashree Pandav says episodes of hyponatremia have become more frequent, affecting her health and routine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Sanket Jain)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kappert emphasized that the public should be informed about the increased risk of hyponatremia during heat waves and suggested that people take precautions to reduce heat exposure. That's challenging for agricultural workers like Admane, who must spend hours toiling in the fields to make ends meet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as the climate warms, that will become a bigger problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years ago, Admane could work at least eight hours a day without problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, "if I work in the fields today in extreme heat, I can't work the next day. First, I have to either take medicines or an electrolyte solution given through a drip, and only then can I work," Admane told Live Science. "Now, even working for four hours has become difficult."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Admane's daughter, Jayashree Pandav, 40, lives and works with her and has also been experiencing episodes of hyponatremia over the past year, which she believes are triggered by prolonged exposure to extreme heat. She works at least 10 hours a day in the fields, but lately, it's been getting more difficult for her to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Frequent doctor visits have now become a common part of any farmworker's life," she told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the popularity of weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy has soared so dramatically that they’ve inspired new vocabulary, spurred global shortages, and prompted moral debates. Prescription growth hit 13% in just three months, with 2 million Americans now using the drug. Marketed as “miracle drugs,” these medications, part of a class called GLP-1 receptor agonists, have transformed how doctors treat diabetes, obesity, and &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/ozempic-users-are-seeing-a-surprising-drop-in-alcohol-and-drug-cravings/"&gt;even addiction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But as millions jump the GLP-1 drug bandwagon, the scale of these drugs’ side effects has become increasingly apparent. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using data from over two million patients, scientists at the Washington University School of Medicine and the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System have built what they call an “atlas” of the drugs’ effects on the human body. The study is one of the most comprehensive investigations yet into GLP-1 drugs, tracking 175 health outcomes across all major organ systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our approach has allowed us to build a comprehensive atlas mapping the associations of GLP-1RA spanning all organ systems,” said Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, the study’s senior author and a clinical epidemiologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-potential-benefits"&gt;Potential Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 drugs like semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy) were originally designed to mimic hormones that stimulate insulin release, helping patients with type 2 diabetes. But they quickly became famous for their ability to trigger significant weight loss by suppressing appetite and slowing digestion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials showed cardiovascular benefits and improved kidney function. But many of those trials only monitored patients for a few months and tested a narrow range of outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Al-Aly’s team wanted to take a broader view.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, they pulled anonymized data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, focusing on 215,970 people who started taking GLP-1 drugs between 2017 and 2023. They compared their health outcomes to those of over a million people using other diabetes medications or receiving standard care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compared to standard care, GLP-1 drugs were associated with a &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; risk of 42 different conditions, including heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure, respiratory infections, and even Alzheimer’s disease. The drugs also appeared to reduce substance use disorders — including alcohol, cannabis, opioids, and stimulants — and even cut the risk of suicide attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The effect sizes were modest, often ranging between 10% and 20% risk reductions. But across such a wide array of conditions, the cumulative impact could be substantial.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These drugs act on receptors throughout the brain and body,” said Al-Aly. “That might explain why we’re seeing effects far beyond blood sugar or weight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Animal studies support that theory. GLP-1 drugs &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9455625/"&gt;reduce inflammation in the brain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8820218/"&gt;interfere with reward pathways&lt;/a&gt; linked to addiction. Human data from the new study suggests they also lower the risk of seizures, bulimia, schizophrenia, and suicidal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s a growing body of research suggesting GLP-1 drugs might serve as adjuvants for treating neuropsychiatric conditions,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And they’re not alone in this speculation. &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/obesity/news/20240715/ozempic-may-protect-against-cognitive-decline-and-addiction"&gt;Other researchers are already exploring&lt;/a&gt; whether these drugs might be used to treat addiction or even prevent cognitive decline in aging populations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="but-not-without-risks"&gt;But Not Without Risks&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, no medicine that touches so many systems can do so without consequences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study found an &lt;em&gt;increased&lt;/em&gt; risk for 19 outcomes, some of them serious.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Users had higher rates of gastrointestinal problems like nausea, vomiting, GERD (acid reflux), and abdominal pain. More worryingly, they were also more likely to suffer from pancreatitis (a painful and potentially fatal inflammation of the pancreas), kidney stones, and kidney inflammation. The risk of acute drug-induced pancreatitis was more than twice that of non-users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vision changes and other musculoskeletal issues, like arthritis and tendinitis, were also noted. Sleep disturbances, syncope (fainting), and headaches were among the subtler but still significant concerns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These side effects aren’t entirely new. Reports of nausea and “Ozempic face” — a term coined for the rapid facial fat loss some users experience — have circulated for years. But this is the first time such a large and systematic evaluation has mapped the full scope of possible risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ozempic-face.webp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ozempic-face-1024x576.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-286855" srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ozempic-face-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ozempic-face-750x422.webp 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ozempic-face.webp 1099w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rarer side effects may emerge as more patients take these medicines in clinical practice,” &lt;a href="https://www.dw.com/en/weight-loss-drugs-linked-with-growing-number-of-side-effects/a-73229511?maca=en-GK-RSS-en-teaser-Flipboard-Sci_Tech-21405-xml-media"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; Penny Ward, a physician at King’s College London. “This is why we continue to monitor the safety of medicines on the market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the UK, regulators have linked &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/06/26/weight-loss-jabs-linked-pancreas-problems-after-10-deaths/"&gt;at least ten deaths to GLP-1-related pancreatitis&lt;/a&gt;. And while side effects like NAION (a rare optic nerve condition that can cause blindness) remain uncommon, studies now suggest a fourfold increase in risk among diabetic users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-balancing-act"&gt;A Balancing Act&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the concerns, researchers aren’t calling for restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The list of benefits for this drug, if taken as prescribed, is still significantly longer and more impactful than risks,” Karolina Skibicka, a neuroendocrinologist at the University of Calgary, told &lt;em&gt;DW&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But she added an important caveat: “We need studies which include women. Women show unique side-effects to many pharmacotherapies, and still in most studies women are often underrepresented at various stages of testing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s a known limitation of the current study, which was conducted using VA health records, a system whose patient base is disproportionately male. Only about 5% of participants were women.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that may not be the only blind spot. Because the drugs are increasingly used for obesity rather than diabetes, the dosages and durations are often higher and longer than in original trials. “More data is needed about those taking the drug for obesity,” Skibicka said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Al-Aly agrees. He emphasizes that the findings should not discourage use but instead guide safer prescriptions and spur targeted research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“GLP-1RA drugs can have broad health benefits,” he said. “However, they are not without risks. Our findings underscore the possibility for wider applications for these medications but also highlight important risks that should be carefully monitored.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="where-do-we-go-from-here"&gt;Where Do We Go from Here?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, the drugs are here to stay. One in eight U.S. adults has already taken a GLP-1 drug at least once, and demand continues to grow globally.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the new atlas of side effects and benefits offers a way forward not just for better prescribing practices, but for understanding the full biological reach of a molecule originally intended to control blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As more data emerges, that insight might help scientists repurpose GLP-1 drugs in ways we’re only beginning to imagine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After all, a molecule that reshapes the risk of Alzheimer’s, addiction, and cardiovascular disease, all at once? That’s not something we can afford to easily ignore. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings appeared in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03412-w"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In 2024 alone, global spending on anti-aging products was roughly $74 billion. But what if the key to slower aging and longer life hides in psilocybin, the compound found in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/religious-leaders-tried-psilocybin-and-it-changed-their-lives/"&gt;psychedelic mushrooms&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sounds strange. Yet science now says it might be true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at &lt;a href="https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Emory University&lt;/a&gt; made a surprising discovery. They found that psilocin, a compound your body produces after eating psychedelic mushrooms, could actually slow down aging in cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their study appeared in &lt;em&gt;npj Aging&lt;/em&gt;, and the results stunned even the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-psilocybin-the-basics"&gt;Understanding psilocybin – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the body converts psilocybin into psilocin, it binds to serotonin receptors, altering perception, mood, and cognition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-before-psilocybin-mushrooms-brain-on-psilocybin-mushrooms-any-questions/"&gt;Brain imaging shows&lt;/a&gt; that under psilocybin, rigid brain networks loosen their grip, allowing parts of the brain that don’t usually communicate to connect in unexpected ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This rewiring effect can temporarily dissolve the ego and create a sense of unity or interconnectedness, often described as a profound spiritual experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-psilocybin-mushrooms-got-their-magic/"&gt;the magic&lt;/a&gt; isn’t just in the moment – it’s in what comes after. Clinical studies show that a single guided psilocybin session can ease symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD, sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/psilocybin-may-boost-our-ability-to-learn-and-explore/"&gt;with lasting effects&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists believe this happens because psilocybin disrupts entrenched thought loops and gives people a window to view their life and habits from a new angle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined with therapy, it can help someone reframe trauma or break out of destructive mental patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-study-psilocybin-and-aging"&gt;How to study psilocybin and aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers grew human lung and skin cells and added psilocin. Normally, these cells grow &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/healthy-aging-how-some-people-live-past-100-years/"&gt;old&lt;/a&gt; and stop dividing. But this time, something else happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a lower dose, cells lived almost 30% longer. A higher dose pushed that to more than 50%. The &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-are-experimenting-with-new-approach-to-fight-and-stop-human-aging-necrosis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cells stayed active&lt;/a&gt;. They kept dividing far longer. They showed fewer signs of stress and less damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treated cells had more sirtuin1, a protein that helps cells survive stress. They also showed less DNA damage. And there was another surprise – these cells kept their telomeres intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Telomere" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Telomeres&lt;/a&gt; protect DNA from damage. As people grow older, telomeres shrink, leading to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/organ-aging-can-predict-diseases-decades-in-advance/"&gt;age&lt;/a&gt;-related diseases. In this study, psilocin stopped that shrinkage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mice-lived-longer-with-psilocybin"&gt;Mice lived longer with psilocybin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists tossed around the “psilocybin-telomere hypothesis.” They suspected psychedelics could help protect telomeres and slow aging. But no one had ever proved it. Until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t just a lab trick. The team also tested psilocybin in aging mice, equal in age to 60 to 65-year-old humans. First, the mice got a low dose of psilocybin. Then they received higher doses once a month for ten months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They waited and watched. The outcome was hard to ignore. About 80% of the treated mice survived the entire study. In the untreated group, only half survived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treated mice also looked healthier. They had better fur, fewer white hairs, and even some new hair &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/defying-time-three-ways-to-slow-biological-aging/"&gt;growth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-cells-stay-younger"&gt;How cells stay younger&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psilocybin activates serotonin receptors. These receptors are not just in the brain – they are everywhere in the body. They exist in the heart, lungs, skin, immune cells, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, psilocin boosted &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/sirtuin-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sirtuin1&lt;/a&gt; in cells. This protein helps the body manage oxidative stress. Less stress meant cells stayed younger for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers now believe psilocybin touches many aging pathways. It protects DNA, lowers stress, preserves telomeres, and may slow aging itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-psilocybin-may-improve-aging-even-later"&gt;Psilocybin may improve aging even later&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most cells in the body express &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-dopamine-and-serotonin-shape-behavior/"&gt;serotonin&lt;/a&gt; receptors, and this study opens a new frontier for how psilocybin could influence systemic aging processes, particularly when administered later in life,” said study co-author Dr. Louise Hecker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her words say it all: this isn’t just about mental health anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study opens new questions about what long-term treatments can do. Additionally, even when the intervention is initiated late in life in mice, it still leads to improved survival, which is clinically relevant in healthy aging,” Hecker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message is clear: it’s never too late to change how we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-better-way-to-age"&gt;A better way to age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery comes at a crucial time. A recent report showed that life expectancy in the United States still falls behind other countries. Americans not only live shorter lives but also struggle with quality in later years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study provides strong preclinical evidence that psilocybin may contribute to healthier aging, not just a longer lifespan, but a better quality of life in later years,” says study co-author Dr. Ali John Zarrabi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zarrabi worries about extending life without improving well-being. He doesn’t want people trapped in bodies that no longer work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a palliative care physician-scientist, one of my biggest concerns is prolonging life at the cost of dignity and function. But these mice weren’t just surviving longer. They experienced better aging,” said Zarrabi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His words strike a deep chord. Aging isn’t only about years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-just-the-beginning-for-psilocybin"&gt;Just the beginning for psilocybin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers know their work is just beginning. They must study psilocybin in humans. They need to find the safest doses and study long-term effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are hurdles. Psilocybin is a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/millions-americans-are-microdosing-psilocybin-mdma-cannabis-lsd/"&gt;controlled substance&lt;/a&gt;. Getting approval and funding takes effort. But many researchers remain hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psilocybin already holds FDA “breakthrough therapy” status for depression.

But while symptoms usually appear within 3 to 30 days, the illness can quietly linger and wreak havoc if not treated properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lyme disease is rarely fatal, with just 10 deaths reported in the US since 1985, but for those left untreated, the long-term consequences can be devastating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured above is a blacklegged tick, or deer tick, which can carry Lyme disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the study, published in the journal Frontiers in Medicine, the researchers extracted data from the Lyme Disease Biobank, which holds blood and saliva samples from people diagnosed with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They examined samples from 253 people from Long Island, New York, and Central Wisconsin, who were infected with Lyme disease between 2014 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All participants received antibiotics to treat their disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, 78 percent said they had no symptoms of Lyme Disease when they returned for their second test two to four weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But among the 22 percent who reported ongoing symptoms, most said they were no longer visiting their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 10 percent of people in North America are thought to&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-10916181/Nearly-10-people-North-America-deadly-tick-borne-illness-Lyme-disease.html"&gt; have been infected&lt;/a&gt; with Lyme disease at least once in their lives, data has shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those individuals have been left with serious complications after battling undiagnosed Lyme disease for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11231295/Woman-29-needs-16-joint-replacements-catching-Lyme-disease.html"&gt;In one case&lt;/a&gt;, Meghan Bradshaw, from Charlotte, North Carolina, revealed it took doctors four years to diagnose her illness, by which time Lyme disease had sparked arthritis in her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Meghan Bradshaw, from Charlotte in North Carolina, suffered what doctors said was the 'worst' case of Lyme disease-triggered arthritis they had seen.

Forgetting what time to pick up the kids. And he couldn’t remember the alarm code, the same one we had used for years.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul

programmes – rolled out in response to outbreaks of five major diseases – are believed to have reduced deaths by around 60% over a period of 23 years, according to a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/10/7/e016887" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A similar number of infections are also thought to have been prevented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Researchers believe that vaccinations stopped much bigger outbreaks of illnesses like Ebola, cholera and yellow fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The study also points to the significant economic benefits of vaccination programmes, which run into billions of dollars.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Researchers say this is the first comprehensive study to assess the impact of emergency vaccination programmes in response to the outbreak of five infectious diseases – Ebola, measles, cholera, yellow fever and meningitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They studied 210 different incidents from 2000 to 2023, covering 49 different countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The vaccine roll-outs seem to have had an impressive impact, reducing deaths by nearly 60%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The number of overall cases of theses infections were also reduced by nearly 60%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The swift deployment of vaccines also appears to have halted wider outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There were economic benefits too – worth an estimated $32 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;These benefits come mainly from averting deaths and years of life lost to disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But researchers believe this could be a significant underestimate of overall savings, as it doesn't take into account the costs of dealing with a wider outbreak, or the economic disruption caused by a more serious health emergency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It's believed the 2014 Ebola outbreak, which occurred before the existence of an approved vaccine, is estimated to have cost West African countries alone more than $53 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;The power of

responsible for many of the programmes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Sania Nishtar, the organisation's CEO, says the study shows just how important quick and effective vaccine roll-outs can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"For the first time, we are able to comprehensively quantify the benefit, in human and economic terms, of deploying vaccines against outbreaks of some of the deadliest infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"This study demonstrates clearly the power of vaccines as a cost-effective counter-measure to the increasing risk the world faces from outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It also underscores the importance of fully funding Gavi, so it can continue to protect communities in the next five years to come."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Gavi is currently trying to secure a fresh round of funding in the face of global cuts to foreign aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

                                &lt;p&gt;LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- A deceased bat found in Louisville tested positive for rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bat was found outside a home in Okolona, in the 40219 zip code, according to a news release Friday from officials with Louisville's health department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials with the Louisville Metro Department of Public Health and Wellness, remind residents that people can get rabies from bats through a bite or from its saliva. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://links-2.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmedia%2Freleases%2F2022%2Fp0106-human-rabies.html%3Futm_medium=email%26utm_source=govdelivery/1/010101917a2e593a-b74421ff-3319-4dd0-9703-a174122f78dc-000000/7ifp-0swE3QVPRxCgYSAUbFZh9zDIyyuks05s6ziYWY=367"&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, exposure to rabid bats is the leading cause of rabies in humans in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Transmission of rabies can occur through a bat's bite or the animal's saliva if it gets in a person's eyes, nose, mouth or an open wound," Connie Mendel, Louisville's chief health strategist, said in a news release Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mendel said sometimes people may not even know they've been bitten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly two dozen bats have tested positive for rabies in Jefferson County since 2019. Data from the Public Health and Wellness Lab shows that, since 2019, at least 21 bats have tested positive for rabies in Jefferson County:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2019: 4 bats &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2020: 2 (1 bat, 1 dog) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2021: 7 bats &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2022: 3 bats &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2023: 2 bats &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2024: 4 bats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rabies virus infects the central nervous system, and without appropriate medical care, it can cause disease in the brain which can result in death. &lt;a href="https://links-2.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Frabies%2Fhcp%2Fprevention-recommendations%2Fpost-exposure-prophylaxis.html%3FCDC_AAref_Val=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.cdc.gov%252Frabies%252Fmedical_care%252Findex.html%253Futm_medium%253Demail%2526utm_source%253Dgovdelivery%26utm_medium=email%26utm_source=govdelivery/1/010101917a2e593a-b74421ff-3319-4dd0-9703-a174122f78dc-000000/XxIJvFcfIhHC22jNaHj4V93s3DSkkg_toOaivi7s-p8=367" target="_blank"&gt;Preventative care&lt;/a&gt; after rabies exposure consists of a dose of human rabies immune globulin and the rabies vaccine series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment is recommended for both bite and non-bite exposures.

Their perception of time became distorted during exercise such that the external clock felt sluggish while their legs were flying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/336590/network"&gt;Andrew M. Edwards&lt;/a&gt;, a sports scientist at &lt;a href="https://www.canterbury.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Canterbury Christ Church University&lt;/a&gt;, led the research alongside collaborators at the &lt;a href="https://www.rug.nl/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Groningen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://vu.nl/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Vrije University&lt;/a&gt; of Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-time-is-not-time-during-exercise"&gt;Time is not time during exercise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise distorts time perception, the everyday sense of how long an event lasts. &lt;a href="https://www.keele.ac.uk/media/keeleuniversity/facnatsci/schpsych/weardenpublications/wearden2003.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Classic scalar expectancy&lt;/a&gt; theory proposes an internal pacemaker that fires pulses; count more pulses and a moment seems longer, count fewer and it shrinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During intense effort, sensory input and body signals grab attention, widening the attentional “gate” so extra pulses slip through and lengthen our subjective perception of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A complementary striatal beat frequency &lt;a href="https://scholarcommons.sc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1298&amp;amp;context=jscas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;model&lt;/a&gt; points to oscillations in the basal ganglia, a deep brain hub that also coordinates movement and reward, as a neural metronome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuro‑imaging shows overlapping circuits for timing and reward anticipation, hinting that the same dopamine‑rich loops flag both pace and pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inside-the-4-kilometer-pedal-test"&gt;Inside the 4‑kilometer pedal test&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty‑three recreational riders, none of them cyclists by trade, completed three four‑kilometer trials on a high‑precision ergometer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between sprints they estimated 30 seconds five times, giving a snapshot of the brain’s stopwatch before, during, and after exertion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was no difference between exercise conditions or &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/time-has-three-dimensions-and-space-is-just-a-byproduct-according-to-new-theory/"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; points,” the authors reported, emphasizing that competition alone did not reset the internal clock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether they rode solo, chased a passive avatar, or tried to beat an active opponent, the time warp held steady. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After finishing, their estimates snapped back to real‑world accuracy within two minutes, underscoring how tightly the illusion is tied to effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-your-brain-during-exercise"&gt;Your brain during exercise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart rate climbs, lactate builds, and muscle pain demands focus, pushing athletes toward an associative mindset where every pedal stroke is monitored. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratory work with treadmill runners shows that as &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28858053/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;rate of perceived exertion&lt;/a&gt; climbs from “somewhat hard” to “very hard,” seconds feel even longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surge in afferent signals may flood cortical networks that normally keep temporal information tidy, so the brain logs more sensory events per unit of real time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electrophysiological &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4830363/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; link this overload to elevated activity in supplementary motor areas, cerebellum, and ventral striatum, regions repeatedly flagged in timing meta‑analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because those circuits also help schedule movements, distorted timing could feed back into pacing errors, explaining why novice cyclists often start too hard and fade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-competition-exercise-and-time-perception"&gt;Competition, exercise, and time perception&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many coaches assume that racing a foe distracts athletes from discomfort, shortening perceived &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/time-may-not-just-move-forward-experts-say-it-could-rewind/"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cycling data upend that idea: even when volunteers tried to outsprint a rival and actually finished about 1  seconds quicker, their timing errors matched the solo run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More work has to be done to further unravel the role of external stimuli, exercise intensity, and duration on the perception of time during exercise,” wrote Edwards and colleagues, calling for studies that vary course length and sport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visual pacers such as &lt;a href="https://runningmagazine.ca/the-scene/is-wavelight-technology-good-for-the-sport/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Wavelight technology&lt;/a&gt; – a ring of LED lights that guides record attempts in track meets – may offer a stronger cue; analysts note that &lt;a href="https://worldathletics.org/athletes/uganda/joshua-cheptegei-14645612" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Joshua Cheptegei’s 10,000‑meter&lt;/a&gt; world record was set while chasing the moving lights, which kept every kilometer within 0.8 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet even lights cannot erase internal noise completely, so athletes must still learn to calibrate effort against split times displayed on the track or bike computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-have-we-learned"&gt;What have we learned?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing that exercise stretches moments can shape better pacing strategies. Endurance coaches often teach swimmers to rehearse key distances with a metronome or music track so the internal clock anchors to an external beat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyclists can glance at distance markers rather than &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/physicists-make-bold-claims-that-time-is-an-illusion-question-its-existence/"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;, because distance cues remain objective even when seconds feel elastic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For high‑intensity interval training, pre‑programmed timers remove guesswork, preventing premature burnout caused by overestimating rest breaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recreational exercisers may welcome the illusion, after all, a half‑hour ride that feels like forty minutes makes the gym session feel “worth it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-unanswered-questions-and-next-steps"&gt;Unanswered questions and next steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does the illusion scale with workout length, or plateau after the first surge of pain signals? Would elite athletes, who spend years refining &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1355442/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;interoceptive awareness&lt;/a&gt;, show smaller distortions, or merely learn to ignore them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain‑stimulation studies could temporarily mute motor cortex or cerebellum activity to test causal roles in the effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wearable neuroimaging, now light enough for treadmill use, might map the live interplay between stride cadence, pulse counts, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-explain-why-time-seems-to-fly-by-pass-faster-as-we-age-brain-perception/"&gt;subjective time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until then, the best takeaway is pragmatic: trust the stopwatch, not your feelings, when pacing the final lap or last hill climb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/brb3.3471" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brain and Behavior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 13:26:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPQldhSURvakdrajBwOVN4VTBSN1BKWUd4N1FldHpSQk40UUZDYzlPUnhNajJ2NTVpTk9sdnVkYTVJMkFEakpkNHZFS3ROQmFnSE1tblQzODNqQ3dVN09SVFhyMGNfRE4yVlNWSjhZVEhYZWpuUXZzbkdPQXFLS3dxbU82ZldEQkNnRy1adWUwMGlEZmRPMWtzb042VmRPQUxtQ0dXWVI3R28</guid></item><item><title>常见的蔬菜可能会抵消与肥胖相关的大脑变化- PsyPost | A common vegetable may counteract brain changes linked to obesity - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxNenVFOVBtc1lRZE5UelB2TzB5dDc2dEo1TjkwanROUUdncUtHRHZzN0pwblNRczF0T0J2X3NqQ3gyVXBaVkxBSHZYN0RmX0x0ZHZlcmFqZWE4UFpFZm5xdDZKb3JpZDluNHgweTNoMF9Lblp2SzM1Y0NYdlFqUkd5YVdjQmthZDhHa2UtcDhrVVZrbWpO?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006899325002008" target="_blank"&gt;Brain Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; suggests that adding okra to the diet can protect against long-term metabolic problems caused by early-life overfeeding. In a rat model, okra supplementation prevented obesity, high blood sugar, and brain inflammation associated with being overnourished during infancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okra, also known as &lt;em&gt;Abelmoschus esculentus&lt;/em&gt;, is a vegetable rich in antioxidants, fiber, and plant compounds believed to have anti-inflammatory and metabolic benefits. While it’s often consumed for its nutritional value, researchers are increasingly interested in its potential to reduce the risk of chronic diseases. The authors of this new study set out to test whether including okra in the diet could protect against metabolic disorders that begin during early development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rationale behind the study stems from concerns about early overnutrition, which has been linked to long-term health problems. When young animals or humans consume more calories than needed during critical periods of development, they can experience lasting changes to their metabolism, body composition, and brain signaling pathways involved in hunger and energy use. One known consequence of early overfeeding is the development of obesity and insulin resistance in adulthood. The researchers aimed to explore whether supplementing the diet with okra could prevent these outcomes by improving inflammation and restoring healthy energy balance in the brain and body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this idea, the researchers used a well-established model of early overfeeding in rats. Shortly after birth, some litters were reduced to just three pups per mother, ensuring that each infant rat had more access to milk and gained weight more rapidly. This small litter (SL) condition is known to simulate early overnutrition. A separate group of litters was maintained at the typical eight pups per mother, serving as the normal litter (NL) control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At three weeks of age, all rats were weaned and assigned to one of two diets: a standard rodent diet or the same diet supplemented with 1.5% okra. This produced four groups in total: normal-litter rats on a standard diet (NL-SD), normal-litter rats on the okra diet (NL-AE), small-litter rats on a standard diet (SL-SD), and small-litter rats on the okra diet (SL-AE). The animals continued on these diets until they reached adulthood at 100 days of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the study, the researchers tracked body weight, food and water consumption, blood sugar levels, fat accumulation, and muscle mass. They also measured insulin sensitivity both in the body and the brain, and examined levels of inflammation-related molecules in the hypothalamus, a brain region that regulates appetite and energy balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, the small-litter rats on the standard diet became obese and showed multiple signs of metabolic dysfunction. These rats ate more food, had higher blood sugar and fat levels, and gained more fat mass compared to their normal-litter peers. They also displayed impaired glucose tolerance and signs of insulin resistance. In addition, these animals had elevated levels of inflammatory molecules—such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1 beta—in the hypothalamus. These molecules are known to interfere with insulin signaling and promote weight gain and metabolic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rats that were overfed early in life but received the okra-supplemented diet showed a very different profile. Despite having the same early nutritional background, they avoided the rise in blood sugar, triglycerides, and cholesterol seen in their standard-fed counterparts. Their total fat mass was reduced, and their muscle mass improved. They also had better results on a glucose tolerance test, suggesting improved control of blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, their brains showed lower levels of inflammatory markers, and they responded to insulin administered directly into the brain—something the overfed rats on a standard diet could not do. This improvement in brain insulin sensitivity was linked to reduced food intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rats in the normal-litter groups, whether they received the okra diet or not, showed no significant differences in weight, fat, glucose, or inflammation, suggesting that okra did not produce major changes in healthy animals, but specifically helped those who were metabolically impaired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe that compounds found in okra—such as catechins, quercetin, and other phenolics—may help explain the observed benefits. These plant-based substances are known to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and previous research has suggested they can improve insulin signaling and reduce blood sugar levels. Although the exact mechanisms remain unclear, the results support the idea that functional foods like okra can influence long-term health when introduced early in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study adds to growing evidence that diet in early life has lasting consequences on health and that certain foods may offer protective effects. The findings are especially relevant given the increasing rates of childhood obesity worldwide and the difficulty of reversing its effects in adulthood. While this experiment was conducted in rats and may not directly translate to humans, it raises the possibility that early dietary interventions with plant-based compounds could help prevent or manage metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the authors acknowledge some limitations. They did not examine insulin production or hormone levels in the pancreas, which would have provided more information about how okra affects insulin regulation. They also did not study whether okra directly influences leptin signaling, another important regulator of energy balance. More research is needed to clarify how specific compounds in okra interact with metabolic pathways and whether similar effects can be observed in human populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the study provides evidence for the potential of okra as a dietary supplement to reduce the long-term harm of early overnutrition. By improving both peripheral and brain insulin sensitivity, reducing inflammation, and restoring healthier body composition, okra may serve as a useful component of non-drug strategies to combat obesity and its associated health risks. Future studies in humans will be needed to determine whether similar effects can be achieved and whether okra-based interventions could become part of broader public health approaches to improve lifelong metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2025.149641" target="_blank"&gt;Okra-supplemented diet prevents hypothalamic inflammation in early overfeeding-programmed obese rats&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Camila Luiza Rodrigues dos Santos Ricken, Ginislene Dias, Ingridys Regina Borkenhagen, Adriano Nicoli Roecker, Gisele Facholi Bomfim, Hercules de Oliveira Costermani, Aline Milena Dantas Rodrigues, Nathalia Macedo Sanches, Ester Vieira Alves, Ricardo de Oliveira, and Júlio Cezar de Oliveira.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 13:22:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxNenVFOVBtc1lRZE5UelB2TzB5dDc2dEo1TjkwanROUUdncUtHRHZzN0pwblNRczF0T0J2X3NqQ3gyVXBaVkxBSHZYN0RmX0x0ZHZlcmFqZWE4UFpFZm5xdDZKb3JpZDluNHgweTNoMF9Lblp2SzM1Y0NYdlFqUkd5YVdjQmthZDhHa2UtcDhrVVZrbWpO</guid></item><item><title>8种流行补充剂的危险副作用和风险- Verywell Health | Dangerous Side Effects and Risks of 8 Popular Supplements - Verywell Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxQaGpQclFSb0VoOXlRM2FnSTBFb2tDakY5LUVVVUxuWUE1NllDT0xOSjl5b01YWGFLNXA2VThsSnR3N2NweS1XMXZhUHI5aUZYWmdxSnhKZmNoaVo0T3RUYmlzclRDWHFndDlTX3RNWHJqdGNXRy1NbkwyR2lWdWZQcQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="health-sc-page_1-0" class="comp health-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content article-content expert-content right-rail__offset lock-journey" data-sc-sticky-offset="60" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[400, 1400, 1400, 1700, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; More than 50% of adults in the United States use dietary supplements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, supplements aren't regulated like medications, so it is essential to be aware of possible dangerous side effects to stay safe and healthy.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_75-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although rare, it is possible to overdose on iron supplements. Since 1997, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required that any iron supplements sold in doses higher than 30 mg contain strong warning labels and single-pill packaging.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

The compounds are also linked to decreased risks of dementia, depression, and hypertension.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="10339053" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the expert cautioned: "The key is moderation. Typically, that's one glass a day for women and two for men. More than that can have bad effects on brain health and may make you more likely to get dementia."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What evidence supports this?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers tracked the alcohol habits of 1,709 Copenhagen residents in the 1970s and reassessed them in the 1990s, when they were 65 or older. Over 20 years, 83 developed dementia, and their drinking patterns were compared to those who did not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the study is limited as eating habits and other lifestyle factors were not assessed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Editorial neurologist, John Brust, explained: "Research suggests that wine drinkers may have better dietary habits than beer and liquor drinkers. There is also evidence that dietary vitamin E may reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's. These factors were not accounted for in this study. Nonetheless, this is a provocative report providing evidence that there is indeed something specifically beneficial about wine."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Criticism&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, Dr Sara Imarisio, said: "Understanding the different factors that affect our dementia risk is vital for finding new ways to reduce the number of people who develop the condition in the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"While the researchers found that those eating a diet with high levels of flavonoids were less likely to report memory and thinking problems, we should treat these results with caution."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She added: "Dementia is caused by a complex mix of age, genetics and lifestyle factors. From this study alone, we are unable to untangle diet or a specific food component from other lifestyle factors which contribute to dementia risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Cornwall Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 12:59:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxPQlZ0R3htcHB6T2I4eWR6OS1DVGhUU0tWVjA0S3JlYlZXYXZzeVgyRTBoenhtV05iZVd5eWNXZWM3dWluQ3RSVVJqTldlTXRKRFF2TTZJY0Nid3JDMUZLb3FJM0lPZUEyaTBnZDNsU0tvVzlGY01BWU5PeUtFWXZFRUJTd1dCT2x5UGRKeFJidU1SOF85WXlIUA</guid></item></channel></rss>
