    Consult with your doctor before beginning any new fitness program.
&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmevvma4o000t28p1geng6fgh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When it comes to the discourse over longevity, the “bro scientists” are mostly leading the way.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s00053b6nvpfq0hla@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s according to longevity specialist Dr. Vonda Wright, whose new book, “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0593736583?tag=randohouseinc7986-20" target="_blank"&gt;Unbreakable:&lt;/a&gt;  A Woman’s Guide to Aging With Power,” aims to level the playing field.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s00063b6ny73l9946@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have a gamut of people framing men living longer as longevity and a very hopeful message,” said Wright, an orthopedic surgeon and author based in Orlando. That is a positive thing, but “for generations, when you think of women living longer, the solution is anti-aging, as if there’s something wrong with us. There’s nothing wrong with us. We are aging in a different way than men.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s00073b6n0xob90in@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Women do &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/13/health/life-expectancy-gender-gap"&gt;live longer than men&lt;/a&gt;, on average. But Wright is focusing not just on living longer but also living better. And in her book, she addresses female longevity from the perspectives of women. She notes the role that shifting hormones play in this process and encourages women to work on disease prevention  and strength building during their early midlife years — instead of waiting on good health to run out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s00083b6n6ov82pfb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those years — think 35 to 45&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;years old — can be used as a time to strengthen oneself rather than to succumb to the myth that one’s best days are in the past, she said. Wright calls it the “critical decade.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s00093b6n8y11wat1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I believe and have shown that with a daily investment in our mobility, in smart nutrition, in mobilizing our mindset,” Wright said, “we can live healthy, vital, active, joyful, unbreakable lives long into the foreseeable future.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000a3b6nkrq3d1rj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            CNN spoke with Wright about how women can work toward aging with power.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How can women change their mindset on aging?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Vonda Wright: &lt;/strong&gt;I spend a lot of time in the first part of my book asking women to identify what their values are — their “why” for making changes. I value independence — getting to do what I want when I want to do it. If I receive help, it’s because I want it, not because I need it. I value a clear brain. Once you know your values, you can form your goals. Many women don’t want to be a burden to their children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What are some important scientific findings on female aging, and how do they inform your advice?&lt;/strong&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wright:&lt;/strong&gt; There are estrogen receptors everywhere, from brain to muscle to bone. Without estrogen, nearly every organ system is affected, meaning the rate of aging increases. For instance, during &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/10/health/menopause-women-midlife-hormones-wellness"&gt;the perimenopause period&lt;/a&gt;, women can lose 15% to 20% of our bone density. That’s more rapid (than the bone density loss men  experience as they age). The brain starves without estrogen, and the lack can also increase inflammation and risk for cardiovascular disease. Making your hormone optimization decision &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/hormone-therapy-for-menopause" target="_blank"&gt;based on facts&lt;/a&gt;, not fear, is one of the first decisions I want women to make.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wright: &lt;/strong&gt;I’m going to give you some frameworks and practical tips. No. 1: We are not losing weight. We are recomposing, meaning it matters what we’re made of, because we’re trying to maximize lean muscle and minimize body fat — not to be skinny but to be lean.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000i3b6nikdmjwe1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No. 2: Women &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/26/health/eating-disorders-food-2023-wellness"&gt;deserve to eat&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve been taught for generations that we can only be little, and therefore we don’t eat. But you must eat to be healthy, so what do we eat? I’m a big proponent of 1 gram of protein per ideal pound a day, so that we support the muscle we’re trying to build.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000j3b6nqhst6t22@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But we have got to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/28/health/cutting-added-sugar-recommendations-wellness"&gt;stop eating so much sugar&lt;/a&gt; in this country, because it’s cooking us from the inside out. It contributes to multiple diseases caused by chronic, age-related inflammation. I’m not against carbs; I’m against simple carbs and sugar because of what they do to &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000941.htm" target="_blank"&gt;our glycemic index&lt;/a&gt;, which measures how quickly a food makes your blood sugar rise.

            &lt;strong&gt;Wright: &lt;/strong&gt;I prescribe exercise with the acronym “FACE” your future.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;The F is flexibility and joint range of motion&lt;/strong&gt;. Tendons, ligaments and muscles naturally shorten with time, which results in stiff joints and people being hunched over and shuffling around. Some great exercises for that are Pilates, yoga, tai chi and dynamic stretching.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000o3b6nn2u7jmkq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

I prescribe 80-20 aerobic activity, which means 80% of the time we are in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/26/health/talk-test-exercise-intensity-cdc-wellness"&gt;lower heart rate exercise&lt;/a&gt;, whether it’s walking or something else, and 20% of the time we are sprinting. This is modeled after what we do with pro athletes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;The C is “carry a load.”&lt;/strong&gt; Our goal is strength and power, so lifting heavy is very well detailed for hundreds of pages in this book. Basically, it means fewer reps, higher weights.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000q3b6n339t80ap@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Finally, E is equilibrium&lt;/strong&gt;, or balance, and foot speed. You may be strong and flexible, but if you trip and fall, you often have what’s called a fatal fall and break something that 50% of the time puts you in a nursing home.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wright: &lt;/strong&gt;That might start with &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/29/health/5-steps-habit-builder-wellness"&gt;creating a streak&lt;/a&gt;. For seven days in a row, you’re doing something that’s helpful to your body, such as walking every day after your biggest meal. Then you don’t want to stop because you’ve worked hard.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000u3b6nz1fa1gow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Also start a foundational or starting lifting program. I have one of those in my book, just to teach you how to move your body. It will take six or nine months to work up to heavy, but it’s not hard. Hiring a trainer to teach you is very helpful. I encourage people, as the holidays are coming up, don’t ask for a purse or some appliance. Ask for a trainer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Once you arrive there, that is what you should do for the rest of your life, because we’re trying to build strength and power, not necessarily endurance or bigger muscles.

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What are the best ways to build mental resilience?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wright: &lt;/strong&gt;The work that I cite in the book is built around &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/13/health/how-to-choose-therapist-wellness"&gt;building mental hardiness&lt;/a&gt;, and there are 10 hardiness factors. Interestingly, one of them is physical activity. The &lt;a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/13740661" target="_blank"&gt;research I looked at&lt;/a&gt;, by Dr. Paul Bartone and Dr. Steven Stein, was done on prisoners of war, current US Army Rangers and people with really tough congenital problems. One common characteristic of all those people is they had a physical activity practice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000y3b6nrqtthf2p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you learn to lift heavy, what happens physically is you get stronger. But every time you’re done lifting, your brain feels invincible. Another example is that I do Spartan Stadion obstacle course races in legendary stadiums, and I frequently invite women who follow me on social media to join me. They show up in all states of fitness — some not fit, some world-class athletes. When they finish doing hard physical things, their brain has also changed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmew0rd3s000z3b6nabhqagai@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s really important to realize that you are worth the daily investment in your health. Many times people, especially women, prioritize everything in the world in front of themselves. But the reality is, to do the work, we need to realize that we are worth the daily investment.

I plod down the stairs, gripping the rail to lighten my steps so as not to wake my two toddlers. The following 30-45 minutes of alone time are a treasured commodity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After letting the dog out and feeding him (because even with the kids asleep, I still have another creature’s needs to consider before my own), I settle into my desk chair with my coffee, water and toast. I glance at the calendar ― just two more weeks until my mom flies in town to help with the kids. Changing and lifting my 2.5-year-old and 15-month-old had begun to feel like an Olympic sport with the 40 pounds of extra weight I’d been carrying. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next to my calendar hangs the ultrasound photos from my most recent scan.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added: 'In one interview, a doctor said: “In patients with gastrointestinal tumors, a few months before the diagnosis, a strong craving for sweets appears. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'"People eat ice cream by the kilo, even though they never cared for desserts before.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The explanation is clear: tumor cells consume glucose faster than healthy ones, so the brain starts programming behavior to serve the disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The influencer also revealed a woman who was later diagnosed with kidney cancer, had claimed she could drink 'pickle brine straight from the jar and eat it with crackers'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another suddenly got 'hooked' on dairy products. Relatives thought it was just 'a phase' or 'new tastes'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'In reality, the body sends messages in advance—most just delete them without even opening,' they added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Limited research has also suggested that changes in food behaviour could be a pre-cursor to cancer diagnoses. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In one 2022 review, analysing seven studies on the topic, Italian researchers noted that 'food cravings have been found to be associated with breast cancer, lymphoma, and ovarian or endometrial cancer'. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But we don't have any way to manifest that,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A blood test will determine if patients are anemic, triggering further tests to determine the cause—one of which could be colon or colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other experts, however, have noted that further research is first vital and the notion, for example, that sugar should be avoided to prevent cancer growth is unfounded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no evidence to show that craving sugar is a symptom of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The alleged relationship between cancer and sugar is a long and complicated one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 11:46:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQdENTaTlpS09tVHNsNVRzaUlmZGtqVVRwVUwwZVBuWlZ6OFNJMHVvaUJVUnpacldxRFdEN1pYaHlhTGg5V19QdjgxY2NJTl9VbXUyU1VPLTBMcTRIR0ZWc24tdGtDaENxM0VmZUNyRUJCTlF5dHBQeFpvcEN3UGNWeTFEYU1ISXRjb3RfSVpucW9Ea3JjOFE3Q0hOb2hhb3E4MlFJemdCbHJFUdIBrwFBVV95cUxQV18yQ3JfTTl0Y3VlbnpnLV9BdURjRTktc2hYbS05WWlidlJKYXFRbmlQbVV6a3U3NHV3SFJPWnBCQ291Mmt4UGJkZkY3aFJURTVQcHBLSGZaR0RZdmlRckJ2NXVZSGgwSmRlVDZCampnNjNleXVHM0pkNFF4bWk0MTYtX21GTzBzYXFFd0JQQWQzRFlwbmxjNWJFaDhnYnlHSFVLb0szQ19mYWRxNXk4</guid></item><item><title>越来越多的人患有“化学恐惧症” —而MAHA是部分原因- HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/more-and-more-people-suffer-from-chemophobia-and-maha-is-partly-to-blame-goog_l_68af1b19e4b0bbcc3f8d48a5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever muttered to yourself, “I should really get the organic peaches,” or “I need to replace my old makeup with ‘clean’ beauty products” or “I really want to buy the “non-toxic’ laundry detergent,” you may have fallen into the chemophobia trap, an almost inescapable phobia that’s infiltrating lots of homes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HuffPost Life delivers practical, reliable advice to navigate life’s challenges and make informed decisions.

That goes for your body, your pets, your car, your TV, your home and the food you eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everything is just these structures of chemicals linked together into physical objects ... so, there’s zero reason to be afraid of chemicals broadly,” said Love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chemophobia was born from the ‘appeal to nature fallacy’ and a desire to ‘get back to ancestral living.’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemophobia was born from the “appeal to nature fallacy,” said Love, which is “the false belief that natural substances ... are inherently safe, beneficial or superior, whereas synthetic substances are inherently bad, dangerous, harmful or worse than a natural counterpart.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is nothing legitimate about this belief, she added. But both chemophobia and the appeal to nature fallacy are central to pseudoscience, the anti-vaccine movement and the MAHA wellness industry, Love noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the core of chemophobia and appeal to nature fallacy is also a “romanticization of ancestral living, when, in reality, we lived very poorly, we died very young and often suffering and in pain,” Love said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Going back to simpler times” are talking points for both MAHA and MAGA, which, of course, stands for “Make America Great Again,” a slogan that alludes to the past.

I’ve cut all fructose from my diet and I’m the healthiest I’ve ever been.’ Then a mom, wanting to do the best for her children says, ‘I need to cut out all fructose’ and not only removes the ultra-processed foods like sweetened beverages, but also says no to fruit in her household because of this misinformation,” Hardy said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has lots of consequences, including a lack of nutrition in the home (from missing out on the fiber and vitamins from fruit) and the encouragement of disordered eating in kids, who, from this elimination of fructose, will learn the false idea that “fruit is bad” or “fructose is bad,” explained Hardy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Illustration: HuffPost; Photos: Getty"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Illustration: HuffPost; Photos: Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Chemophobia makes products that claim to be "natural" or "clean" feel superior, even when that isn't the case.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our brains want clear, black-and-white information.

They want black and white,” said Hardy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;We make choices all day long, which makes categorizing things, like food, as “good or bad” appealing to our minds, Hardy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, everyone wants to make the “good” choice, Caulfield added. “We want to do what’s best for ourselves and for the environment and for our community and our family,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, we look for “clear signals of goodness,” or “short cuts to making the right decision,” added Caulfield. We turn not only to words like “good” or “bad,” but also “toxin-free,” “natural” and “clean,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing these words slapped on a jar of nut butter, on a shampoo bottle, or on sunscreen makes making the “right choice” easier, he added — “even though the evidence does not support what’s implied by those words, those ‘health halos,’” noted Caulfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;These words are an “oversimplification,” Hardy said. “People now leverage their social media presence to share those oversimplified nutrition messages, most of which are at best, wrong, at worst, harmful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chemophobia is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard to escape. It’s even built into marketing campaigns and product names.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever fallen into the chemophobia trap without knowing, you aren’t alone. It’s complicated and nuanced, and the science is, at times, messy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, chemophobia is the inspiration behind brand names and entire product categorizations; “clean beauty” is one huge example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fears of chemicals are now marketing ploys. “You’re going to find products that claim that they’re ‘chemical-free,’ and that doesn’t exist,” Love said, referring to the fact that, once again, everything is made up of chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market forces take over and cling to the chemophobia buzz words of the moment, whether that’s “clean” “gluten-free” or “non-GMO,” Caulfield said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, we have Triscuits labeled with non-GMO marketing, he said. We also have entire product lines at stores like Sephora that are categorized as “clean.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It creates this perception [of] ‘if that one’s chemical-free, then the alternative that isn’t labeled as such must be dangerous, must be bad,’” Love said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, making the “good” choice easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This isn’t to say there isn’t room for improvement in the health and food space.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I work in the public health space. I don’t know a single public health researcher, a single agricultural researcher, a single biomedical researcher who doesn’t want to make our food environment safer for everyone,” said Caulfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because Caulfield speaks out against chemophobia doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to make our food and health environment healthier, he stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I do think we should always be challenging both industry and government to do exactly that, but at the same time, we have to be realistic and understand the nature of the risks and the magnitude of risks at play,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both our food environment and agricultural practices could be safer, “but those moves should be based on what the science says, and not on slogans,” Caulfield said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporate greed and capitalism hinder these safety changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The huge irony here ... the answer to all of these chemophobia concerns ... it’s more government regulation.

That depends.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-landsverk-md/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Elizabeth Landsverk, " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68af1bbee4b0d635adb31f26" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-landsverk-md/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Elizabeth Landsverk, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;a geriatrician and dementia expert, tells HuffPost that the way alcohol impacts the body will vary based on your age. If your 2024 goals include plans to drink in moderation, here’s what she wants you to know.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How 1-2 Alcoholic Drinks Per Day Impact The Body In Your 20s, 30s And 40s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Your 20s, Landsverk says, are a resilient time for the body — which is probably why hangovers aren’t nearly as bad during that decade. “The liver and brain have the most resilience during that time,” she said. “The frontal lobes (reasoning, and judgment) are not quite developed. One is more likely to be open to drinking more or taking more risks, and this can set habits that will cause problems down the line.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You probably won’t notice a huge difference as you head into your 30s as long as you’re drinking moderately, but it’s important to keep your overall health in mind. “Ask yourself: How is your health otherwise? Obesity, which is epidemic in America, increases the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver,” Landsverk said. “Alcohol increases the risk of liver disease and scarring (cirrhosis). As a geriatrician, I would say a glass or two a week is fine. Some doctors say one drink a day is fine, but it is also neurotoxic and that can catch up with you.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In your 40s, more health risks begin to pop up, Landsverk explains. “Obesity, diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol all increase the risk for heart attacks, strokes and small stroke dementia,” she said. If you’re living with any of these conditions, even a small amount of alcohol can further increase your risk of events like heart attacks or strokes, so keep that in mind. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How 1-2 Alcoholic Drinks Impact The Body In Your 50s And 60s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once you hit your 50s, Landsverk says, even moderate drinking can wreak havoc on the body. “Alcohol, besides the vascular damage and dementia risks, increases the risk of breast cancer, esophageal cancer and liver cancer (after disease),” she said. Because cancer risk drastically increases as we age, adding any amount of alcohol into the mix will only further increase that risk. “Plus, as we age, good sleep is more elusive,” Landsverk added. “Substances like caffeine, cigarettes and alcohol all hinder sleep”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In your 60s, you’ll likely begin to feel the effects of moderate drinking on your body. “I can speak from experience: This is the age when tolerance may decrease dramatically,” Landsverk said. “I am healthy. I can ski or swim a mile, but a glass of wine makes me feel ill and slow the next day.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This, she says, is because older people are more likely to lose the enzyme to metabolize alcohol (alcohol dehydrogenase). “At this point, I can tolerate about one glass a week,” Landsverk noted. “If I had it daily, I would feel sick with just one glass a day. Older people have less reserve in the brain, liver and kidneys. The damage to the brain from even one glass a day is worse [when you’re over 60].”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Landsverk suggests that you think of alcoholic beverages like candy bars. “They’re nice with some meals, but they can increase your weight and blood sugar, and over decades adds to cancer risk and chronic illnesses that can lead to poor health.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

No, Landsverk emphasizes, and it’s important to remember to remember that other factors influence the impact alcohol has on your health and well-being, such as if you’re living with a disease like obesity or hypertension. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re older and in generally good health, you shouldn’t worry too much about the occasional alcoholic beverage.

There are roughly a dozen species of kissing bugs in the U.S. and four in California known to carry the parasite. Research has shown that in some places, such as Los Angeles' Griffith Park, about a third of all kissing bugs harbor the Chagas parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It's why a team of epidemiologists, researchers and medical doctors are calling on the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:to label the disease as endemic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;to label the disease as endemic&lt;/a&gt;, meaning consistently present, in the U.S. They hope that will bring awareness, education, dialogue and potentially public health investment to a disease that has long carried a stigma, falsely associated with poor, rural migrants from bug-infected homes in far-off tropical nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"This is a disease that has been neglected and has been impacting Latin Americans for many decades," said Norman Beatty, a medical epidemiologist at the University of Florida and an expert on Chagas. "But it's also here in the United States."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"We had a kid from the Hollywood Hills who got it," said Salvadore Hernandez, a cardiologist with Kaiser Permanente in Northern California. He said the patient had not traveled out of the country and probably got it in his leafy, affluent neighborhood, where kissing bugs are prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The parasite has also been detected in local wildlife, including wood rats, skunks and mice in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7906329/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Griffith Park;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Griffith Park&lt;/a&gt;, as well as bats, raccoons and black bears in other parts of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Kissing bugs are pretty equal opportunity when it comes to who they take a blood meal from," said Sarah Hamer, an epidemiologist at Texas A&amp;amp;M University's School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, listing off a variety of animals, such as ocelots, bobcats, coyotes, birds, reptiles and amphibians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"That means the reservoir for &lt;i&gt;T. cruzi &lt;/i&gt;is pretty large," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;California has the largest number of people in the U.S. infected with Chagas disease — between 70,000 and 100,000. That's mostly because the state is home to so many people from countries where the disease is endemic. But it's also because the parasite and vector live here, meaning some of those cases could be home-grown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0013036" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:small study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;small study&lt;/a&gt; by the state's Department of Public Health, for instance, found that 31 of 40 human cases reported to the state between 2013 and 2023 — about 78% — were acquired in other countries. For the remaining cases, health officials couldn't rule out local transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Chagas is not a reportable disease in California, which means the state does not require physicians and health systems to report and investigate it, as it does with influenza, Lyme and malaria. However, it is reportable in Los Angeles and San Diego counties; Los Angeles was the first county in the state to mandate reporting of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Between 2019 and 2023, health officials confirmed about 18 cases of Chagas disease in L.A. County, "although many more cases likely go undiagnosed," the department wrote in a statement. It said most of the identified cases were infected internationally, but some appear to be locally acquired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Gabriel Hamer, an entomologist at Texas A&amp;amp;M, said that confirmed human cases in the U.S. represent "just the tip of the iceberg" and that nobody really knows how many people actually have the disease. "There's no standardized reporting system. There's no active surveillance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most people find out they have the disease only after trying to donate blood, said Hamer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Janeice Smith, a retired teacher in Florida, discovered she had it in 2022 after receiving a letter from her local donation center telling her she'd tested positive and should go see a physician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Smith now runs &lt;a href="https://kissingbugalliance.org/janeices-story/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a nonprofit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a nonprofit&lt;/a&gt; to increase awareness of Chagas, which she said she probably got in 1966 when her family went to Mexico for vacation. She had returned home with a swollen eye and high fever, and was hospitalized for several weeks. No one found out what caused her symptoms until almost six decades later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hamer said proteins in the kissing bugs' saliva can cause acute reactions, such as swollen limbs, eyes and anaphylaxis, all unrelated to the disease-carrying parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But it's the longer-term or chronic effects that cause the most harm. And because the disease is not well known, and its symptoms are often indistinguishable from other forms of cardiac and organ damage, it's likely many people are showing up to their doctors' offices with heart arrhythmia, a swollen esophagus, seizures and stroke, without ever being screened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The disease is definitely underdiagnosed," said Hernandez, the Kaiser cardiologist. "If we screened for it and caught it early, most patients could be cured. The problem is we don't, and people end up dying or requiring terrifically expensive care," including organ transplants and surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Anti-parasitic medications can be used to stop disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Chagas is also prevalent in dogs who show similar clinical signs, heart failure or arrhythmias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"We'll see these acutely infected, usually young dogs that might be puppies, or dogs less than 1 or 2 years of age that are really adversely affected. And then we would have dogs that would come in older, and they might be in heart failure," said Ashley Saunders, a Texas A&amp;amp;M veterinary cardiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She said dogs often acquire the disease by eating the bugs, which give a much higher "dose" of the parasite than a few bug poops in a cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This story originally appeared in &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-09-01/chagas-disease-the-deadly-disease-youve-never-heard-of-but-is-here" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Los Angeles Times;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxNVDRNRmJyY1NTbzFKazRiV2wtdGY2ekJJTWE4eVdNMDA2YkhGWGViTjJ4SU9vLVlDQ1dySGtNUXgyZXkwRXBPNTVacDl2RE5tNVFoSWk4aV9Ueng1aFI1dlRKRDl6UGVxajBtRlBkRUFKVGNVTDBHSU04RVItUnVMdThFTG1ZaVZyblVYY3hYMA</guid></item><item><title>这是Lancaster General Health第一次清醒开颅手术的感受- LancasterOnline</title><link>https://lancasteronline.com/news/health/here-s-what-it-was-like-to-undergo-lancaster-general-health-s-first-awake-craniotomy/article_8e6d9598-97f0-44cc-b333-6e5638395af9.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody" class="asset-content  subscriber-premium" false&gt;

                                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The 2023 Thundering Pickle Turkey Trot wasn’t Tanner McIntosh’s first 5K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That Thanksgiving morning in York County, he expected to feel sore, raise some money for the Dillsburg Area Soccer Club and move on his with life. But McIntosh felt a searing pain in the lower right side of his back. He finished the race and chalked it up to soreness, getting older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;McIntosh, now 37 and living in Lancaster, didn’t consider that he could have a brain tumor. Before taking on his current job, he handled budgets for clinical trials on oncology, the study of tumors. The issue was familiar, not personal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;His friends didn’t consider it either, including Laura Hartnett of Philadelphia. She has known McIntosh for more than a decade, since they were counselors at The Renfrew Center, an eating disorder clinic in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I figured it was just time to rearrange his stretching routine,” Hartnett said by email. “I think I was too naïve to think that one of my friends (in their 30s at that) could be dealing with a major health scare.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That winter, McIntosh went skiing in Maine. The feeling returned, worse this time. His primary care doctor recommended physical therapy, which he tried without success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I don’t even know how to explain it,” McIntosh said. “It was just so overwhelming and so not normal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In spring 2024, he started to experience back spasms. They progressed to limit his ability to move and talk for up to 30 seconds. He could only form words with a lot of concentration. His doctor ordered a brain MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The result showed a mass next to his primary motor cortex, the part of his brain responsible for voluntary movements. It also meant McIntosh was eligible for a special procedure at Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health: the hospital’s first awake craniotomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;READ: &lt;a href="https://lancasteronline.com/news/local/lcbc-bus-crash-survivor-elizabethtown-native-pursues-a-medical-career-following-recovery/article_a2674670-8c99-11ef-8080-836e625d7f5e.html" target="_blank"&gt;LCBC bus crash survivor, Elizabethtown native pursues a medical career following recovery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;Awake craniotomies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Penn Medicine, which parents a dozen hospitals and medical centers in Pennsylvania, performs hundreds of awake craniotomies every year, typically with the goal of removing brain tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Most of the brain is actually pretty amenable to surgical intervention because it participates in part of a network,” said Dr. Eric Hintz, a neurosurgeon at LGH. He compared removing a piece of the brain to taking out a single power line in Lancaster city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But when tumors encroach on territory vital for talking, moving, seeing or other important bodily functions, surgeons may require an awake patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;During awake craniotomies, doctors begin the surgery with a patient on a local anesthetic and remove a section of the skull, commonly called a bone flap, to access the brain. As the procedure goes forward, they wake up the patient to test their ability to talk and move as they stimulate various parts of the brain. If a person can hold a conversation or perform certain movements, the professionals know they’re on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Hintz had performed awake craniotomies elsewhere but never in Lancaster County. That is, until McIntosh’s primary care doctor referred him to Hintz’ team in summer 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;READ: &lt;a href="https://lancasteronline.com/news/health/thrivers-breast-cancer-support-group-unites-lancaster-county-real-estate-agents/article_48280edc-7d27-11ef-b78e-f72cea196d4d.html" target="_blank"&gt;Thrivers breast cancer support group unites Lancaster County real estate agents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;‘A good candidate’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Not everyone fits the bill for an awake craniotomy, even if their tumor grows in a precarious location. McIntosh didn’t have this problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Kind of all aspects of Tanner made him a good candidate,” Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;McIntosh was young and relaxed, and stood to benefit from removing as much of the tumor as possible. Anesthesiologists, who protect the airway during surgery, can’t insert a tube in the patient’s throat as they normally do. Patients need to breathe on their own, which requires some level of physical fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Plus, the candidate needs to be comfortable with having a surgeon remove a section of their skull and prod around in their brain while conscious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“There are people who are so aggrieved at the idea that you can’t proceed,” Hintz said. He has had patients in the past decline the procedure for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;McIntosh, though, said he was willing. He had worked with Penn Medicine before, witnessing surgeries as a financial coordinator at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. He trusted the doctors. He didn’t want to wait for things to get worse, or for biopsy results to reveal that he might need surgery anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I didn’t have any hesitations about going through with the surgery, so ultimately, we just went with that,” McIntosh said. “Might as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Joey Fellenbaum, McIntosh’s partner, was present at the appointment at the Ann. B. Barshinger Cancer Institute when McIntosh’s care team pitched an awake craniotomy as an option. Even though McIntosh didn’t hesitate, Fellenbaum said he was in complete shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I have never heard of that being a possibility,” Fellenbaum said by email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To prepare, McIntosh met with Dr. Jesse Main, a neuropsychologist at LGH. When something goes wrong with the brain, Main helps patients understand how it may impact their behavior and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Main set expectations for McIntosh about what an operating room looks like and the types of things he might hear during surgery. They practiced the speech and motor exercises Hintz and Main could ask Tanner to do during surgery to check his brain function, including basic finger movements without contracting his fist. In other exercises, he acted like he was using a screwdriver, and flexed his arms and legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Meanwhile, Hintz prepared by studying McIntosh’s brain so he could go in with the best understanding of the tumor as possible. That knowledge was especially important because once Hintz started prodding around during surgery, he wouldn’t be able to rely on the untouched imagery he had from the scans. The brain, he said, isn’t color-coded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“A tumor itself looks very similar to the surrounding brain,” Hintz said. “It gets to that point that you’re relying on that clinical judgment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="tncms-inline-relcontent tncms-inline-relcontent-bio"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;PREPARING THE AWAKE CRANIOTOMY PROGRAM&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Lancaster General Health didn’t acquire the tools to perform awake craniotomies overnight. Dr. Jesse Main, a neuropsychologist on Tanner McIntosh’s care team, said awake craniotomies have been part of the interdisciplinary plan for LGH’s brain disease team for some time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Dr. Eric Hintz, the neurosurgeon at LGH who performed McIntosh’s surgery, had previously performed awake craniotomies, just not in Lancaster County. The surgery was “featured prominently” in his training, Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Penn Medicine’s doctors in Philadelphia perform awake craniotomies more often — one of Hintz’ colleagues averages one every two weeks, Hintz said — so the LGH team went to Philadelphia to receive training and watch their awake craniotomy program in real time. That included the anesthesia team, who would have to closely monitor their patients’ breathing since, unlike other surgeries, awake craniotomy patients can’t have a tube down their throat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Tanner’s surgery was the culmination of months of work and coordination between us and Philadelphia,” Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;On the day of McIntosh’s surgery, members of Penn Medicine’s neurosurgery team in Philadelphia traveled to Lancaster to help make sure the procedure went smoothly. Dr. Nduka M. Amankulor, the head of neurosurgical oncology for Penn Medicine and the Penn Brain Tumor Center’s director, came to participate, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;The surgery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;McIntosh doesn’t remember much from the surgery in December, even though he was awake for half of it. He recalls mostly sounds. It felt ethereal, he said, like a dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;McIntosh and his parents checked in at the hospital by 5:27 a.m. Laura McIntosh, his mother, said she felt a bit freaked out by the procedure, since she didn’t know anyone else who had undergone it. McIntosh is her first born of four and was “the easiest to raise,” she said by email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;LGH staff moved McIntosh to the operating room three hours later. He cracked jokes, met the anesthesiology team and learned more about the ideal outcome. He remembers it seeming like a normal, average day for staff. They administered local anesthesia, putting him in a stupor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;With McIntosh’s scalp anesthetized, Hintz placed his head in a clamp with three pins resting against his skull to keep McIntosh’s brain from moving. The neurosurgery team used computer software to align scans of the brain and tumor with McIntosh’s actual head. Then, Hintz and a neurosurgeon from Philadelphia drilled into the skull, which Hintz said is a “loud, stimulating experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Then McIntosh remembers waking up. He heard clicks, people talking, Hintz poking around. He described “sloshing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“It was pretty gnarly,” McIntosh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Main sat at McIntosh’s side, behind the curtain, to test the speech and motor skills they had worked on together. The tumor was on the left side of the brain, which impacts the right side of the body, so staff set up the operating room to allow Main to do his work from McIntosh’s right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Dr. Main, his voice is like a soft, velvety butter,” McIntosh said. “He just has this way of speaking, you couldn’t be stressed if you wanted to be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As Hintz stimulated the tissue around the tumor with electrical pulses, doctors called for McIntosh to carry out the exercises and checked in on him. McIntosh remembers touching his fingers together, holding Main’s hand and making a peace sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Because he saw the movie “Wicked” the weekend before, McIntosh said he tried to sing one of the songs during the surgery. He doesn’t remember which one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I think I was talking so much that they didn’t even have to do any of the speech prompts,” McIntosh said. “They were like, ‘His speech clearly is not affected.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Although Hintz had performed awake craniotomies before, he said it’s always a surreal experience. Unlike when a patient is completely unconscious, Hintz had to watch his words to ensure McIntosh understood and didn’t feel uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The surgery lasted under five hours. McIntosh remained awake for about half of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“And I remember at some point Dr. Main was like, ‘You’re doing a really good job, Tanner. You’re doing really good. This is going to be over before you know it,’” McIntosh said. “And then I was waking up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;READ: &lt;a href="https://lancasteronline.com/news/local/manheim-township-high-school-senior-overcomes-hearing-loss-to-excel-in-marching-band-q-a/article_b99edc2a-90b0-11ef-a992-cf91fe11c288.html" target="_blank"&gt;Manheim Township High School senior overcomes hearing loss to excel in marching band [Q&amp;amp;A] [video]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;What came (and comes) next&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;McIntosh spent only two nights in the hospital after the surgery (&lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/treatments/awake-craniotomy-brain-mapping"&gt;Penn Medicine’s website&lt;/a&gt; says patients usually stay for five to seven days). McIntosh said he was both happy and nervous to go home so quickly. He experienced a lot of pain during his first few weeks of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I had 24-hour nursing care,” he said, “and then it was just me and my mom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;His doctors initially suspected McIntosh had a grade two glioma, a slow-growing tumor that can progress over time, based on the tumor’s rate of growth between MRIs. A biopsy of the tumor post-surgery revealed a grade three astrocytoma, “a fast-growing brain tumor made up of astrocyte cells, which typically support and protect nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord,” according to a release from Penn Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Hintz was able to remove between 90% to 95% of his tumor, McIntosh said. Hintz said he was happy with the result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“It is always rewarding to open up those images and see the scan, and you did get the amount of tumor you were expecting to get out,” Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;McIntosh and his care team have a plan for dealing with the residual tumor and ensuring more cancer cells don’t return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;After some time recovering, McIntosh underwent 33 fractions of proton therapy — a noninvasive radiation treatment that uses “high-energy protons” rather than X-ray beams to destroy the DNA in cancer cells — over the course of 6 1/2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;After another short break, McIntosh started taking temozolomide, a chemotherapy medication he takes in the form of three capsules every morning. The cycles are four weeks long, with McIntosh taking the medication for five days straight before taking 23 days off. On his first day of chemotherapy, McIntosh returned to his full-time job as a clinical operations manager for ICON Strategic Solutions, a healthcare research and consulting firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;McIntosh will soon complete his sixth and final chemotherapy cycle. His back spasms, which turned out to be focal seizures, haven’t returned. He has made an effort to feel normal, even though he knows everyone is “dancing around the eggshells of cancer.” He has spent time with family and friends and kept everyone else aware of his goings-on with lighthearted social media posts (“Good news: I survived! Bad news: my head is still unusually and exceedingly large”). He has rooted for the Eagles, spent time with his golden retriever Cooper and visited Cape May, New Jersey, even though the heat of summer (usually his favorite) doesn’t help his nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In the meantime, McIntosh’s surgery has given the neurosurgery team at LGH a new tool. Hintz has already performed his second awake craniotomy at LGH on a woman with a high-grade glioma, a case in which the hospital didn’t have months to prepare. Time was of the essence, Hintz said. The surgery aimed to preserve speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“It’s nice to have available in the right instance,” Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Once McIntosh finishes his last cycle, another MRI will reveal whether the radiation and medication have done their job, McIntosh said. If they have, he will spend time recovering, figuring out how to find normal again. He will go in for more MRIs for the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“It doesn’t ever not suck,” McIntosh said. “But it does get better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="tncms-inline-relcontent tncms-inline-relcontent-bio"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;MEMENTOS FROM BRAIN SURGERY&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For any future patients in Lancaster General Health’s awake craniotomy program, take a lesson from Tanner McIntosh.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I asked them if I could keep my tumor,” McIntosh said. “They said no.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Despite growing the tumor himself (as McIntosh described), most hospitals across the country limit what you can take home, especially when it’s considered medical waste.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“There are a whole slew of regulations about what to do with biohazardous material, waste,” said Eric Hintz, a neurosurgeon at LGH. “Taking tissue home is absolutely verboten.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;While McIntosh got to see video of some parts of the surgery, Hintz also didn’t allow McIntosh to go home with footage showing his brain during surgery. Hintz said that’s due to concern that people could use video for “nefarious purposes,” including editing the surgery to look like medical malpractice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;McIntosh did get to take home the radiation mask he wore during his two months of proton therapy. Plus, he said the memories are his true souvenirs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Being able to retell the stories is a memento enough,” McIntosh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;div id="tncms-block-1010628" class="tncms-block invert-btn-primary"&gt;&lt;section id="block-1010628" class="block emphasis-h3   "&gt;&lt;div class=" card-bg-color"&gt;&lt;div class="card-panel panel"&gt;

The American research team, whose findings were published in the journal Neurology, say the study does not prove that acid reflux drugs cause dementia - it only shows an association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;The analyses involved participants from a community-based cohort from the time of enrolment (1987-1989) through 2017.

PPI use was examined two ways: current use at Visit 5 and duration of use prior to Visit 5 (Visit 1 to 2011, exposure categories: 0 days, 1 day-2.8 years, 2.8-4.4 years, &amp;gt;4.4 years). The outcome was incident dementia after Visit 5.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;The study included more than 5,700 people, age 45 and older, who did not have dementia at the start of the study. The participants had an average age of 75. The research team determined if the participants took acid reflux drugs by reviewing their medications during study visits and during yearly phone calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;Of the participants, 1,490 (26 per cent) had taken the drugs. They were then divided into four groups based on whether they had taken the drugs and for how long: people who didn’t take the drugs; those who took the drugs for up to 2.8 years; those who took them for 2.8 to 4.4 years; and people who took them for more than 4.4 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;“There were 585 cases of incident dementia over median follow-up time,” the authors stated.

Of the 4,222 people who did not take the drugs, 415 people developed dementia, or 19 cases per 1,000 person-years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;Scientists found that people who take proton pump inhibitors, or PPIs, for four-and-a-half years or more were 33 per cent more likely to develop the debilitating condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;Dr Lakshminarayan said: “More research is needed to confirm our findings and explore reasons for the possible link between long-term proton pump inhibitor use and a higher risk of dementia. While there are various ways to treat acid reflux, such as taking antacids, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding late meals and certain foods, different approaches may not work for everyone.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apples are a good source of fiber with 4 grams per apple, but there are many other fruits that provide even more fiber per serving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fiber found in fruit can provide both soluble and insoluble sources of fiber that can help support heart health, gut health and even reduce risk of cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fruits with more fiber than an apple include berries, tropical fruits and pears.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With a saying like “an apple a day keeps the doctor away,” this fruit is known to be one of the most nutritious to eat. Apples deliver a bunch of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/17769/5-health-benefits-of-an-apple/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, from heart protection to brain health, weight management and more.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One reason why they’re so good for you? Apples provide a good source of fiber, with 4 grams of fiber per medium-sized apple (200 g).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But apples aren’t the only &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-fiber-fruits-to-eat-11747635" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber-packed fruit&lt;/a&gt; around. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend consuming at least two servings of fruits each day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The ones you choose are up to you (and your taste preferences), but if you’re looking to up your daily fiber intake, we’ve compiled a list of nine fruits that have more fiber than an apple.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber is present in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and whole grains. The two kinds of fiber, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;soluble and insoluble&lt;/a&gt;, have their own characteristics. In the case of fruits, soluble fiber is found in fruits like oranges and apples, and this type of fiber absorbs water to slow digestion, helps &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-help-lower-cholesterol-8399539" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lower cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and may also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-for-high-blood-pressure-8769222" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;improve blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;. Insoluble fiber is present on the skin of fruits, like apple skin, and bulks up stool to improve regularity and lower the risk of colorectal cancer.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Passion fruit is a tropical fruit that resembles a plum filled with edible black seeds. Each seed is individually wrapped inside an orange-yellow pulp. This sweet-tart fruit claims our top spot of the highest fiber-containing fruit, boasting 24.5 g of fiber for every cup (236 g).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Enjoy it as a whole fruit, or spoon the seeds and pulp over some ricotta and drizzle with honey for an easy dessert.

Every cup (150 g) has almost 10 g of fiber, about one-third of your daily fiber need.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Use fresh raspberries in one of our&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8054514/healthy-breakfast-recipes-with-raspberries/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt; 18 Healthy Breakfast Recipes Featuring Raspberries&lt;/a&gt; or add frozen raspberries to&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/254618/raspberry-peach-mango-smoothie-bowl/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt; smoothie bowls&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/265712/muesli-with-raspberries/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt; muesli&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/258637/cocoa-chia-pudding-with-raspberries/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="6"&gt; chia pudding&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Guava has a crunch similar to a pear when raw. When ripe, some say the fruit has a flavor that is a mix between pear and strawberry, with a texture between an apple and a firm banana. What makes guava unique is both the rind and the seeds are edible, which contributes to the fruit’s fiber content of 9 g for every cup (165 g).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, it also ranks in our list of one of the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-protein-fruits-ranked-8628266" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;highest-protein fruits&lt;/a&gt;. You can eat it as whole fruit or cut it up into slices. Also, use the ripe fruit to make sauces, jams, jellies, cakes and pastries.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Similar to raspberries, blackberries are a delicate fruit but with a deep purple color and a sweeter flavor profile. Each cup (150 g) is filled with 8 g of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Blackberries are a portable and convenient snack, but they are also an excellent hero ingredient for desserts, especially for blackberry compote,&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7898208/blackberry-crisp/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; crisp&lt;/a&gt;, jam, and cake.

More importantly, half an avocado has about 7 g of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This green fruit adds instant creaminess to any dish—dips,&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7964485/avocado-chicken-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt; salads&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250881/avocado-tomato-chicken-sandwich/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt; sandwiches&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/avocado-toast-with-jammy-eggs-8648174" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt; toast&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7899506/avocado-banana-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt; smoothies&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7918897/creamy-avocado-pasta/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="6"&gt; pasta&lt;/a&gt;, to name a few.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Persimmon is a fall and winter fruit grown in tropical climates. Depending on the variety, this distinctively orange fruit resembles a tomato or a plum and the flavor can be sweet or astringent. Still, each fruit (168 g) has a whopping 6 g of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Their short season and limited availability make persimmons a rare gem during the colder months, where you can add them to our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7868597/bitter-greens-salad-with-persimmons-manchego-hazelnut-vinaigrette/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Bitter Greens Salad with Persimmons, Manchego &amp;amp; Hazelnut Vinaigrette&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Browsing the produce section, it’s hard to miss bright fuchsia or yellow-colored spiky dragon fruits. While their flavor profiles can vary depending on their variety, dragon fruits are seedy, juicy and pulpy. You can reap the 5.5 g of fiber per cup (180 g) by scooping the meaty and seedy flesh out of a halved dragon fruit, cutting the flesh into cubes and tossing it into smoothies or a fruit salad like our&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8023961/coconut-cream-fruit-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; Coconut Cream Fruit Salad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to apples versus pears, pears have more fiber than an apple with an average of 5.5 g per medium fruit.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Whether you choose an apple or a pear comes down to personal preference, availability and cost. Our favorite pairing for pear is tied between our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269123/arugula-salad-with-roasted-pork-tenderloin-pears-blue-cheese/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Arugula Salad with Roasted Pork Tenderloin, Pears &amp;amp; Blue Cheese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269137/roasted-pears-with-prosciutto/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Roasted Pears with Prosciutto&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Don’t underestimate this vibrant green, sweet and tangy fruit—1 cup of sliced kiwi (about 2 1/2 kiwi fruits) has 5.4 g of fiber (180 g).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Cut a&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/health-benefits-of-kiwi-8650515" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; kiwi&lt;/a&gt; fruit in half and scoop out the juicy and seedy flesh.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Green Bank Elementary-Middle School (pictured), nestled beside the world’s largest fully steerable radio telescope located at the Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia, has finally been granted access to Wi-Fi for the first time in its history&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Its isolation from the internet - and essentially the rest of the world - was enforced over 50 years ago to shield the groundbreaking scientific research taking place just next door (pictured: NSF Green Bank Telescope)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Because Wi-Fi signals use the same radio frequencies as the cosmic waves the telescope listens for, having active Wi-Fi nearby creates interference that drowns out the faint signals from space - making it impossible for scientists to do their work (pictured: scientists at Observatory)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Residents of Green Bank rely on landlines and face-to-face communication, with the surrounding mountains providing natural isolation from the outside world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who live in its secluded landscape often drive over an hour to reach a major grocery store - and even farther for a Walmart, the nearest of which is 50 miles away, turning each shopping trip into a 100-mile journey through rugged mountain terrain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was designed to serve as a home base for scientists from across the country, and the Observatory soon became the center of tightly enforced regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two designated 'quiet zones' were soon established, banning both Wi-Fi and cellphones use across vast stretches of surrounding land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the 'quiet zones' is the sprawling 13,000-square-mile National Radio Quiet Zone (NRQZ), which spans large portions of West Virginia and Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The other, far more restrictive, is the West Virginia Radio Astronomy Zone (WVRAZ), enforcing strict guidelines within a 10-mile radius of the Observatory itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Green Bank Elementary-Middle School was founded in part by the Observatory, which also donated land to house the school’s library and sits within the 10-mile zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But back then, nobody could have predicted a future where education would depend on invisible signals in the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;For the first time ever, the tiny school of just 100 students received long-awaited permission to connect to Wi-Fi and officially step into the modern age once and for all&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In 1956, the National Science Foundation’s National Radio Astronomy Observatory established the country’s first observatory (pictured) in the heart of the secluded community of Pocahontas County &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When these Quiet Zones were created in the late 1950s, by the Federal Communications Commission and the state of West Virginia, officials could not have predicted the technology using radio wavelengths that are almost an essential part of our daily lives,' Anthony Remijan, director of the NSF GBO, told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The area became even more tightly protected with the construction of the Robert C Byrd Green Bank Telescope between 1990 and 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its construction cemented the site as an enormous scientific marvel, towering 485 at feet tall with a 100-meter dish to become the largest fully steerable radio telescope on Earth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Built to study radio waves from deep space, the telescope played a crucial role in groundbreaking discoveries - including detecting low-frequency gravitational waves and unveiling other major astronomical phenomena. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But because Wi-Fi signals use the same radio frequencies as the cosmic waves the telescope listens for, having active Wi-Fi nearby creates interference that drowns out the faint signals from space - making it impossible for scientists to do their work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its critical role led the WVRAZ to ban devices that emit signals - like Wi-Fi routers - within the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Green Bank quickly became one of the few places on Earth where people weren’t constantly connected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It evolved into a Mecca for people tired of the modern world and ‘electrosensitive’ individuals who believe they suffer symptoms caused by internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since then, the NSF GBT telescope has continued to operate around the clock, scanning the skies 24 hours a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Two designated 'quiet zones' were soon established around the Observatory, one of which being the West Virginia Radio Astronomy Zone (WVRAZ), which banned Wi-Fi and cellphones within a 10-mile radius (pictured) of the observatory itself - Green Bank included&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Observatory engineers and experts concluded that the best compromise - for the benefit of the local community - was to officially permit limited use of 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, since the band was already compromised by some unregulated signals in the area (pictured: telescope operator in control room)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Regarding the decision, Principal Melissa Jordan (pictured) said: 'This conversation has been going on for a few years, and it’s finally happening. Our students now have the same equal opportunities as the others in the county'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet over time, engineers, scientists, town officials and residents alike came to recognize the need to catch up with the rest of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Today, we’re trying to balance our scientific operations with the reality of a world with Wi-Fi,' Remijan told the Green Bank Observatory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For years, scientists have struggled against Wi-Fi signals operating at 2.4 GHz - the very same frequency they rely on to detect the faint whispers of the universe, as it's the most common and affordable band used by everyday routers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Many people who were doing the right thing by not using Wi-Fi were left without access, while others who were illegally using routers did whatever they wanted,' Remijan explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Observatory engineers and experts concluded that the best compromise - for the benefit of the local community - was to officially permit limited use of 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, since the band was already compromised by some unregulated signals in the area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now, the that benefits everyone and helps us better manage the situation,' Remijan added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The decision has been welcomed by West Virginia officials, including Senator Shelley Moore Capito, who praised the Wi-Fi access as 'a gift of education, inspiration, and knowledge.'   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Enabling the students this tool to expand their universe is a fitting thing to receive from the Green Bank Observatory,' Senator Capito told Green Bank Observatory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Those who live in Green Bank (school pictured) often drive over an hour to reach a major grocery store - and even farther for a Walmart, the nearest of which is 50 miles away, turning each shopping trip into a 100-mile journey through rugged mountain terrain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

'I hope the students are excited to have the tools to help them become the scientists and explorers of tomorrow.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Assistant Principal Chloe Shaffner also expressed her support, praising the Observatory as a strong partner that has opened up new experiences for students. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Being so close to the Observatory, we’ve had a good partnership that’s brought new opportunities for our students, from field trips, to student contact with the International Space Station, and student science with weather balloons,' Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We have a good partnership, and it’s great that it’s led to this change.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Principal Melissa Jordan, Assistant Principal Chloe Shaffner and Dr. Leatha Williams -  the new superintendent of Pocahontas County Schools - did not immediately respond to Daily Mail for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 03:59:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Omega-3水平可以帮助解释女性患阿尔茨海默氏症的风险- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/levels-of-omega-3-could-help-explain-womens-alzheimers-risk</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;There's something about the female brain that makes it &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-is-more-common-in-women-and-this-may-help-explain-why"&gt;more susceptible&lt;/a&gt; to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="172408" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests that 'healthy', unsaturated fats, like omega-3, may partly explain that discrepancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to men, women typically have higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids, but in the current analysis, women with Alzheimer's showed a surprising dearth in these lipid molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-mysterious-molecule-is-crucial-to-brain-health-and-we-may-finally-know-why"&gt;This Mysterious Molecule Is Crucial to Brain Health, And We May Finally Know Why&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers did not find the same lipid changes in men with Alzheimer's compared to men without Alzheimer's, indicating that these fats may affect the disease differently based on sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings contribute to an overlooked hypothesis that has been around for decades, implicating &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprise-result-shows-mysterious-alzheimers-signal-may-protect-brain"&gt;fat droplets&lt;/a&gt; in Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, these lipids have been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-hidden-cause-of-alzheimers-may-have-been-identified-a-century-ago"&gt;overshadowed by tau tangles and amyloid plaques&lt;/a&gt;; however, they, too, are hallmarks of the disease within the brain, indicating that fatty acid metabolism has somehow gone awry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent Lancet Commission for Dementia &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(24)01296-0"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that 7 percent of Alzheimer's risk is attributed to low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/23229-lipoprotein"&gt;carries cholesterol and fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; around the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This risk factor may explain why women develop Alzheimer's at twice the rate of men, according to the current study, led by researchers at King's College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team looked at the lipid libraries of 841 participants across six European countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to those with sound cognitive health or mild cognitive impairment, those participants with Alzheimer's disease showed significantly higher levels of 'unhealthy' saturated fatty acids, and significantly lower levels of healthy unsaturated fatty acids, like omega-3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study suggests that women should make sure they are getting omega fatty acids in their diet – through fatty fish or via supplements," &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/omega-3s-could-protect-women-against-alzheimers"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; pharmaceutical scientist Cristina Legido-Quigley from King's College.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, we need  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="172408" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; to determine if shifting the lipid composition can influence the biological trajectory of Alzheimer's Disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172415" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172415" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/alz70512-gra-0001-m-642x819.jpg" alt="Omega-3 AD" class="size-medium wp-image-172415" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/alz70512-gra-0001-m-642x819.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/alz70512-gra-0001-m-325x415.jpg 325w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/alz70512-gra-0001-m-768x980.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/alz70512-gra-0001-m-600x766.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/alz70512-gra-0001-m.jpg 803w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172415" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Infographic showing the steps of the study.

In women, multiple lipids were associated with Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment. However, the same patterns were not observed in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to healthy women, women with Alzheimer's showed a decrease in lipoproteins with attached omega fatty acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While this study shows that women with Alzheimer's had lower levels of some unsaturated fats compared with men, further work is needed," &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/omega-3s-could-protect-women-against-alzheimers"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Julia Dudley, Head of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This includes understanding the mechanisms behind this difference and finding out if lifestyle changes, including diet, could have a role."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, there has been an &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/grave-consequences-scientists-warn-of-extreme-bias-in-brain-aging-research"&gt;extreme bias&lt;/a&gt; in brain aging research. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29903-3"&gt;only 5 percent of published studies&lt;/a&gt; in the field of neuroscience or psychiatry analyzed the influence of sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, many drug trials for Alzheimer's still do not &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/men-and-women-may-respond-differently-to-latest-alzheimers-drugs"&gt;analyze sex differences&lt;/a&gt;, even when they appear significant on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is that scientists don't know why women are more likely to develop Alzheimer's, or what to do about it. While women tend to live to an older age, even older men are less likely to develop this type of dementia than women of the same age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Understanding how the disease works differently in women could help doctors tailor future treatments and health advice," &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/omega-3s-could-protect-women-against-alzheimers"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Dudley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At last, that research is coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70512"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70512"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/356/bmj.i6583"&gt;review of evidence&lt;/a&gt; found that vitamin D supplements can cut respiratory infections, especially in people who are deficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early research even suggests it might help prevent autoimmune diseases like &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27644953/"&gt;rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27510600/"&gt;lupus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568997212001310"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, though more trials are needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10522-025-10237-8"&gt;inflammation damages telomeres&lt;/a&gt;, vitamin D's anti-inflammatory effects could explain its protective role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172639" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172639" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ElderlyWomanLiftingWeightsWithPhysio.jpg" alt="Elderly Woman Lifting Weights With Physio Guidance " class="size-full wp-image-172639" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ElderlyWomanLiftingWeightsWithPhysio.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ElderlyWomanLiftingWeightsWithPhysio-600x318.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172639" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;It is well known that vitamin D is essential for bone health. (jeffbergen/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this recent study, from Augusta University in the US, the researchers followed 1,031 people with an average age of 65 for five years, measuring their telomeres at the start, after two years, and after four years. Half took 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily, while the other half received a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="172635" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that telomeres were preserved by 140 base pairs in the vitamin D group, compared with a placebo. To put this in context, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19666704/"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; found that telomeres naturally shorten by about 460 base pairs over a decade, suggesting vitamin D's protective effect could be genuinely meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't the first promising finding. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21986705/;%20https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33164936/"&gt;Earlier studies&lt;/a&gt; have reported similar benefits, while the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6316700/#:%7E:text=3.1.-,Consumption%20of%20Specific%20Foods,28,33,34%5D."&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; – rich in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25131600/"&gt;anti-inflammatory nutrients&lt;/a&gt; – has also been linked to longer telomeres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The catch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are some important points to note. Some researchers warn that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6715353/"&gt;extremely long telomeres&lt;/a&gt; might actually increase &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2300503"&gt;disease risk&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting there's a sweet spot we don't yet understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also no agreement on the right dose. The Augusta researchers used 2,000 IU daily – much higher than the current recommended intake of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7019735/"&gt;600 IU&lt;/a&gt; for under-70s and 800 IU for older adults. Yet other research suggests just &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5949172/"&gt;400 IU&lt;/a&gt; might help prevent colds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-021-00593-z"&gt;optimal dose&lt;/a&gt; probably depends on individual factors, including existing vitamin D levels, overall nutrition and how the vitamin interacts with other nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although these findings are exciting, it's too early to start popping high-dose vitamin D in the hope of slowing aging. The strongest evidence for healthy aging still points to the basics: a balanced diet, regular exercise, quality sleep, not smoking and managing stress, all of which naturally support telomere health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if you're deficient in vitamin D or at risk of poor bone health, supplements remain a sensible choice backed by decades of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As scientists continue unravelling the mysteries of aging, vitamin D's role in keeping our cellular clocks ticking may prove to be just one piece of a much larger puzzle.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263680/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been sick with COVID this past week, missing the first classes of the fall semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was exposed by a cancer patient who finished a second round of chemotherapy earlier this month. They weren’t vaccinated within the last year because they were undergoing chemo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were exposed after Saturday evening mass at their Catholic church in Florida, where others around them were likely not vaccinated, and definitely unmasked, unlike the cancer patient. A dementia patient who refused to mask was the vector between the congregation and the cancer patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cancer patient is still recovering and now at about 90% of their capacity. They’re moving very slowly, thinking just as slowly. They can’t be left alone because they don’t have the reaction time they used to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m about 95% recovered, still have some sinus congestion and lingering crud in my chest. My ribs and my throat feel still feel bruised from hacking up my lungs so hard earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I’m not certain I’ll recover from is the trauma of having to check my father the cancer patient for a pulse last week when he collapsed on the kitchen floor, reviving him, getting him up and moving and into my car so I could rush him from their remote home to an urgent care facility more than 30 minutes away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t think to put a mask on him or a mask on myself at the time because I was worried something had gone very wrong after my dad’s two-year fight with cancer. I was worried about the monsoon-like storm I had to drive through to get to urgent care. I thought erroneously he had recovered from COVID and wasn’t contagious because he hadn’t had a fever and he hadn’t been coughing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I unintentionally hot boxed my dad’s COVID-laden exhalations in my car for 30 minutes trying to save my father. I’d do it again if it came down to it but I should never have had to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This country has been deeply damaged enough by the anti-vaccine movement since the COVID pandemic began; it shouldn’t have to face worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~ ~ ~&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now you’ve read &lt;a href="https://www.emptywheel.net/2025/08/28/cdc-shooting-2-0-its-coming-from-inside-the-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"&gt;Peterr’s Thursday post&lt;/a&gt; about the government’s internecine warfare at the Centers for Disease Control and the excision of director Susan Monarez, followed by the protest resignations of senior CDC staff in support of Monarez. The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/28/cdc-leaders-quit-susan-monarez-firing" target="_blank" rel="noopener external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"&gt;senior staff who resigned&lt;/a&gt; are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Demetre Daskalakis, former director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases&lt;br&gt;
• Debra Houry, former chief medical officer and deputy director for program and science&lt;br&gt;
• Daniel Jernigan, former director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases&lt;br&gt;
• Jennifer Layden, former director of office of public health data, science, technology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these individuals has a deep background and education in medicine, healthcare, or public health. None of then should have been expected compromise themselves to support our nation’s public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of them should have been treated so shabbily by RFK Jr.’s shit-tastic management of HHS. It’s not at all hyperbole to call it shit-tastic; I strongly recommend listening to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/29/podcasts/the-daily/cdc-vaccine-daskalakis.html?" target="_blank" rel="noopener external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"&gt;The New York Times’ podcast interview with Demetre Daskalakis&lt;/a&gt; because it will rid you of any doubt the label is deserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an excerpt I found particularly telling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: Yeah. So this was not related to ACIP, the announcement by the Secretary to change the childhood schedule. I learned about the change of the childhood schedule on X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABRAMS: You learned about it on social media —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: Yes, ma’am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABRAMS: — like the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: That is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABRAMS: Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: So I was sitting in a meeting with senior leaders at CDC. And as I was sitting there talking about the outbreaks that I was managing, my phone blew up with, “I didn’t know you guys were changing the children’s schedule.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABRAMS: People texting you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABRAMS: Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: Not from HHS, people in the world. Because they saw —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABRAMS: People in the world, your friends and family or whoever seeing this and being like, this doesn’t sound like you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: Correct. So we then asked the question, what’s going on? Can we see some kind of documentation? Because they were like, implement the change. But we’ve never seen anything in writing, so we asked if we could see the supporting data that led to the decision. And we were told no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABRAMS: Just flat out no?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: Flat out no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABRAMS: But can I ask you, did you ever actually have a conversation with Kennedy about any of this or any of his senior staffers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABRAMS: Or is it just that —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABRAMS: No communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABRAMS: Did you ever try?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABRAMS: And what would happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: So we offered to do briefings when he first started. I think some people were able to brief some lower level staff, but not staff that were Secretary Kennedy’s staff. So no one from my center has ever briefed the Secretary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABRAMS: On anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: Correct, on anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABRAMS: So basically, don’t have a line into RFK, and he’s not seeking out your advice or the advice of people who are theoretically supposed to advise him on things like this. How did you feel about that at the time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DASKALAKIS: I felt that this was highly atypical, that we weren’t able to share our expertise up the chain to be able to provide information that could be meaningful and thought process. And so what I kept thinking was, we’re not doing this, but there sure is a point of view up there. I wonder who’s doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My job is to make sure that we’re giving good science so people can make good decisions. And if I can’t make sure that science is untouched by non-scientific influence, I cannot say that I’m doing my job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that CDC science is going to be compromised by HHS. And if that science becomes biased, if it gets unduly influenced, then I can’t have my name on that science as something that I think should be used to make important decisions for people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I strongly recommend &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/29/podcasts/the-daily/cdc-vaccine-daskalakis.html?" target="_blank" rel="noopener external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"&gt;listening to this podcast&lt;/a&gt;. The other disturbing facet is the way in which Abrams just plows on; it could be an artifact of editing, but it could be another of the many ways in which media has not paused and shouted at the public how disturbing and inappropriate are RFK Jr.’s and Trump’s management of public health, in a misguided effort to remain neutral about a subject which isn’t and can’t be neutral at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can a US media outlet be neutral in the face of what looks increasingly like an occupation of government agencies by hostile forces? In the case of the CDC under RFK Jr.’s HHS, it’s damaging the administration of vaccinations to the entire country while undermining the nation’s ability to respond to pandemic and bioterrorism, not to mention its ability to safely provide basic healthcare. No one will be unaffected; no one can be neutral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~ ~ ~&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not kidding when I say our healthcare is now utterly compromised. Our first responders and healthcare providers can’t be assured of necessary vaccinations.

&lt;p&gt;This is absolute bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(For the record, my autoimmune disorder which has cost me lung capacity, is not on this list. I am not eligible for another COVID shot until I turn 65.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a recipe for disaster. Not only are &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/08/24/rural-america-braces-for-hospital-closures-after-medicaid-cuts/85723643007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"&gt;rural hospitals at risk because of cuts to Medicare under Trump’s Big Fugly Bill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; hospitals are at risk if their staff can’t be vaccinated readily in the face of a new COVID wave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If my father were to become sick again and collapse like he did, could he be assured there would be healthcare personnel ready to receive and treat him? Or might the healthcare system be overwhelmed and triage him to the very end of the line?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same goes for any of the rest of us, really. How can anyone in the US be assured the healthcare system will be able to respond if RFK Jr. is allowed to continue to hack away at it without supporting data, without support by seasoned, qualified professionals, without adequate oversight by Congress?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~ ~ ~&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the many things that raced through my mind as I tried to revive my dad was the thought we had not talked about DNR status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty sure my dad and mom have both indicated on healthcare POAs they are DNR under certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens, though, when one of them collapses at home? Should I have left him on the floor while ensuring his comfort?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously I didn’t do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a little over a week later I can’t help wonder if RFK Jr. has now forced DNR on swaths of Americans, and we’re already DNR where we are in our own homes whether we realize it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our healthcare system collapses because of his anti-vaccine and anti-healthcare regime, is he not assuring our healthcare system cannot resuscitate many of us?&lt;/p&gt;

In 2020, over 1.9 million new cases of colorectal cancer were recorded, and 930,000 people died globally, according to the World Health Organization (&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;). Though this disease was predominantly found in older individuals (aged 50 and above), a recent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjs/article/112/7/znaf102/8191209?login=false" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that people born in 1990 have twice the risk of developing colon cancer, compared to those born in 1950. Early diagnosis and intervention is crucial for treatment outcomes and survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Saurabh Sethi, a board-certified Gastroenterologist based in California and trained at Stanford and Harvard, has now spoken about some of the warning signs of colon cancer that are ignored. “Most colon cancers start silently,” the doctor says, emphasizing that if caught early, the 5-year survival rate is 90%. Let’s take a look at those symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Cancer is curable if detected early: Signs to pay attention to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Blood in the stool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noticing blood in your stool is a potential red flag. You may find the stool bright red or dark and tarry, which can be a signal of bleeding in the colon, according to Dr. Sethi. Many may dismiss this as hemorrhoids, but the doctor warns against it. Though hemorrhoids are common, persistent or recurring blood in stool warrants a doctor’s visit to rule out any serious conditions like colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Persistent bowel changes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unexplained changes in bowel habits lasting more than a few days are a cause of concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sethi explains that constipation, diarrhea, or narrowing of stools that lasts more than a few days is a red flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Abdominal pain or cramping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another common symptom of colon cancer is frequent bloating, cramps, or abdominal pain. These signs can often get dismissed or overlooked for less serious diseases. Dr. Sethi says that such signs, if new or unexplained, deserve a check-up by a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Unexplained weight loss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight loss that cannot be explained should not be dismissed. It is always a red flag. “Losing weight without dieting or lifestyle changes could mean your gut isn't absorbing nutrients properly,” Dr. Sethi explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Ongoing fatigue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling tired all the time, even after proper rest, is a cause of concern. This could be a crucial sign of colon cancer. “Chronic tiredness, weakness, or dizziness may result from slow blood loss and anemia,” Dr. Sethi says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Unexplained iron-deficiency anemia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, that’s right. Low iron could be a warning sign. “If labs show low iron, especially in men or post-menopausal women, it can be an early hidden sign,” Dr. Sethi adds. In such cases, it is important to talk to your doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Feeling of incomplete emptying&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you feel like your bowel is not emptying properly? This sign could mean more than just digestive problems. “If it feels like you “can't finish" after a bowel movement, it may point to blockage or tumor growth,” Dr. Sethi alerts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Family history&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A family history of colon cancer significantly increases your risk. In such cases, if the symptoms mentioned above appear, they should not be dismissed. “Don't delay screening if symptoms appear,” the doctor warns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Don't wait if you notice symptoms. Get screened. Colonoscopy saves lives,” Dr. Sethi says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAJBVV95cUxQZ0dZQ04tVmF0SnVCXzdOT3ZGU042aDdUeUNFQ01BQUkzZjBqbDFXaG1qNFNYVENONjhwZ3FjQlVRdTgwckQySDYxd3RnN2FjaldkSWNYMGcxeFd1dHVRX2RzN2R4ZVBmcWx5bzZkbXNaS1RRTVhXRWxwaFp3cUxoS1d5b0hhOXZaZTNXZVViQ1kxOVBkLWNWVUpBM2lHc3JvNnQwekZGczZsX25samJqWk5RcFZJVVhRZS0wWTZaOGN3TncyNFF5WTJJSnF1aGJWR0hSeThoUk9NQ0drSGJVUVVRa0dVVk1xYkNfaE84UzZ4OER3alg4TEp4VUZSQXFWdDBoNjZMQjJGcEVKd2t0ajlfUXI1Yjd5N01SUA</guid></item><item><title>甜菜汁通过改变老年人的口腔微生物组来降低老年人的血压-好消息网络</title><link>https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/beet-juice-lowers-blood-pressure-in-older-people-by-changing-their-oral-microbiome/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blood pressure lowering effect of nitrate-rich beetroot juice in older people may be due to specific changes in their oral microbiome, according to the largest study of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Exeter in England conducted &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891584925008068" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the study which was published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Free Radical Biology and Medicine. It followed &lt;a href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/beetroot-juice-may-promote-health-aging-exeter-university/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; that had shown a high nitrate diet can reduce blood pressure—which, in turn, can reduce the risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrate is crucial to the body and is consumed as a natural part of a vegetable-rich diet. When older adults drank a concentrated ‘shot’ of beetroot juice twice a day for two weeks, their blood pressure decreased – an effect not seen in a younger group used for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Encouraging older adults to consume more nitrate-rich vegetables could have significant long term health benefits,” &lt;a href="https://news.exeter.ac.uk/faculty-of-health-and-life-sciences/beetroot-juice-lowers-blood-pressure-in-older-people-by-changing-oral-microbiome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said study author&lt;/a&gt; Professor Anni Vanhatalo, of the University of Exeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know that a nitrate-rich diet has health benefits, and older people produce less of their own nitric oxide as they age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The good news is that if you don’t like beetroot, there are many nitrate-rich alternatives like spinach, rocket, fennel, celery and kale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AGING TIP:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a title="Popping a Daily Multivitamin Could Prevent Cognitive Decline as we Age, Shows Third Study" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/daily-multivitamin-could-prevent-cognitive-decline-as-we-age-shows-3rd-study/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Popping a Daily Multivitamin Could Prevent Cognitive Decline as we Age, Shows Third Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study recruited 39 adults under age 30 and 36 adults in their 60s and 70s (through the NIHR Exeter Clinical Research Facility).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both groups, the make-up of the oral microbiome changed significantly after drinking the nitrate-rich beetroot juice, but these changes differed between the younger and older age groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Exeter News, “The new study provides evidence that this outcome was likely caused by the suppression of potentially harmful bacteria in the mouth. An imbalance between beneficial and harmful oral bacteria can decrease the conversion of nitrate (abundant in vegetable-rich diets) to nitric oxide—which is key to healthy functioning of the blood vessels, and therefore the regulation of blood pressure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The older age group experienced a notable decrease in the mouth bacteria Prevotella after drinking the juice, along with an increase in the growth of bacteria known to benefit health, such as Neisseria. The older group had higher average blood pressure at the start of the study, which fell after taking the nitrate-rich beetroot juice, but not after taking the placebo supplement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This study shows that nitrate-rich foods alter the oral microbiome in a way that could result in less inflammation, as well as a lowering of blood pressure in older people,” said co-author Professor Andy Jones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This paves the way for larger studies to explore the influence of lifestyle factors and biological sex in how people respond to dietary nitrate supplementation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By uncovering how dietary nitrate affects oral bacteria and blood pressure in older adults, the study opens up new opportunities for improving vascular health through nutrition,” said Dr. Lee Beniston from BBSRC, which funded the research.&lt;/p&gt;

is characterized by the degeneration and shrinking of the front and sides of the brain, which then results in behavioral and personality changes—and like in Willis’s case, affects memory, one’s ability to think, and speak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eating is another aspect of the patient’s life affected by the illness. One example is the so-called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Banana Lady &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;examined by the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt; International School of Advanced

This breeds a “learnt resignation”, Wright says. But she says that if we prioritise mobility, muscle-building, flexibility and hormonal health, it doesn’t have to be that way — and she’s determined it won’t be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;We don’t always help ourselves. Wright sees&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; many “underfed, under-proteined” women. They say, “‘I drink my coffee in the morning, I’ll have a salad at lunch, I may not eat till 2 or 3,’” she tells me, speaking from her clinic in Orlando, Florida. “Our body needs a lot of protein to build muscle. Women have been taught our whole lives, in my generation, to be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; big” — Wright pinches thumb and forefinger together — “and the fact is, you have to feed yourself to age well and not to become frail.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Wright, 58, is impressive. She’s founding director of the Performance and Research Initiative for Masters Athletes, a longevity specialist and recently gave evidence to America’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as part of an expert panel on menopause and HRT. She looks robust and fabulous, with jet-black hair, manicured nails. In her new book, &lt;i&gt;Unbreakable: A Woman’s Guide to Ageing With Power&lt;/i&gt;, she talks of regaining her “badassery”.

Her brain was foggy. Her body hurt. She was weaker. “I had back fat hanging out of my bra.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Well, no longer. Wright has rebuilt herself and so can we all. &lt;i&gt;Unbreakable&lt;/i&gt; is a galvanising, meticulously detailed, science-based call to arms — powerful arms — for all women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Keep moving to shield against the “time bombs” of ageing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Exercise helps defuse the “time bombs of ageing”. Conversely, being a long-term couch potato increases the risk of 33 chronic diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, atherosclerosis, lung disease and metabolic syndrome, Wright says. This is known as “sedentary death syndrome”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3.7"&gt;&lt;div id="932b9c88-9414-48a9-8f6a-635d33507d9e"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Perform fewer reps with heavier weights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“There is not an organ system in our body that is not affected by mobility,” she says. Flexing biceps or squatting doesn’t just build muscle, it produces chemicals that help build brain tissue and promote insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;As for the ageing “time bombs”, they include DNA damage such as telomere shortening — according to Wright just six months of aerobic activity lengthens telomeres, which protect our genetic data. Another is “inflammaging”, chronic low-grade inflammation contributing factors for which can include stress and menopause. For Wright, structured cardio and resistance training, plus an anti-inflammatory diet, are the answer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/over-50-osteoporosis-health-help-anna-maxted-72trtxz59" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I’m 55, eat well, don’t smoke and exercise. Yet I also have osteoporosis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The third bomb? Dysfunction of the mitochondria. These “power plants” of our cells convert food into energy and if they’re in poor shape, metabolic problems follow. But running, swimming and cycling help create new mitochondria. Another time bomb is cell senescence, where damaged “zombie cells” contribute to inflammation. Just 12 weeks of moderate aerobic exercise can decrease their numbers and improve macroautophagy, our cells’ self-cleaning mechanism, Wright says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Understand the musculoskeletal syndrome of menopause&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In a recent paper Wright defined “the musculoskeletal syndrome of menopause”, joining the dots for the 70 per cent of women who suffer from a host of apparently unrelated symptoms, including joint stiffness, muscle loss and fat gain. Muscle, Wright says, is “the engine that drives your health span”. Not only does it help regulate blood sugar and metabolism, it churns out hormones that protect brain and heart, and helps keep bones strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Menopause ratchets up muscle loss (and increases inflammation). “Oestrogen plays a critical role in muscle health and muscle protein synthesis,” Wright says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Our bones, tendons, ligaments and cartilage are similarly affected by oestrogen’s decline. So less oestrogen in say, cartilage, and women suddenly suffer far more arthritis than men, Wright says. As for bones, they don’t just hold us up, they secrete the hormone osteocalcin, which helps the brain by increasing neurotransmitter production, and aids insulin sensitivity and glucose regulation. Oestrogen is critical for bone and women experience a “precipitous drop in up to 20 per cent of bone density in the five to seven years surrounding menopause”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/fit-for-age-exercises-8whjncsxm" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Am I fit for my age? Exercises for your 30s to your 70s&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Wright is a big fan of HRT for osteoporosis prevention but it’s not a cure-all, she says. To become strong, she says, “You still must invest in the physical, the nutritional, the social.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Flexibility is crucial — but Pilates should be the ‘garnish’ &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Wright prescribes exercise using the acronym FACE (Flexibility and mobility; aerobic capacity; ability to carry a load; and equilibrium and foot speed). Maintaining flexibility should be a “several times a week” practice: stretching helps combat the effects of ageing on tendon and ligaments. Otherwise, she says, “our joints lose mobility, our tendons and ligaments get tighter. It’s why we see people shuffling down the street instead of striding”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;While regular yoga, Pilates and barre improve muscle endurance and prevent stiffness, Wright adds that “they do not create any significant lean muscle mass gain or absolute power”. She describes Pilates as — gulp — “garnish”. “I’m not saying ‘give it up, people’,” she says. “I’m saying, ‘It’s never going to be enough.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3.23"&gt;&lt;div id="6a9c9161-45e2-42ef-9703-879fecafca30"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Even 10 to 20 jump  repetitions a  day  can increase  strength&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Jump around&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Jump training (or plyometrics) increases our power, speed and athleticism. Wright says that springing up forces us to use our fast-twitch muscles, which decline with age, and then it “forces us to land”. This signals to the body to build more bone. Some midlife women avoid jumping, often because of pelvic-floor trouble, “But pelvic floors can be retrained”, Wright says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;You don’t have to leap onto a 24in box (as Wright does). Skipping or hopscotch is great, and just 10 to 20 jump repetitions a day can increase bone mass and strength. As a convert to the joys of midlife jumping, I tell Wright that it’s amazing to feel springy as opposed to leaden. “I love that you said that,” she exclaims. “There’s a certain ableness that comes from ‘I can run up those stairs! Getting over this barrier is nothing because I’m jumping!’ It’s mind and body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/hrt-what-every-woman-needs-to-know-now-jjv8prxdq" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;HRT: what every woman needs to know now&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;In midlife don’t HIIT it too hard&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Too much high-intensity interval training (HIIT) in midlife is counterproductive, Wright says. A 2021 study found that while two to three HIIT sessions per week improved volunteers’ health, when they increased it to five their mitochondria produced less energy, plus they developed impaired glucose tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In midlife you’re prone to injury from overuse. Plus, Wright says, “because it’s hard, you’ll elevate your cortisol every day”. It can lead to issues such as elevated blood sugar and higher blood pressure. When midlife women tell Wright they exercise daily but are gaining weight, this is often why, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Wright describes exercise in terms of zones one to five, “with zone one being very little effort and zone five being as hard as you can go”. She recommends that 80 per cent of your cardio training is in zone two — you’ll know you’re there if you could manage a phone call, talking in full sentences, but the other person would be able to tell you were exerting yourself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The remaining 20 per cent of your training should be in zone five. This ratio is great for “metabolic flexibility”. But most people “work in the middle” — around zones three and four, she says. As well as raising cortisol, “It’s not as efficient at maintaining metabolic flexibility. And it doesn’t really recompose their body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For her zone two exercise Wright walks on a treadmill at an incline of 5 per cent, at four miles per hour for 45 minutes. Then, “I punch the button up to 11. And I’m just going as fast as my short legs will carry me and not fly off the back.” Try also, bike, rower, sprints, battle ropes — whatever “jacks your heart rate up.” (This is called SIT — sprint interval training). Do this for 30 seconds, then recover over two minutes, and repeat up to four times. With your doctor’s blessing, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3.36"&gt;&lt;div id="b91c4c46-9292-4c6a-86fc-d1a53ebc19b0"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Bench presses: try four sets of four reps using higher weights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;How to lift for power&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“I don’t lift weights to look good in my little black dress,” Wright says. “The goal of the way I prescribe lifting is strength — to be able to pick up my 40-pound grandson or to put things away without having to ask the neighbour to come help me, for God’s sake.” Also, “Power to get up off the floor and power to catch myself so I don’t land on the floor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/boost-your-bones-with-exercise-hd78njjw8" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The 7 best exercises to keep your bones strong&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;This is surely what we all want but will 20 biceps curls with 5kg weights do it? “There are many ways to lift. None of them are wrong. But what is our goal?” Wright says. “Well, if our goal is to build endurance — carry a backpack up Machu Picchu or something — then do exactly what you said: lift the lightest possible weight, the most possible times.” She pauses. “That is not my goal as a midlife woman and beyond.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;To age with max badassery, she says we should do lower reps of higher weights — for example, with bench presses she’d prescribe four sets of four reps. You work almost to failure, meaning, “We could lift a fifth bench press — but we cannot lift six.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;It’s a learnt skill and can take nine months to grasp. “Once we learn to lift heavy, and we feel comfortable, that’s when we can add speed to our lifts,” she adds — so doing a squat, “We go down slow, 1, 2, 3, then we explode up”. This builds power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Technique is crucial, so it’s worth going all in. “This isn’t the time to ask for a new purse for Christmas again,” Wright says. “Let’s invest in a trainer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Unbreakable: A Woman’s Guide to Ageing with Power &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;by Vonda Wright is out now (Vermilion, £20)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxPVExKcjl6NTF2ZnE0TncxcmZBaVZxZTZkdmRROVIzNGkxazA3bS1LaHFYc195Q09GdjQ1UWJDU2VJdjlpVVpGcmktcGtMWGloRm10NURvV29ic2lUUXBKeVNHOGxLZlVkSGZMN0NnMmZIbGpMLXhKV29Pd1ZKWTdsTTRWRTB6dkNucFVwelFwRXg4RklLMDlpQjFwUDhaWlp4OUJrdTBiYkg1QjR4LV9ycF9tZHdZVFNya3ZlT2dn</guid></item><item><title>心理学家发现，自恋者被一种特定的新闻故事所吸引- PsyPost</title><link>https://www.psypost.org/narcissists-are-drawn-to-a-particular-kind-of-news-story-psychologists-find/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2025.104653" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Research in Personality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; suggests that individuals high in antagonistic narcissism are more likely to gravitate toward antisocial news content while showing less interest in stories about prosocial behavior. This tendency appears to be related to lower levels of empathy and a greater need for intense stimulation, traits commonly linked with antagonistic forms of narcissism. The findings point to a psychological pattern in how narcissistic individuals consume social information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Narcissistic individuals tend to display a grandiose view of themselves, a preoccupation with status, and low regard for others. Much prior research has explored how narcissists behave in interpersonal situations—as the central actors or “protagonists”—often revealing a pattern of manipulative or hostile behavior. But social life also includes observing others, such as through news and media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study focused on what narcissists prefer to observe, particularly in terms of prosocial (helping) versus antisocial (harming) behavior in others. Prior work had already shown that narcissists often respond more favorably to antisocial behavior in others and evaluate prosocial individuals more negatively. What remained unknown was whether this pattern began even earlier in the information-processing pipeline: in the initial act of choosing what to pay attention to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers proposed that narcissists, especially those high in antagonistic traits such as arrogance and aggression, may prefer antisocial news content that reflects their own worldview. Drawing on person-environment fit theory, they suggested that individuals are drawn to environments and information that align with their own traits and values. In this case, narcissistic individuals may experience a better fit with antisocial content and a poorer fit with prosocial material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Broadly, my research is motivated by an interest in how narcissistic individuals engage with the communal side of social life — aspects such as cooperation, morality, and kindness,” said study author Jiafang Chen of the University of Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This angle has received much less attention compared to the traditional focus on power, achievement, and social status. I believe that examining the communal dimension offers fresh insights into how narcissists shape their social environments, especially since they often end up in leadership positions and serve as role models. A natural starting point is to examine how narcissistic individuals are drawn to different kinds of social information in daily life, which both reflects who they are and reinforces their behavioral patterns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research involved two main studies and a set of pilot studies to design the news headline task. First, the team created and tested news headlines classified as antisocial, prosocial, or neutral. They made sure these headlines differed in perceived social impact but were equally interesting and exciting to read. This allowed them to isolate the effects of narcissistic traits on content preference without confounding factors like novelty or shock value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, antisocial headlines included: “Supervisor sexually harasses multiple interns” and “Mother and daughter throw stones at sleeping animals in a zoo.” Prosocial headlines featured examples like “Steep increase in blood donors” and “Passerby helps fallen blind person get up.” Neutral headlines included more observational or factual events, such as “First passengers try high-speed vacuum pods” or “250 million users active on Snapchat each day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first main study, 253 participants completed a narcissism questionnaire and then chose ten out of thirty news headlines they would like to read. The headlines were evenly distributed among the antisocial, prosocial, and neutral categories. The researchers found that people with higher levels of antagonistic narcissism were more likely to pick antisocial headlines and less likely to select prosocial ones, compared to those lower in antagonistic narcissism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second study replicated these findings in a separate sample of 294 participants. This time, the researchers also measured three possible underlying traits that could explain the narcissists’ choices: their social motives, their capacity for empathy, and their level of sensation seeking. The idea was that narcissists might choose antisocial information not simply because they enjoy it, but because it better fits with their internal traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings showed that narcissistic individuals were less empathetic and more likely to seek intense, novel experiences—both of which were linked to a stronger preference for antisocial content and a weaker interest in prosocial content. Importantly, these two traits (low empathy and high sensation seeking) statistically accounted for the relationship between narcissism and information preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across both studies, the data provided consistent evidence that antagonistic narcissism is associated with a selective preference for antisocial social information. In the first study, this pattern was clear: narcissistic individuals picked more antisocial and fewer prosocial headlines. In the second study, the effect was driven more by their reduced interest in prosocial stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that this selection pattern was not random or incidental. When they analyzed what explained these choices, two key psychological traits emerged. Narcissistic individuals tended to score lower in affective empathy—the ability to feel compassion for others—which predicted a dislike for prosocial stories and a relative openness to antisocial ones. They also scored higher in sensation seeking, which predicted a stronger interest in stories involving harm, rule-breaking, or social conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, social motives—whether participants were more self-focused or altruistic—did not significantly mediate the effect. The authors suggest that simply being focused on one’s own outcomes may not be enough to explain why narcissists are attracted to antisocial content. Instead, the emotional detachment and desire for stimulation seen in these individuals may be more relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A follow-up meta-analysis combining data from both studies confirmed that antagonistic narcissism reliably predicted a preference for antisocial over prosocial information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main takeaway from our findings is that narcissistic individuals are more drawn to antisocial information—stories about others’ misbehavior—while showing less interest in prosocial information, such as acts of kindness or cooperation,” Chen told PsyPost. “This preference can be explained by their low affective empathy and heightened sensation-seeking tendencies. Together, these findings suggest that narcissists’ selection of social information not only reflects who they are but also reinforces their characteristic ways of engaging with the social world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are some limitations to consider. While the studies employed a task that mirrored real-life media consumption, they relied on self-reported data and correlational designs. This makes it difficult to draw conclusions about causality. For instance, it is not clear whether choosing antisocial content leads narcissists to behave more antisocially themselves—or whether these behaviors are simply consistent across domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that the study focused only on one specific form of narcissism: the antagonistic subtype. Narcissism is a complex and multidimensional trait that also includes more agentic (status-seeking) and neurotic (insecure) forms. While the authors did briefly explore these other dimensions, they found that antagonistic narcissism had the strongest and most consistent association with antisocial information preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could explore whether repeatedly consuming antisocial content reinforces narcissists’ existing tendencies or shapes their behaviors over time. It might also test whether increasing exposure to prosocial stories could nudge narcissistic individuals toward more cooperative or empathetic actions. Some evidence suggests that such “communal activation” can temporarily soften narcissistic traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also recommend further work on other psychological traits—such as schadenfreude or envy—that may explain why some individuals take pleasure in others’ misfortunes and seek out news reflecting those scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2025.104653" target="_blank"&gt;You are what you read: Antagonistic narcissism predicts increased preference for antisocial and reduced preference for prosocial information&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jiafang Chen, Barbara Nevicka, Astrid C.

&lt;p&gt;“If you want to build muscle mass, engage in a regular program of strength training or resistance exercise, and focus on healthy food sources of protein,” Mozaffarian said. “Otherwise, emphasize a generally healthy diet, and rather than being obsessed with protein, seek out minimally processed fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, whole grains, plant oils, fish and yogurt. Avoid soda, candy, processed meat and ultraprocessed foods high in starch, sugar or salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Focus on the food source and its overall impact on your health, rather than the grams of protein,” Mozaffarian said. “Avoid processed meats, ultraprocessed foods like protein bars and protein powders.

Unprocessed red meats are OK in moderation, up to two servings per week.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A new study has identified a link between mental health and the stomach, a region of the gut rarely covered in research on the complex interplay between the central nervous system and the digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the stomach and the brain have a constant pattern of electrical waves pulsing through them, on a low level, and it was found that the more in sync these two patterns are, the higher the chance of someone being &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/worldwide-review-finds-most-people-with-depression-aren-t-getting-treatment"&gt;in mental distress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted by a team from Aarhus University in Denmark and the German Institute of Human Nutrition. The researchers hope that we might eventually be able to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/people-are-self-diagnosing-mental-illness-is-it-helpful-or-harmful"&gt;diagnose certain mental health issues&lt;/a&gt; more precisely, or earlier, via stomach signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-extra-sense-may-connect-gut-bacteria-with-our-brain"&gt;An Extra Sense May Connect Gut Bacteria With Our Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Intuitively, we assume stronger body-brain communication is a sign of health," &lt;a href="https://health.au.dk/en/display/artikel/the-stomachs-brain-is-more-in-sync-with-the-mind-during-mental-distress"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Micah Allen from Aarhus University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But here, unusually strong stomach-brain coupling seems linked to greater psychological burden – perhaps a system under strain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171846" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171846" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/MentalHealth.jpg" alt="Mental health questionnaire" class="wp-image-171846 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/MentalHealth.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/MentalHealth-600x333.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171846" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mental health was assessed through questionnaires. (Banellis et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were able to obtain &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging"&gt;full brain scan data&lt;/a&gt; (across 209 brain regions), full stomach scan data, and mental health questionnaires for 199 participants, and this information was then statistically analyzed to look for links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stronger syncing or coupling between &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-waves-can-be-manipulated-while-we-dream-and-it-could-help-treat-dementia"&gt;brain waves&lt;/a&gt; and stomach waves was associated with a higher chance of mental health issues such as anxiety,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="171843" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, and stress. Weaker coupling meant a higher chance of better mental health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data isn't enough to show that stomach activity is directly triggering &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cortex-transcriptome-overlap-different-mental-illnesses"&gt;mental illness&lt;/a&gt; or vice versa, and we don't know yet why these connections exist. However, it's a relationship that we may be able to make use of, with further research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It builds on what we already know about the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteric_nervous_system"&gt;enteric nervous system&lt;/a&gt; in the gut, connected to the brain via the vagus nerve. Past research has linked this 'second brain' to conditions &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/science-keeps-finding-links-between-autism-and-gut-problems"&gt;such as autism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/changes-in-gut-bacteria-are-present-long-before-signs-of-parkinsons-appear"&gt;neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This part of the gut has been largely ignored," &lt;a href="https://health.au.dk/en/display/artikel/the-stomachs-brain-is-more-in-sync-with-the-mind-during-mental-distress"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Leah Banellis from Aarhus University. "Most research focuses on the microbiome and lower digestive system. Our results suggest stomach rhythms are also deeply tied to emotional well-being."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be tricky to accurately diagnose mental health problems, with different conditions often overlapping, problems being overlooked &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4088/PCC.10m01013"&gt;or misdiagnosed&lt;/a&gt;, and people being reluctant or unable to identify what the issues are. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hidden-signals-can-reveal-mental-illness-more-clearly-than-a-brain-scan"&gt;Having other markers&lt;/a&gt; for a more precise diagnosis would be very useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further down the line it might even be possible to adjust feedback from the stomach – the gastric rhythm – to alleviate the symptoms of mental health issues, but that's a long way off. For now, the researchers want to gather more data on bigger and more diverse groups to see if these patterns can be replicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know certain medications and even the foods we eat can influence gastric rhythms," &lt;a href="https://health.au.dk/en/display/artikel/the-stomachs-brain-is-more-in-sync-with-the-mind-during-mental-distress"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Allen. "One day, this research might help us tailor treatments based on how a patient's body and brain interact – not just what they report feeling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44220-025-00468-6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It also puts patients at risk of an infection, or life-threatening &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/sepsis/index.html" id="mol-188c1ee0-851c-11f0-bc97-090efcca62a4"&gt;sepsis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it was another five months before Latimer went to the hospital, according to the lawsuit she recently filed against the doctor and his clinic, saying she that the surgeon and clinic kept assuring her she was 'progressing nicely'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Latimer saw Dr Salgado three times after her nipples turned black, according to the lawsuit, who prescribed her creams to repair 'superficial skin damage'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Latimer also exchanged numerous texts with the clinic, regularly submitting pictures of her deteriorating nipples and areolas for Dr Salgado to review, the lawsuit says, but was told that there was nothing to be concerned about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above texts, included in Latimer's lawsuit, were sent by Latimer to the clinic after she said her nipples had fallen off&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ahead of the publication of this story, DailyMail.com contacted Dr Salgado and The Secret Plastic Surgery for comment but did not receive a response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Latimer first contacted the clinic in July 2023 on the advice of a friend, and was initially approved for the surgeries by Dr Orlando Llorente. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, after a blood test showed she had a low red blood cell count, raising the risk of infections or complications such as cardiac arrest, the procedure was canceled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Latimer had also had a breast lift about a decade earlier, which can make a second surgery more risky because there may be scar tissue from the first procedure that is disrupting the blood supply to the chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Latimer thought she would not be able to get the surgery, but about two weeks later, the clinic contacted her again and said Dr Salgado had agreed to do her operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She went for the procedure on August 22, with her lawyers saying in filings that no breast exam or inspection of scar tissue was carried out before the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the complaint, the day after the surgery, she returned to the clinic to have photos taken, which showed her nipples were already black and full of blood. She alleges she was not offered any treatments at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Salgado saw her again about a month after the surgery, telling her, according to the lawsuit, that she was recovering well, despite the color of her nipples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Machelle Latimer, 46, pictured above at home in Miami, Florida. She is seeking a trial by jury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He applied collagen to the nipples and areolas, the lawsuit claimed, a treatment that can be used to repair damaged skin, and told her to return in two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her breasts continued to deteriorate, however, with Latimer texting in more photos to the clinic in October that still showed black skin over her nipples and areolas, indicating that the nipples and areolas had died on the left breast and partially died on the right breast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her left breast was also swollen, which could be a sign of infection, the complaint sets out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It took nine days for Dr Salgado to respond to her texts, via the clinic. When he did, he prescribed her collagenase cream, according to the lawsuit, which is typically used to clean and remove dead tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Latimer texted pictures of her breasts to the clinic again in early November, showing an inflamed area around her nipples and areolas, which were completely black. On her right breast, the nipple was coming away, revealing puss underneath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She wrote: '[My breasts] feel tender on both sides. I noticed a profound indent on the right side.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The clinic did respond, and set up her meeting with Dr Salgado on November 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During this appointment, the doctor wrote in his notes, according to the lawsuit, that Latimer stated 'great satisfaction'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also wrote that both her nipples and areolas were 'compromised' and the implants 'may not be salvageable', and that he told her to go to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite this, Dr Salgado and the clinic are claimed to have said that Latimer was still 'progressing nicely'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The insurance sales assistant is pictured above with her dog. She said the loss of her nipples has left her struggling with intimacy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Latimer did not go to the hospital, but sent repeated text messages to her contact number at the clinic, according to the lawsuit, and received responses assuring her that her breasts were still 'progressing nicely'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her lawyers said she did not seek treatment from the hospital because she was continuously assured by Dr Salgado and his clinic that she was healing well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On November 17, she wrote: &lt;span&gt;'Hi any response from Dr Salgado yet?'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three days later, she texted again: 'Hi, any response from Dr Salgado on my progress from the photos I sent you on Thursday?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three hours later, the assistant replied: 'He says it's really progressing nicely.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At her next appointment with Dr Salgado on January 5, 2024, the doctor found, according to the lawsuit, t&lt;span&gt;hat she had completely lost her left nipple and partially lost the right nipple. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;He prescribed Dakin's solution, a bleach solution that is used on dead tissue to stop bacterial growth. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On January 14, Latimer contacted the clinic to inform them that her left nipple had fallen off, that the left implant was exposed from her breast, and that her right nipple had also fallen off, causing a large indent in her right breast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She went to the hospital on January 17, also experiencing breast pain, foul smelling drainage from her breasts and swelling in the area, the lawsuit sets out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An image included in the complaint and allegedly taken the day after the surgery shows that Latimer's nipples have turned jet black&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was admitted to the hospital for IV antibiotics and two surgeries to remove her left and right implants and affected tissue. Doctors at the hospital noted a major infection, abscess and extensive tissue damage to the skin and breasts, according to the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to the ordeal, Latimer said she now struggles with intimacy and said she had a regular pain in her left arm.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Tiffany Troso-Sandoval, a breast cancer oncologist in New York who reviewed the case for this website, said: 'The patient is lucky to be alive actually, and very lucky that this did not progress to full-blown sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It needed to have been addressed much earlier than it was because the tissue was dying, and when she finally got to the ER there was a massive infection in both of her breasts.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Revealing her case for the first time with DailyMail.com, she told this website: '&lt;span&gt;I’m grateful [to have] a voice to fight for accountability for what happened to me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I’ve filed this lawsuit because I want to ensure that what I’ve gone through does not happen to anyone else ever again, and I’m hopeful that this will encourage others to have the courage to advocate for themselves and their health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 18:20:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQRXhrWVR4WmFpRkUwSHlwSG5Ja3NKRDlnMWhnWnowU19GUzhLdEpzVW0zZnhTUmZoc2JwX2RqazZWZkZNdDFJQ0tIQ3pRWGpNX0EyQks0bTA0dGluRWFfT1FKLXdUYllpemQwRHIyNzFBbW1ySE1TQkNiN3p4SmdzVmh2N3hlaG1kaGtsdFFTM0szbFhubzhiSUJOaFpnYmtkdGVfbWZaUV_SAa4BQVVfeXFMT2xYOWlGbENQTlRqaHA1Q215U3JvQnRLQlhFcUZtcnV6b3hKNW5Ua0p3aTlfWjg0WlhJMElMSFNILTdXOTNiV0ZzdUVqZVhDNUtoOHRhSnZseHA2a0hQQmZDOXJ2RUxRS3R2bFpmMHJhUUk1MUFVdGNscHo0UHRyeWZ6TnlOYk9NdTk4emNnWEstS1N0Wk4wc2Q1MlQ0SDBiVWVWV0V5NTlOb1g3TE9B</guid></item><item><title>情感依恋不安全的人更容易产生社交焦虑- PsyPost</title><link>https://www.psypost.org/people-with-insecure-affective-attachment-are-more-likely-to-be-socially-anxious/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A meta-analysis of studies investigating the association between affective attachment and social anxiety found that individuals with insecure attachment are more likely to experience social anxiety. The paper was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/02654075251337887"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Social and Personal Relationships&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social anxiety is a mental health condition characterized by intense fear or worry about being judged, embarrassed, or negatively evaluated in social situations. It often develops during adolescence, when self-awareness and sensitivity to peer evaluation increase. Genetic predisposition, temperament traits such as shyness, and environmental factors like overprotective parenting or bullying can contribute to its onset. Early negative social experiences, such as humiliation or rejection, may also reinforce anxious responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing social anxiety is important because it can significantly impair education, career opportunities, and relationships. People with social anxiety may avoid speaking in class, meeting new people, or pursuing jobs that involve public interaction. If left untreated, it can lead to isolation, low self-esteem, and secondary problems such as depression or substance use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Yihan Zhang and colleagues sought to systematize the findings of prior research on affective attachment and social anxiety. Affective attachment refers to the deep emotional bonds individuals form with significant others. It develops early in life through interactions with caregivers, where consistent responsiveness fosters secure attachment and inconsistent or neglectful care can lead to insecure patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attachment patterns can be described using two psychological traits: attachment &lt;strong&gt;anxiety&lt;/strong&gt; (fear of rejection or abandonment) and &lt;strong&gt;avoidance&lt;/strong&gt; (discomfort with closeness and dependence). Individuals low on both traits are considered securely attached, while those with high levels of one or both are considered insecurely attached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers searched six scientific databases (ERIC, PsycINFO, PubMed, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, Scopus, and Web of Science) for studies containing attachment and social anxiety or social phobia as keywords. This search yielded 2,224 records. After excluding studies that did not meet inclusion criteria, 42 papers were retained for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, the included studies involved 21,332 participants, with mean ages ranging from 19 to 44 years. Gender distribution varied widely, with some studies including only one gender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eighty percent of the studies reported a non-zero association between insecure attachment and social anxiety. On average, the strength of this association was in the low-to-medium range, though it varied considerably across studies. The association’s strength depended on the type of insecure attachment—whether characterized by high avoidance, high anxiety, or both—as well as on the method used to assess attachment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This meta-analysis confirmed that insecure attachment is significantly and positively related to social anxiety. Additionally, we found that the subcategory of insecure attachment and the instrument used to measure insecure attachment act as significant moderators that influence the association between insecure attachment and social anxiety,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on the links between affective attachment pattern and social anxiety.

She can also use the same mental machinery to imagine future events with striking richness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists call this autobiographical &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/autobiographical-memory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;, the long term store of events from our own lives that includes &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/memory-isnt-only-stored-in-our-brains-other-cells-can-remember-too/"&gt;feelings&lt;/a&gt;, places, and people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive scientists also speak of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11752477/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;autonoetic consciousness&lt;/a&gt;, the reflective awareness that lets us mentally re-experience a past moment and place ourselves in a future one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hyperthymesia-autobiographical-memory"&gt;Hyperthymesia – autobiographical memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new paper is led by &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Valentina-La-Corte" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Valentina La Corte&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://u-paris.fr/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Paris Cité University&lt;/a&gt; and the Paris Brain Institute (&lt;a href="https://parisbraininstitute.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PBI&lt;/a&gt;). The phenomenon itself is rare, and a comprehensive &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11965258/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; notes that the literature is still small and methods vary across studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In these individuals, known as hyperthymesics, memories are carefully indexed by date. Some will be able to describe in detail what they did [on a specific date], and experience again the emotions and sensations of that day,” explained La Corte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case centers on TL (initials that do not correspond to her real name were given to preserve her anonymity), a 17 year old who does not just recall, she organizes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She reports fine grained control over access to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-prepares-the-brain-for-the-future-while-protecting-memories-of-the-past/"&gt;memories&lt;/a&gt; that many others with hyperthymesia do not describe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-she-organizes-memories"&gt;How she organizes memories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL distinguishes a factual store she calls black memory from the personal trove that matters to her sense of self. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She sorts that personal trove in an internal archive she calls the white room, where memories are arranged in binders by theme and date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She places hard experiences in containers to keep their emotional impact manageable, like a chest holding the death of a grandparent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also created adjacent rooms for anger, problems, and even a military room that appeared when her father left for service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mental layout seen in hyperthymesia cases is unusual because it blends chronology, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-and-inexpensive-supplement-prebiotic-fructooligosaccharides-protects-your-brain-from-dementia/"&gt;emotion&lt;/a&gt; regulation, and self narrative in one controllable space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It reflects an effort to keep intrusive details in check without losing access to information that still matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-testing-hyperthymesia"&gt;Testing hyperthymesia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used established tools that probe memory for life events and the feeling of mentally traveling through time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of them, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19524095/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;TEMPau&lt;/a&gt;, measures the sense of reliving across a person’s lifespan and separates richly lived episodes from facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also used the Temporal Extended Autobiographical Memory task (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022096513000398" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;TEEAM&lt;/a&gt;) to extend the timeline and gauge how easily she can move across past and future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across tasks, TL produced unusually vivid, detailed reports and could shift perspective between first person and observer viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also considered accuracy. People with very strong autobiographical memory remain vulnerable to distortions, and prior &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1314373110" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that even highly superior autobiographical memory participants can form false memories under standard laboratory tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-hyperthymesia-matters"&gt;Why hyperthymesia matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This case is not only about the past. Evidence shows that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-brains-use-storage-trick-to-keep-your-memories-in-sequential-order/"&gt;remembering&lt;/a&gt; and imagining recruit overlapping cognitive and neural systems, a point advanced by influential &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17700624/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When TL constructs rich scenes about tomorrow, she appears to harness the same machinery that helps her rebuild yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That overlap matters for everyday life. The ability to plan with concrete, sensory details is linked to better goal setting, clearer time estimates, and a stronger sense of identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also offers a window into clinical puzzles. If future thinking and remembering share processes, then changes that blunt rich recall may also weaken the ability to imagine next week in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across published work, highly superior autobiographical memory often involves fast, date anchored retrieval and abundant sensory detail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A systematic &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11965258/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; reports patterns of overactivation in autobiographical memory networks, including visual regions, during recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, structural brain differences are not consistent across cases. Functional connectivity differences sometimes appear, but anatomy alone does not explain the skill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-human-costs-and-benefits"&gt;Human costs and benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many reported cases carry emotional downsides because painful memories can flood awareness. TL’s approach is notable because she uses mental tools to tag and quarantine difficult episodes without erasing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That strategy raises practical questions for therapy and education. If people can be taught to structure personal memories with themes and timelines, perhaps they can gain clarity without amplifying distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also raises ethical questions. A mind that retrieves with this intensity may feel compelled to revisit moments that others allow to fade, which can complicate decision making and mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field still needs better tools to check the accuracy of distant life events against real dates and sources. It also needs longitudinal data to see whether abilities like TL’s change with age or with life transitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is difficult to generalize findings about hyperthymesia, since they rely on only a few cases,” concluded La Corte. The next wave of studies will need larger samples, tighter validation, and standardized tasks across labs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13554794.2025.2537950" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurocase&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 18:06:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxNbmVaZC1NdnFCcEczekZoRFhHT0ZqZFlreWZPWWpibnkyYldHVExmeUFjRUJiazROZjVweGRQR0Z5Y21ndVo0YTZscUI2Y2xKRndNSnV1cEtPN0N5VEI2dFJxYVdmM3BoOEo2elZfLVdfMVZTc2JXcno5Q0hCcy1tYmF3NE81QXc0dy15T3ZDdHBhX1hJcnZ4ZUFvNA</guid></item><item><title>极端高温使人们更加负面-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/neuroscience-heat-negativity-29647/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A large-scale global study shows that extreme heat affects not just our bodies, but also our emotions. Researchers analyzed over a billion social media posts and found that when temperatures exceeded 95°F (35°C), expressed sentiments became more negative, particularly in lower-income countries where effects were three times stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight how rising global temperatures shape daily emotional experiences worldwide. Looking ahead, climate models suggest that by 2100, extreme heat alone could worsen global emotional well-being by 2.3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scale of Analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; 1.2 billion posts across 65 languages from 157 countries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heat Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; Sentiment became 25% more negative in lower-income countries vs. 8% in higher-income ones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Projection:&lt;/strong&gt; By 2100, extreme heat could reduce global emotional well-being by 2.3%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;MIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rising global temperatures affect human activity in many ways. Now, a new study illuminates an important dimension of the problem: Very hot days are associated with more negative moods, as shown by a large-scale look at social media postings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the study examines 1.2 billion social media posts from 157 countries over the span of a year. The research finds that when the temperature rises above 95 degrees Fahrenheit, or 35 degrees Celsius, expressed sentiments become about 25 percent more negative in lower-income countries and about 8 percent more negative in better-off countries. Extreme heat affects people emotionally, not just physically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study reveals that rising temperatures don’t just threaten physical health or economic productivity — they also affect how people feel, every day, all over the world,” says Siqi Zheng, a professor in MIT’s Department of Urban Studies and Planning (DUSP) and Center for Real Estate (CRE), and co-author of a new paper detailing the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work opens up a new frontier in understanding how climate stress is shaping human well-being at a planetary scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “Unequal Impacts of Rising Temperatures on Global Human Sentiment,” is published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;One Earth&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors are Jianghao Wang, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nicolas Guetta-Jeanrenaud SM ’22, a graduate of MIT’s Technology and Policy Program (TPP) and Institute for Data, Systems, and Society; Juan Palacios, a visiting assistant professor at MIT’s Sustainable Urbanization Lab (SUL) and an assistant professor Maastricht University; Yichun Fan, of SUL and Duke University; Devika Kakkar, of Harvard University; Nick Obradovich, of SUL and the Laureate Institute for Brain Research in Tulsa; and Zheng, who is the STL Champion Professor of Urban and Real Estate Sustainability at CRE and DUSP. Zheng is also the faculty director of CRE and founded the Sustainable Urbanization Lab in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social media as a window&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conduct the study, the researchers evaluated 1.2 billion posts from the social media platforms Twitter and Weibo, all of which appeared in 2019. They used a natural language processing technique called Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), to analyze 65 languages across the 157 countries in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each social media post was given a sentiment rating from 0.0 (for very negative posts) to 1.0 (for very positive posts). The posts were then aggregated geographically to 2,988 locations and evaluated in correlation with area weather. From this method, the researchers could then deduce the connection between extreme temperatures and expressed sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Social media data provides us with an unprecedented window into human emotions across cultures and continents,” Wang says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This approach allows us to measure emotional impacts of climate change at a scale that traditional surveys simply cannot achieve, giving us real-time insights into how temperature affects human sentiment worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess the effects of temperatures on sentiment in higher-income and middle-to-lower-income settings, the scholars also used a World Bank cutoff level of gross national income per-capita annual income of $13,845, finding that in places with incomes below that, the effects of heat on mood were triple those found in economically more robust settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Thanks to the global coverage of our data, we find that people in low- and middle-income countries experience sentiment declines from extreme heat that are three times greater than those in high-income countries,” Fan says. “This underscores the importance of incorporating adaptation into future climate impact projections.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the long run&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using long-term global climate models, and expecting some adaptation to heat, the researchers also produced a long-range estimate of the effects of extreme temperatures on sentiment by the year 2100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extending the current findings to that time frame, they project a 2.3 percent worsening of people’s emotional well-being based on high temperatures alone by then — although that is a far-range projection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s clear now, with our present study adding to findings from prior studies, that weather alters sentiment on a global scale,” Obradovich says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And as weather and climates change, helping individuals become more resilient to shocks to their emotional states will be an important component of overall societal adaptation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that there are many nuances to the subject, and room for continued research in this area. For one thing, social media users are not likely to be a perfectly representative portion of the population, with young children and the elderly almost certainly using social media less than other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as the researchers observe in the paper, the very young and elderly are probably particularly vulnerable to heat shocks, making the response to hot weather possible even larger than their study can capture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research is part of the Global Sentiment project led by the MIT Sustainable Urbanization Lab, and the study’s dataset is publicly available. Zheng and other co-authors have previously investigated these dynamics using social media, although never before at this scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope this resource helps researchers, policymakers, and communities better prepare for a warming world,” Zheng says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was supported, in part, by Zheng’s chaired professorship research fund, and grants Wang received from the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this temperature and mood research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Peter Dizikes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MIT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Peter Dizikes – MIT&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/one-earth/abstract/S2590-3322(25)00248-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Unequal impacts of rising temperatures on global human sentiment&lt;/a&gt;” by Jianghao Wang et al. &lt;em&gt;One Earth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unequal impacts of rising temperatures on global human sentiment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Climate change poses growing risks to human well-being, yet research on its emotional impact has primarily focused on developed nations, obscuring potential global inequalities in psychological vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we analyze over 1.2 billion social media posts from 157 countries to reveal how rising temperatures affect human sentiment worldwide and project future impacts under climate scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We find a non-linear relationship where moderate warming can improve sentiment in cooler regions, but temperatures above 35°C negatively impact emotional well-being globally, with effects three times greater in low- and middle-income countries (25.0% decline in sentiment) than in high-income countries (8.1%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even accounting for climate adaptation through income growth, we project global average sentiment will be 2.3% lower in 2100 than in 2019 due to future warming, indicating lasting psychological costs disproportionately burdening the world’s poorest populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings underscore the urgent need for climate policies that integrate emotional impacts and address inequalities in psychological climate vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 17:48:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE5LaE5lWEVVVmNQQjNqZ1hJRXUwOTBoMzUzSjBnbnJzalRsWndYTERhY3hDcGNyaVZpalRlU0JjV3JZdFZjMVZoOTllSDZtQndfOHJBNGN1LTBWZUF6N2FfTFh3VlcybXQxa3J3bTF2SzhMZw</guid></item><item><title>常见病毒可以帮助驱动帕金森氏症吗？ -神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/hpgv-virus-parkinsons-29646/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research suggests a previously harmless virus may be linked to Parkinson’s disease.

We searched for all known human-infecting viruses to identify any differences between the two groups.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Northwestern Medicine researchers detected the Human Pegivirus (HPgV) in the brains of individuals with Parkinson’s disease, but not in those without it. While HPgV belongs to the same family as hepatitis C and is a blood-borne virus, it is not known to cause any disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“HPgV is a common, symptomless infection previously not known to frequently infect the brain,” Dr. Koralnik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised to find it in the brains of Parkinson’s patients at such high frequency and not in the controls. Even more unexpected was how the immune system responded differently, depending on a person’s genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests it could be an environmental factor that interacts with the body in ways we didn’t realize before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For a virus that was thought to be harmless, these findings suggest it may have important effects, in the context of Parkinson’s disease. It may influence how Parkinson’s develops, especially in people with certain genetic backgrounds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Koralnik and his team including post-doctoral fellow Barbara Hanson, PhD, studied post-mortem brains from 10 people with Parkinson’s and 14 without. They found HPgV in the post-mortem brains of five out of 10 people with Parkinson’s and none of the 14 control brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was also present in the spinal fluid of Parkinson’s patients, but not in the control group. Individuals with HPgV in their brains exhibited more advanced or distinct neuropathological changes, including increased tau pathology and altered levels of certain brain proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the blood analysis, researchers used samples from over 1,000 participants in the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative, which was launched by The Michael J. Fox Foundation and scientists to create a robust biosample library to help speed scientific breakthroughs and new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With the blood samples, we observed similar immune-related changes, mirroring those found in the brain,” Dr. Koralnik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who had the virus showed different signals from the immune system than those who didn’t, and this pattern was the same, no matter the genetics. But as we followed each person over time, we saw a more complicated picture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that in patients with a certain Parkinson’s-related gene mutation – LRRK2 – the signals from the immune system were different in response to the virus compared to Parkinson’s patients without the mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We plan to look more closely at how genes like LRRK2 affect the body’s response to other viral infections to figure out if this is a special effect of HPgV or a broader response to viruses,” added Dr. Koralnik.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the research team plans to study more people to find out how common the HPgV virus is in Parkinson’s patients and whether it plays a role in the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One big question we still need to answer is how often the virus gets into the brains of people with or without Parkinson’s,” said Dr. Koralnik.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also aim to understand how viruses and genes interact; insights that could reveal how Parkinson’s begins and could help guide future therapies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Parkinson’s Foundation, over one million people in the United States are living with Parkinson’s disease and 90,000 new cases are diagnosed every year. The number of people living with Parkinson’s disease is expected to rise to 1.2 million by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Parkinson’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.nm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mark Rudi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.nm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Mark Rudi – Northwestern University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.189988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Human pegivirus alters brain and blood immune and transcriptomic profiles of patients with Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;” by Igor Koralnik et al. &lt;em&gt;JCI Insight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human pegivirus alters brain and blood immune and transcriptomic profiles of patients with Parkinson’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with both genetic and environmental factors contributing to pathogenesis. Viral infections are potential environmental triggers that influence PD pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using ViroFind, an unbiased platform for whole virome sequencing, along with quantitative PCR (qPCR), we identified human pegivirus (HPgV) in 5 of 10 (50%) of PD brains, confirmed by IHC in 2 of 2 cases, suggesting an association with PD. All 14 age- and sex-matched controls were HPgV negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HPgV-brain positive patients with PD showed increased neuropathology by Braak stage and Complexin-2 levels, while those positive in the blood had higher IGF-1 and lower pS65-ubiquitin, supporting disruption in metabolism or mitophagy in response to HPgV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA-Seq revealed altered immune signaling in HPgV-infected PD samples, including consistent suppression of IL-4 signaling in both the brain and blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longitudinal analysis of blood samples showed a genotype-dependent viral response, with HPgV titers correlating directly with IL-4 signaling in a &lt;em&gt;LRRK2&lt;/em&gt; genotype–dependent manner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;YWHAB&lt;/em&gt; was a key hub gene in the &lt;em&gt;LRRK2&lt;/em&gt; genotypic response, which exhibited an altered relationship with immune-related factors, including &lt;em&gt;NFKB1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ITPR2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;LRRK2&lt;/em&gt; itself, in patients with PD who are positive for HPgV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest a role for HPgV in shaping PD pathology and highlight the complex interplay between viral infection, immunity, and neuropathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 17:19:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE45NC1pajUwV1BnNzR3a0pQWGZaQU1SR3hueVA1MkhkVkNBRm44N1JzcGhMMjcxTjUxcGhhWGxWLVIxVC1ob3EwQy1ocFV1MDY4UXlqdXltcml3SkwyaDVHLXJnZERRbEtW</guid></item><item><title>50岁后比健身房更快地重建失去的肌肉的5种每日锻炼-吃这个不是那个</title><link>https://www.eatthis.com/daily-exercises-rebuild-muscle-after-50/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content single-post-content"&gt;
										
					
					
					&lt;p&gt;Once you reach 30, your body starts to experience &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/habits-to-prevent-muscle-loss-in-your-50s/" target="_blank"&gt;sarcopenia&lt;/a&gt;, the natural loss of lean muscle. Adults can lose anywhere from &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3276215/" target="_blank"&gt;3% to 8% of muscle mass&lt;/a&gt; every decade, which can majorly impact strength and quality of life if you don’t take action. We’re here to help with five &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/daily-exercises-lift-tighten-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;daily exercises&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/daily-exercises-to-reverse-muscle-loss-after-45/" target="_blank"&gt;rebuild lost muscle&lt;/a&gt; quicker than the gym—especially after 50. Because, let’s be honest: Carving out gym time isn’t always feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main reasons for muscle loss with age is changes in hormone levels. “As these hormone levels decline, muscle regeneration slows down, and the body becomes less responsive to physical activity,” says &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/victoria-repa-115a1987/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Victoria Repa&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, certified Pilates instructor (The Australian Physiotherapy and Pilates Institute, APPI), health coach (Institute for Integrative Nutrition, IIN), and CEO and founder of &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://betterme.world/about" target="_blank"&gt;BetterMe&lt;/a&gt;. “As a result, you may notice that you need more time to recover after workouts, your strength stops increasing, and fat appears in place of muscle. Add to this a sedentary lifestyle, poor nutrition, or lack of strength training, and the loss becomes even more pronounced.”&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;That said, performing regular strength training and following a well-balanced nutrition plan can help you regain most of your lost muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Stronger muscles help improve balance, burn more calories at rest, maintain joint health, and prevent age-related issues. That’s why muscle recovery after 50 is one of the best investments you can make in your long-term health,” Repa tells us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;5 Daily Exercises That Rebuild Lost Muscle After 50&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discipline, consistency, and a wise selection of exercises are exactly what you need to build muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These five exercises can be done at home with dumbbells, for extra weight, and a mat,” Repa tells us. “They target the major muscle groups and can be adapted to any fitness level.”&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bent-Over Row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6gvmcqr226U?si=RVdIrYLusnrxoTqC" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This move targets the back, shoulders, arms and strengthens the posture muscles, which weaken with age,” Repa notes. “This is important in the fight against ‘tech neck’ and forward-leaning posture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall, feet hip-width apart and a dumbbell in each hand in front of you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hinge at the hips until your torso is parallel to the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain a flat back and soft knees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow the weights to lower with your arms completely extended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Row the dumbbells up toward your torso.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower to the start position with control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 3 sets of 10 to 12 reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p class="c-article__related-link"&gt;&lt;span class="c-article__related-link-inner"&gt;&lt;a class="related-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/best-exercises-for-women-over-45-longevity/" target="_blank"&gt; 8 Best Exercises for Women Over 45 To Live Longer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Overhead Dumbbell Press&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qGtDCtYeRQM?si=VecBIDJxbwoP4XB7" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exercise fires up the arms, upper back, and shoulders. “[It] strengthens [the] arm muscles, improves posture, and develops shoulder stability, which is especially important for women who suffer from bone density loss in the upper spine,” says Repa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder level, palms facing inward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press the weights overhead, extending your arms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use control to slowly lower the weights to shoulder height.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you have shoulder mobility issues, perform the exercise with each arm alternately or use lighter dumbbells,” Repa notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-article__related-link"&gt;&lt;span class="c-article__related-link-inner"&gt;&lt;a class="related-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/simple-exercises-build-muscle-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;4 Simple Exercises That Build More Muscle Than Weight Training After 50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bicep Curls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nkl8WnH6tDU?si=MioaU2yM5orV02P2" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell in each hand at your sides with a supinated grip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend your elbows to curl the weights up toward your shoulders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squeeze your biceps at the top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use control to lower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 2 to 3 sets of 12 to 15 reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p class="c-article__related-link"&gt;&lt;span class="c-article__related-link-inner"&gt;&lt;a class="related-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/bodyweight-fitness-easy-tests-after-45/" target="_blank"&gt;5 Easy Bodyweight Tests That Show Your Real Fitness After 45&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Romanian Deadlift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This move activates the glutes, lower back, and hamstrings.&lt;b&gt; “&lt;/b&gt;This exercise develops the strength of the posterior chain muscles, which improves walking and climbing stairs, and prevents injuries,” says Repa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall, feet hip-width apart, with a dumbbell in each hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend your knees slightly and hold the weights in front of your thighs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press your hips back as you lower the dumbbells down your leg. Maintain a straight back as you do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squeeze your glutes to return to the start position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p class="c-article__related-link"&gt;&lt;span class="c-article__related-link-inner"&gt;&lt;a class="related-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/home-exercises-build-muscle-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;5 Home Exercises That Build More Muscle Than Gym Workouts After 50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Calf Raises&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calf raises target your calves, ankles, and foot stability. “This move improves balance, ankle stability, and walking strength, which is especially important for preventing falls,” says Repa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall, feet hip-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rise onto your toes slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower back down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete 3 sets of 15 to 20 reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

More than 300 million people live with CAD, including 2.3 million in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It occurs when arteries in the heart become narrowed by a buildup of atheroma, a fatty material within their walls. The pain or discomfort felt from such narrowing is called angina and if a blockage occurs, it can cause a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The findings challenge the longstanding recommendation of aspirin as the default treatment for preventing serious cardiovascular events in hundreds of millions of CAD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;CAD often requires lifelong treatment to prevent heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular death. Aspirin has traditionally been prescribed indefinitely for patients with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, the evidence supporting aspirin’s long-term benefits and safety has been limited. The new analysis of seven clinical trials found that patients taking clopidogrel had a 14% lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events – including heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death – compared with those taking aspirin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Importantly, the rates of major bleeding issues in patients were similar between the two drugs, dispelling concerns that clopidogrel might lead to more bleeding complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Writing in the Lancet, the study team said: “This comprehensive synthesis of available evidence indicates that, in patients with CAD, long-term clopidogrel monotherapy offers superior protection against major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events compared with aspirin, without an excess risk of bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="248e6beb-eebe-49f9-abb5-ad58936a34a3" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":14,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Potassium-rich diet may cut risk of heart failure by 24%, study suggests","elementId":"248e6beb-eebe-49f9-abb5-ad58936a34a3","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/29/potassium-rich-diet-may-cut-risk-of-heart-failure-by-24-per-cent-study"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The superior efficacy of clopidogrel v aspirin was consistent across multiple key subgroups, including individuals with clinical features predictive of poor clopidogrel responsiveness, supporting the generalisability of these findings to the broad spectrum of patients with CAD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“These results support a preference for clopidogrel over aspirin for chronic antiplatelet monotherapy for patients with stable CAD. The widespread availability, generic formulation and affordability of clopidogrel further supports its potential for extensive adoption in clinical practice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The analysis drew from diverse patient groups, including those who had undergone procedures such as stent placement or had experienced acute coronary syndrome, and examined various subgroups to ensure the findings applied broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Notably, even patients who might respond less well to clopidogrel as a result of genetic or clinical factors still benefited from its use over aspirin. The results suggest that clopidogrel should be considered the preferred long-term anti-platelet medication for patients with CAD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Because both medications are widely available, the findings have the potential to influence clinical guidelines worldwide and improve patient outcomes. Further research on the cost-effectiveness of clopidogrel, as well as broader population studies, will be needed to support changes in treatment standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Bryan Williams, the chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation, said: “Aspirin is a commonly prescribed drug to help prevent repeat heart attacks and strokes. This research suggests that clopidogrel, an alternative to aspirin, might be more effective at preventing recurrent heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Importantly, these benefits come without a greater risk of major bleeding. These findings are likely to impact the medications doctors prescribe to their patients to reduce their risk of future heart problems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 16:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgFBVV95cUxPUFI0cGtua0d5VDlHal9MSF9VTFA5dHBtQTl4TUE4WTA1VF9sdkZIRHBMY3Q1ODZqU2pxYm9BanZ1ZkoweXRZNExyZ1BaZ3hKZDY0akFXbEJ0LXUxRVg2M1BxYk4tZGZudzMxYnFoUi1UQVQ1MVRiUTQ3ekY0UWxIZEcwY2RVU005TlhoYkNfX29iOHkzNFktWnJGMFM5WE5menhvVlYwWWFTZV9PcTI4MVhUR1Bad0RMYl9Qc1R2Q2QyMjNMVEdEZTU0aTVCZw</guid></item><item><title>将阿司匹林转换为替代药物“降低心脏病发作的风险” -泰晤士报</title><link>https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/asperin-clopidogrel-heart-disease-bbzffpzt5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__ArticleContent-sc-15gvuj2-8 kuowVf"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Millions of Britons who take aspirin to lower their risk of heart attacks and strokes would see an even greater benefit by switching to an alternative drug, scientists suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;People diagnosed with coronary heart disease are usually advised to take a &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/who-should-be-taking-aspirin-and-why-mkw797055" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;daily aspirin&lt;/a&gt; to thin their blood and cut their risk of suffering a serious cardiac event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Now, a review has found switching to an alternative blood thinner, clopidogrel, reduces the risk of heart attack, stroke or death by an extra 14 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The global research team, including scientists from Imperial College London, concluded that the alternative drug offered more protection and that there was a strong case to adjust recommendations to make clopidogrel the preferred option for patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Their findings were published in&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; The Lancet medical journal and presented at the European Society of Cardiology congress in Madrid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Coronary artery disease, or coronary heart disease, is the most commonly diagnosed type of heart disease and affects 2.3 million people in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/heart-disease-cardiologist-advice-avoid-prevention-37hkkqxwm" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The ten ways cardiologists avoid heart disease&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;It occurs when arteries in the heart become narrowed by a build-up of atheroma, a fatty material within their walls.

So if you're looking for how to lower cholesterol naturally to avoid these conditions, you're making a smart choice for your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important to remember, though, that your body does need &lt;em&gt;some &lt;/em&gt;cholesterol. Per the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/23922-what-is-cholesterol" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, cholesterol is a waxy, fatty substance found in your cells. Your liver makes it naturally, but it’s also found in animal products like meat and dairy. Cholesterol is responsible for building cell membranes, helping your liver make bile, and assisting in the production of hormones. However, getting more than you need—which can happen from eating too many cholesterol-rich foods—causes plaque to form in the arteries, which &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ldlthebadcholesterol.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:could lead;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;could lead&lt;/a&gt; to dangerous blood flow blockages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;a href="http://www.arkmedicalcenter.com/portfolio/omar-ali-md-facc/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Omar Ali, M.D., F.A.C.C.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Omar Ali, M.D., F.A.C.C.&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified interventional cardiologist at ARK Medical Center in Michigan; &lt;a href="https://www.columbiadoctors.org/jennifer-h-haythe-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jennifer Haythe, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jennifer Haythe, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of cardiology and director of the cardio-obstetrics program at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, discover what healthy cholesterol levels look like, plus the best expert-approved foods to lower cholesterol naturally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What do healthy cholesterol numbers look like?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two types of cholesterol in the body: LDL (or “bad”) cholesterol and HDL (or “good”) cholesterol. In general, you should limit LDL as much as you can, hopefully replacing it with HDL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LDL cholesterol is the main culprit behind buildup and blockage in the arteries, per the &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/cholesterollevelswhatyouneedtoknow.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Library of Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; (NLM), while HDL actually helps remove LDL. Cholesterol is measured in milligrams per deciliter of blood, abbreviated as mg/dL. Ideally, this is what healthy cholesterol numbers look like, according to the NLM:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women over age 20:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total cholesterol: 125 to 200 mg/dL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;LDL cholesterol: Less than 100 mg/dL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;HDL cholesterol: 50 mg/dL or higher&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Men over age 20:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total cholesterol: 125 to 200 mg/dL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;LDL cholesterol: Less than 100 mg/dL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;HDL cholesterol: 40 mg/dL or higher&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medications like statins can help you get to healthy levels, though most experts recommend trying to make healthy lifestyle changes first. “I always advise people to try and lower their cholesterol through diet and exercise,” said &lt;a href="https://www.columbiadoctors.org/jennifer-h-haythe-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jennifer Haythe, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jennifer Haythe, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of cardiology and director of the cardio-obstetrics program at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lowering your cholesterol without medication is possible, but it'll take some work. One of the most beneficial changes is simply getting more active. “To reduce cholesterol, it’s essential to start a cardiovascular fitness routine that involves moderately vigorous exercise four times per week,” Dr. Haythe said. You can start with moderate exercises, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/a20485587/benefits-from-walking-every-day/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:like walking;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;like walking&lt;/a&gt;, for 15 to 20 minutes a day, building up from there. (And if you smoke, you should try to stop as soon as you can.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating a nutrient-rich diet is also crucial. Cutting back on high-cholesterol foods—like fried foods, sugary desserts, and fatty meats—is a start, but you should also eat more of the fare that can actually help lower your cholesterol. Fans of the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/diets/a30326160/mediterranean-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; should be pleased; its staples are naturally low in LDL cholesterol and can actively remove it from your system. Here, you’ll find the best picks to add to your grocery list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best foods to lower cholesterol naturally&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole grains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting 5 to 10 grams of soluble fiber (found in whole grains like oats and brown rice) daily could help lower LDL cholesterol, per the &lt;a href="https://www.lipid.org/sites/default/files/adding_soluble_fiber_final_0.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Lipid Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Lipid Association&lt;/a&gt;. Because you digest fiber slowly, it’s able to bind to cholesterol in the blood and remove it from the body, Dr. Haythe explained. Cooked oats are a top source, offering &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/173905/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2 grams;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2 grams&lt;/a&gt; of soluble fiber per half-cup serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it&lt;/strong&gt;: These &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/recipes/a23570617/apple-oatmeal-muffins-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:apple oatmeal muffins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;apple oatmeal muffins&lt;/a&gt; include a half-serving of oats each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fatty fish&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aim to eat at least two 3.5-ounce servings of fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, tuna, trout, or herring per week, according the &lt;a href="http://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/fish-and-omega-3-fatty-acids" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Heart Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;.

Beta blockers have been the standard treatment for these patients for 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a breakthrough discovery from the “REBOOT Trial” with senior investigator Valentin Fuster, MD, PhD, President of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital and General Director of Spain’s Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC). The study results, which could overturn a standard treatment paradigm, were presented on Saturday, August 30, during a “Hot Line” session at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Madrid, and simultaneously published in &lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additionally, a REBOOT substudy, published on August 30 in the &lt;em&gt;European Heart Journal,&lt;/em&gt; shows that women treated with beta blockers had a higher risk of death, heart attack, or hospitalization for heart failure compared to women not receiving the drug. Men did not have this increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This trial will reshape all international clinical guidelines. It joins other previous landmark trials led by CNIC and Mount Sinai—such as SECURE with the polypill and DapaTAVI, with SLT2 inhibition associated to TAVI—that have already transformed some global approaches to cardiovascular disease,” says Dr. Fuster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SECURE trial showed a polypill, a single pill that that combines three medications - which contains aspirin, ramipril, and atorvastatin – reduces cardiovascular events by 33 percent in patients treated with this after a heart attack. The DapaTAVI trial showed both dapagliflozin and the related medication empagliflozin - drugs used to treat diabetes- improves the prognosis of patients with aortic stenosis treated by transcatheter aortic valve implantation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“REBOOT will change clinical practice worldwide,” says Principal Investigator Borja Ibáñez, MD, CNIC’s Scientific Director, who presented the results. “Currently, more than 80 percent of patients with uncomplicated myocardial infarction are discharged on beta blockers. The REBOOT findings represent one of the most significant advances in heart attack treatment in decades.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although generally considered safe, beta blockers can cause side effects such as fatigue, bradycardia (low heart rate), and sexual dysfunction. For more than 40 years, beta blockers have been prescribed as a standard treatment after a heart attack, but their benefit in the context of modern treatments was unproven. The REBOOT trial, is the largest clinical trial on this subject. The international study was coordinated by CNIC in collaboration with the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers enrolled 8,505 patients across 109 hospitals in Spain and Italy. Participants were randomly assigned to receive or not receive beta blockers after hospital discharge. All patients otherwise received the current standard of care and were followed for a median of nearly four years. The results showed no significant differences between the two groups in rates of death, recurrent heart attack, or hospitalization for heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A REBOOT subgroup analysis found that women treated with beta blockers experienced more adverse events. Results show women treated with beta-blockers had a 2.7 percent higher absolute risk of mortality compared to those not treated with beta-blockers during the 3.7 years of follow-up of the study. The elevated risk when treated with beta-blockers was restricted to women with a complete normal cardiac function after a heart attack (left ventricular ejection fraction of 50 percent or higher). Those with a mild deterioration in cardiac function did not have an excess risk of adverse outcomes when treated with beta-blockers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After a heart attack, patients are typically prescribed multiple medications, which can make adherence difficult,” explains Dr. Ibáñez. “Beta blockers were added to standard treatment early on because they significantly reduced mortality at the time. Their benefits were linked to reduced cardiac oxygen demand and arrhythmia prevention. But therapies have evolved. Today, occluded coronary arteries are reopened rapidly and systematically, drastically lowering the risk of serious complications such as arrhythmias. In this new context—where the extent of heart damage is smaller—the need for beta blockers is unclear. While we often test new drugs, it's much less common to rigorously question the continued need for older treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the motivation behind REBOOT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The trial was designed to optimize heart attack care based on solid scientific evidence and without commercial interests. These results will help streamline treatment, reduce side effects, and improve quality of life for thousands of patients every year,” Dr. Ibanez adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REBOOT was conducted without pharmaceutical industry funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
