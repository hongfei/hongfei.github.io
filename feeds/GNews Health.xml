  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="17" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqnwhuo001b3b76u02k99ou@published"&gt;My wife and I attended a sex party recently to find a new addition to our group.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqoeyoi004n3b76j2r1sxah@published"&gt;One of the regulars, “Annie,” arrived with “Clay,” whom she met at the sex club we all frequent, and said he had brought a “big surprise.” That was an understatement. Clay was packing a nine-inch penis. Suffice it to say, all the women made sure he was properly “welcomed” into our social circle. Ever since then, I have been incredibly depressed. I can’t imagine how I’m ever going to satisfy my wife again. I’m not small, I would say I’m average, but how can I possibly compete with something like that?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqnwi1t001f3b76lfp5ux0u@published"&gt;Do you believe your wife when she tells you things? I ask because an alarming number of men don’t believe women when they express their preferences, especially when those preferences are at odds with men’s own ideals or ideas about what women want. The &lt;a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/dad-bod-body-image-trends-olly-murs-b1224933.html"&gt;recent controversy surrounding William Costello’s poll about Olly Murs’ shifting body&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.wehuntedthemammoth.com/2025/05/02/why-men-get-furious-at-women-who-say-they-prefer-the-dad-bod/"&gt;the many men who then accused female poll respondents of lying&lt;/a&gt;, are stark examples of the way that straight men can struggle with squaring their own expectations and the realities of women’s tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="136" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqnwi41001g3b76k4oxkuhu@published"&gt;If you don’t generally believe your wife, you’ve got a whole other, larger issue. But if you do, share your insecurities with her. Keep in mind that whole infants often pass through people’s vaginal canals, and after birth, those people are still able to enjoy penetrative sex. Remember that bigger—especially longer—often means battering of the cervix, which can make a large penis less attractive in the context of a committed relationship than in the context of a one-off at a sex party. And there’s so much more to sex than the in-and-out of it, at least as far as what women generally find enjoyable. With those facts in your mind as a baseline, listen to what your wife has to say in response to how you’re feeling. Internalize the reassurance she is likely to offer you.&lt;/p&gt;

You are, I’m certain, far more than a life support system for a fleshy, self-driving dildo. If you’re still struggling after taking all of these steps, therapy may be in order. Depression is serious, and if you’re experiencing enough symptoms of it to describe yourself as “incredibly depressed” in response to this one incident, it’s quite possible that there are more factors at play that a professional will be well-positioned to help you address.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="127" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqnxhdy001q3b76mbtpcafq@published"&gt;My girlfriend “Anabel” has been having a problem for a couple of months now. Sometimes when we are having sex, it will feel like she’s about to orgasm and then her pussy will suddenly squeeze my dick so hard it’s painful. I lose my erection and have to wait in near-agony until she unclenches to get out. This has only happened a handful of times, but it’s VERY unpleasant when it does. Anabel is not at all happy about this, but says she doesn’t know how to distinguish between whether she is going to come or clamp up. It’s beginning to affect our love life because, as you can imagine, I am more than a little reluctant to take the risk. What can be done about this?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqnxhdz001t3b76jiuexpuk@published"&gt;An in-person exam from a pelvic floor therapist is ideal here. Absolutely do not, under any circumstances, encourage Anabel to search up various exercises and try them without professional guidance. It can do more harm than good. Keep in mind that the choice to see a medical professional is Anabel’s at the end of the day, but if she’s open to the idea, you can help by searching for local providers.&lt;/p&gt;

I have had an erratic work schedule for the past five months, and because of this, he claims he has to resort to self-pleasure since I’m never around when he wants sex. There have been plenty of times when I’ve tried to initiate, but he turns me down because (surprise!) it’s been less than an hour since he smacked it. At this point, I’m beginning to wonder if he even truly needs me at all—I can count the number of times we’ve had sex in the last couple of months on one hand without using all my fingers. Should I try and repair the connection that we used to have, or is he sending me a not-so-subtle message that our time together is over?&lt;/p&gt;

                A vaccine pharmacist prepares samples as part of an HIV vaccine trial on March 16, 2022 in Masaka, Uganda. The vaccine in that trial did not prove effective. A promising vaccine development program funded by the National Institutes of Health was just informed by the Trump administration that its support will end next year.

   &lt;p&gt;For nearly 15 years, Dennis Burton worked on a project aimed at solving what he calls "one of the most difficult problems in biomedicine" — creating an HIV vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That work was funded by the largest National Institutes of Health-funded program devoted to such research, with a seven-year grant totaling $258 million, and is considered one of the leading vaccine efforts. On May 30, he learned that work will end. In a video call, NIH officials told him that the Trump administration was terminating the program next year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's just devastating. So much human toil has gone into this," says the Scripps Research Institute immunologist. "Just when it looked like we could beat this virus, we're going to give up."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Designing an effective HIV vaccine has proven &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/04/26/179231916/failure-of-latest-hiv-vaccine-test-a-huge-disappointment" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;immensely challenging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for researchers, who've spent decades working to figure out how to prompt the immune system to protect against this wily virus, says &lt;a href="https://www.scripps.edu/faculty/burton/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Burton&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of the reasons it's so difficult is because the HIV virus evolves faster than any other known virus. Even within an infected individual, the virus can splinter off into many new variants, effectively dodging the immune system's first-responders — antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Burton and his colleagues at the &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/chavi-id" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Development&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — a consortia of researchers at Scripps and Duke University known as CHAVD — have been working on a promising approach aimed at coaxing the immune system to make "broadly neutralizing antibodies" capable of attacking many forms of the virus. Clinical trials were slated to start as soon as next year. Without funding, they won't proceed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Complex and duplicative health programs have resulted in serious duplication of efforts that dilute taxpayer resources," a Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson told NPR in response to a question about the rationale behind the cuts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The news of the termination comes as the HIV vaccine has largely coalesced around the idea that broadly neutralizing antibodies are central to an effective HIV vaccine, says &lt;a href="https://www.iavi.org/person/mark-feinberg/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mark Feinberg&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, president and CEO of IAVI, a non-profit that develops vaccines. Scripps and Duke researchers were pursuing different approaches toward that shared goal, which is good, he says. "You don't know which is going to work and whether there's potential synergies between the two approaches."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration's termination of CHAVD is just the latest in a string of cuts and cancellations of HIV-vaccine related grants, from clinical trials to basic laboratory research. In 2022, the U.S. accounted for &lt;a href="https://avac.org/resource/infographic/top-vaccines-funders/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;nearly 90%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the $731 million devoted to HIV vaccine research globally. If those funds dry up, many researchers fear that the prospects of getting an effective HIV vaccine will dwindle.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"After many years of frustration and negative results we now believe that there is a pathway to develop an efficacious HIV vaccine," says Feinberg. "It's really disappointing at this time to have the foundation kicked out from underneath you."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A canceled African trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The NIH-funded project isn't the only vaccine research being affected by the Trump administration. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In late January, biomedical scientist &lt;a href="https://idm.uct.ac.za/contacts/linda-gail-bekker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Linda-Gail Bekker&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and her colleagues were gathered in Tanzania to discuss their efforts to develop and test HIV vaccines across eight African countries. That team, called &lt;a href="https://africanalliance.org.za/brilliant-consortium-shut-down-home-page/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The BRILLIANT HIV vaccine consortium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had won a five-year $45 million dollar grant from USAID in 2023 and was days away from starting its first clinical trial in humans when it got a stop-work order from the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"To say we were disappointed is to completely underplay how we felt," said Bekker, of the University of Cape Town. "We felt desperate, that something we'd been working so hard to accomplish was removed without a good reason."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bekker and her colleagues had spent a year assembling a team of research biologists and clinicians from around the world to develop immunogens — substances that kick start an immune response that serve as the basis for future vaccines. They looked for inspiration, in part, from HIV patients in South Africa whose bodies seem to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/12/12/786811843/a-new-hiv-vaccine-effort-with-a-different-kind-of-strategy" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;naturally produce&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; broadly neutralizing antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The idea was to base [vaccines] on [HIV] viruses that had been discovered in Africa and immunogens designed based on those viruses as templates," she said. Underscoring the global nature of HIV vaccine research, scientists with the CHAVD program helped design some of the immunogens, Bekker says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Then, the team would "put these immunogens into humans, in clinical trials, to test whether we can actually move the human immune system to make broadly neutralizing antibodies," says Bekker. Those clinical trials were slated to happen in African countries where the HIV epidemic is most severe, allowing researchers to more clearly assess whether the vaccines work than if they were to test them in, say, the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, Bekker and her colleagues have largely stopped vaccine-related work and are instead scrambling to find alternative funds for the project.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The USAID grant is "irreplaceable" in terms of its scope, says Bekker. The team is now figuring out how to scale back their ambitions by running fewer, smaller clinical trials. But that means the data will be less valuable, says Bekker.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These kinds of international collaborations are commonplace in efforts to develop and test HIV vaccines, researchers told NPR — and face an uncertain future under the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In May, NIH announced it would &lt;a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-25-104.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;no longer fund&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; foreign "subawards," which allow U.S. scientists to pay foreign collaborators to conduct research overseas. Last year, NIH funded more than 3,600 such awards. Instead, foreign researchers must apply directly to NIH for funding, a barrier that will likely reduce foreign collaboration, says &lt;a href="https://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/zolla-paznerlab/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Susan Zolla-Pazner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a microbiologist at the Ichan School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Foreign partners in HIV research are extremely important," she says. "It's a global disease and viruses don't recognize national boundaries." For example, if a researcher wanted to study how to prevent babies from being infected by their HIV-positive mothers, the best thing to do is conduct the study in a place where such mothers exist in sufficient numbers, which is outside of the U.S. says Zolla-Pazner. If you can't do that, "it's more than a hurdle. It's a brick wall in terms of being able to understand how to protect a population of women and their children."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;On top of these restrictions, researchers worry generally about the prospect of getting vaccine-related grants accepted in the current climate. NIH has already cancelled or delayed payments on over 2,500 individual grants, including some related to HIV vaccine research, and under the Trump administration has&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/28/nx-s1-5414642/trump-vaccine-bird-flu-mrna" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; signaled a shift away&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from mRNA vaccine research — the same platform that allowed rapid development of the first COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pessimism — and yet hope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Altogether, the administration's actions — and &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/fy-2026-budget-in-brief.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;pledges to cut funding&lt;/a&gt; for NIH grants by more than 40% next year — have many researchers pessimistic about the prospects of developing an HIV vaccine anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"My personal view is that advances will stall out," says Burton, the Scripps scientist. "The United States led the world in HIV vaccine research, I don't think that anyone's going to step into the breach," he says. "Philanthropy can certainly help, but they're unlikely to step in with the magnitude of funding needed."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even if funding eventually comes back, from the U.S. or elsewhere, it can be difficult for research groups to bounce back from extended cuts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It is putting a period in the middle of a sentence," says Zolla-Pazner. "You cannot reconstitute that group, even two months later, because people have lost their jobs."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Other researchers are hopeful the field will eventually build on the progress already made to deliver an HIV vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It remains a huge challenge, but we now have little chinks of light of how to move this field forward," says Bekker. "I believe we will get back on track, but we will have lost time," she says. "And that means people's lives."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have information you want to share about the ongoing changes at federal science agencies and their effects on research?

During roughly an eight-year period, 90.3 percent of exercisers survived compared with 83.2 percent of those who were in a general health education program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XWM5VBIQKBB23JE7XSGXZ6PZJE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;We asked experts what people should know about this new research and how people who’ve had cancer — especially those who might still be experiencing fatigue, nausea and other side effects from treatment — can reap the potential benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="QIQYNUKUQVAGBLQKEW3K7GUA3Y" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="QIQYNUKUQVAGBLQKEW3K7GUA3Y" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;How much exercise is beneficial?&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5B2RCM4VWNHT7MYMEGUPXI4SS4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the new study, researchers didn’t just tell patients to exercise. People with Stage 2 or Stage 3 colon cancer (who had already completed surgery and chemotherapy two to six months earlier, and also passed a treadmill test) were given a structured exercise program that pushed them to reach certain exertion targets, almost as if they were in physical therapy. That made a difference, noted &lt;a href="https://radonc.utoronto.ca/faculty/rebecca-wong" target="_blank"&gt;Rebecca Wong&lt;/a&gt;, a professor in the radiation oncology department at the University of Toronto and a co-author of the study, because it provided motivation and goals that enabled people to stick with exercise over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YHS7N3DOPNGL7DMFP3MP3EHDJM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In all, 445 people were put on the structured exercise program for three years and another 444 patients were simply advised that exercise would help their prognosis. In the structured program, people hit their targets mainly by brisk walking, which is considered moderate intensity activity, though some were able to do higher-intensity activities such as jogging, swimming, biking, playing pickleball or tennis. But the benefit isn’t just from having a structured regimen, Wong said. It’s having one you stick with for the long haul. “It’s a lifestyle change,” Wong said. “It’s not so much, do this for three years and you can go back and sit on the couch.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NSBREXYCJRFS7OHTSHEXDMSEZU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And the reduced risk was not just for colon cancer. Patients in the structured exercise group also were less likely to develop new primary cancers, indicating there is potentially a protective effect for other cancers as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="4KJTPNIK3RHTFCY57YUJDEN5XI" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="4KJTPNIK3RHTFCY57YUJDEN5XI" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;How should cancer patients exercise?&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PUVGEZLYSVEHZHZZAVKWM5GIK4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For cancer survivors, the&lt;a href="https://www.exerciseismedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EIM_Rx-for-Health_Cancer.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; American College of Sports Medicine recommends&lt;/a&gt; starting slowly and building up to at least 150 minutes of aerobic activity a week, either moderate-intensity activity such as walking, light cycling, yoga, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2024/how-to-start-tai-chi/" target="_blank"&gt;tai chi&lt;/a&gt; or water exercise, or 75 minutes a week of vigorous activity such as brisk walking, singles tennis or hiking hills — or a combination of both. They also recommend some strength and resistance exercises such as weight training two to three times per week, suggesting 6 to 15 reps using weights, resistance bands, weight machines or your own body, doing things such as kitchen counter &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/05/10/no-more-girl-push-ups/" target="_blank"&gt;push-ups&lt;/a&gt; or chair squats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7FMKRD5R7RBQ5NZBFDHO5YA6IY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Of course, if you have cancer or have recently completed treatment, the last thing you might want to hear is that you need to work out. Given how physically arduous cancer treatment can be, it’s important to note that the new study was conducted in patients who had completed active treatment for their colon cancer, said &lt;a href="https://medicine.med.ubc.ca/sharlene-gill/" target="_blank"&gt;Sharlene Gill&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of medicine at the University of British Columbia and a co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QJ5EYSBD6VDYJGUDX6CEFJKVRU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The findings “can’t be extrapolated to those patients who are on active treatment and are managing symptoms and side effects, but we believe there would be a quality of life benefit,” Gill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UUGY4HCLGVHQXGYKCYQGPKFGVQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For those people, exercise needs to be matched with capacity. The “general rule is that any activity is better than no activity, and it should be moderate but not intense,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PGC764A4FJF4ZAXSFQH7BM2FPM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some say their fatigue is not too bad in the morning so they can try to exercise early in the day, while others say nausea is worse after they eat so they can try to exercise before they eat, Courneya said. If pain or nausea are too severe, they should rest. But he added that exercise has been shown to help with these symptoms, especially fatigue and pain, so if possible, patients could try to push through it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IZD6CBWJCNG5HO62EDBANWQMWE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Patients will need to judge their own side effects and work around them,” Courneya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="25GMMQHPSNCTRL2HE5NAZD4WHI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We recommend that patients undergoing treatment do activity as they are able, but definitely acknowledging the challenges, especially around the time of treatments,” &lt;a href="https://hospital.uillinois.edu/find-a-doctor/deborah-manst" target="_blank"&gt;Deborah Manst&lt;/a&gt;, an oncogeneralist at the University of Illinois Cancer Center and a clinical assistant professor in family and community medicine, wrote in an email.

Each of the four gummies this patient took, however, contained 10 milligrams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZML3PZ5MKVHH7KYSCHBL2XLYNQ"&gt;The woman started experiencing intense anxiety and heart palpitations. A young person might have shrugged off such symptoms, but this patient had high blood pressure and atrial fibrillation, a heart arrhythmia.

Her only lingering symptom was embarrassment, Han said. But what if she’d grown dizzy or lightheaded and was hurt in a fall? He said he has had patients injured in falls or while driving after using cannabis. What if the cannabis had interacted with the prescription drugs she took?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ODOWKE6JGBFADNY7GZLEWCVGJA"&gt;“As a geriatrician, it gives me pause,” Han said. “Our brains are more sensitive to psychoactive substances as we age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NIUKGXWUERBJXADXEATVDY5HL4"&gt;Thirty-nine states and the District of Columbia now &lt;a href="https://www.ncsl.org/health/state-medical-cannabis-laws" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;allow cannabis use&lt;/a&gt; for medical reasons, and in 24 of those states, as well as the district, &lt;a href="https://covercannabis.com/blog/where-is-marijuana-legal/#:~:text=Which%20States%20Have%20Legalized%20Recreational,nearly%20half%20of%20the%20country." target="_blank" rel=""&gt;recreational use&lt;/a&gt; is also legal. As older adults’ use climbs, “the benefits are still unclear,” Han said. “But we’re seeing more evidence of potential harms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AT267ZY37JHLNALGHEPRUFQBQE"&gt;A wave of recent research points to reasons for concern for older users, with cannabis-related emergency room visits and hospitalizations rising, and a Canadian study finding an association between such acute care and subsequent dementia. Older people are more apt than younger ones to try cannabis for therapeutic reasons: to relieve chronic pain, insomnia, or mental health issues, though evidence of its effectiveness in addressing those conditions remains thin, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AE4FMQHRSFDKVOWXR7NZKGP36E"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.1156?guestAccessKey=6fb7097a-4590-4b78-b8a5-b21f5b00def4&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=060225" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;analysis of national survey data&lt;/a&gt; published June 2 in the medical journal JAMA, Han and his colleagues reported that “current” cannabis use (defined as use within the previous month) had jumped among adults age 65 or older to 7% of respondents in 2023, from 4.8% in 2021. In 2005, he pointed out, fewer than 1% of older adults reported using cannabis in the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JMHCWYER3BHPBCBJZVAB7VMPFU"&gt;What’s driving the increase? Experts cite the steady march of state legalization — use by older people is highest in those states — while surveys show that the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8440375/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;perceived risk&lt;/a&gt; of cannabis use has declined. One national survey found that a growing &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37566411/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;proportion of American adults — 44% in 2021 — erroneously thought&lt;/a&gt; it safer to smoke cannabis daily than cigarettes. The authors of the study, in JAMA Network Open, noted that “these views do not reflect the existing science on cannabis and tobacco smoke.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XI3CMXJHDRHM3IZOF3P6G2IFEU"&gt;The cannabis industry also markets its products to older adults. The Trulieve chain gives a 10% discount, both in stores and online, to those it calls “wisdom” customers, 55 or older. Rise Dispensaries ran a yearlong cannabis education and empowerment program for two senior centers in Paterson, New Jersey, including field trips to its dispensary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HAWFBROG7NE7JABDVID4ULFBUQ"&gt;The industry has many satisfied older customers. Liz Logan, 67, a freelance writer in Bronxville, New York, had grappled with sleep problems and anxiety for years, but the conditions grew particularly debilitating two years ago, as her husband was dying of Parkinson’s disease. “I’d frequently be awake until 5 or 6 in the morning,” she said. “It makes you crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CYYPYKBI6VDPNOV7RYEMY2QM2Y"&gt;Looking online for edible cannabis products, Logan found that gummies containing cannabidiol, known as CBD, alone didn’t help, but those with 10 milligrams of THC did the trick without noticeable side effects. “I don’t worry about sleep anymore,” she said. “I’ve solved a lifelong problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7LB5NICPCFHAFJ3HVTEB5KQUQM"&gt;But studies in the United States and Canada, which &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/programs/engaging-cannabis-legalization-regulation-canada-taking-stock-progress/document.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;legalized nonmedical cannabis&lt;/a&gt; use for adults nationally in 2018, show climbing rates of cannabis-related health care use among older people, both in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2820100" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;outpatient settings&lt;/a&gt; and in hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FR5MHFXLNVAYZDOYRTCDVAW7DM"&gt;In California, for instance, cannabis-related &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36622838/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;emergency room visits&lt;/a&gt; by those 65 or older rose, to 395 per 100,000 visits in 2019 from about 21 in 2005. In Ontario, acute care (meaning emergency visits or hospital admissions) resulting from cannabis use increased fivefold in middle-aged adults from 2008 to 2021, and more than &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40227745/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;26 times among those 65 and up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17" data-gaid="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7TTMFLUYOBFCDPFQ6L5ELNUSKU"&gt;“It’s not reflective of everyone who’s using cannabis,” cautioned Daniel Myran, an investigator at the Bruyère Health Research Institute in Ottawa and lead author of the Ontario study. “It’s capturing people with more severe patterns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18" data-gaid="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HL3L3JVJLVHIRLFSQ6Z2T5CPOY"&gt;But since other studies have shown &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39112780/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;increased cardiac risk&lt;/a&gt; among some cannabis users with heart disease or diabetes, “there’s a number of warning signals,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-19" data-gaid="inarticle-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GBTNKUTFMBBX3FFCUIKOHAGMFI"&gt;For example, a disturbing proportion of older veterans who currently use cannabis &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2833976" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;screen positive for cannabis use disorder&lt;/a&gt;, a recent JAMA Network Open study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-20" data-gaid="inarticle-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XXJ476VTZZCKJLZPCEW5TW36IM"&gt;As with other substance use disorders, such patients “can tolerate high amounts,” said the lead author, Vira Pravosud, a cannabis researcher at the Northern California Institute for Research and Education. “They continue using even if it interferes with their social or work or family obligations” and may experience withdrawal if they stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-21" data-gaid="inarticle-21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="K4JHPVPOOFFVTBHXKGUVHEJKYE"&gt;Among 4,500 older veterans (with an average age of 73) seeking care at Department of Veterans Affairs health facilities, &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250519/Study-reveals-high-rates-of-cannabis-use-disorder-in-older-US-veterans.aspx" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;researchers found&lt;/a&gt; that more than 10% had reported cannabis use within the previous 30 days. Of those, 36% fit the criteria for mild, moderate, or severe &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9590423/#:~:text=DSM-5%20CUD%20criteria%20include,6)%20social%2C%20occupational%2C%20or" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;cannabis use disorder&lt;/a&gt;, as established in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-22" data-gaid="inarticle-22"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UMKKX7XOZNBQTFOEWUDJ2LUK4E"&gt;VA patients differ from the general population, Pravosud noted.

ROACH: I am a 53-year-old healthy male, and I always request to check my PSA levels each year. My 57-year-old brother’s new doctor denied his request for a routine PSA check on their initial visit. She said that the test now produces more false positives and unnecessary procedures and surgeries, so she said “no” and wouldn’t order it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZB53QQL44VBA3PBJEDIVEHXSBE"&gt;Are primary care physicians discouraging the PSA test for older men now? I don’t get any push back when I request to check it. Also, I heard the digital rectal exam (DRE) isn’t as valid anymore for screening. His new doctor also did not do a DRE. I’m curious to know your thoughts are on the current DRE and PSA screening guidelines for primary care physicians? -- C.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="A3OQMXJRURDKHPYEQXYU4RO6XA"&gt;ANSWER: The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test is a screening blood test for cancer, and the recommendation for its use has gone back and forth over decades since it’s been introduced. Since screening and prevention are my areas of expertise, I have followed the literature on the use of PSA and other screening tests very closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XOPHZZ3LMVFPNDNOADQWDYIC7U"&gt;In my opinion, your brother’s doctor was wrong to refuse to order the test. She was right that it does produce false positives, which could potentially lead to unnecessary surgeries; however, there are good ways to reduce unnecessary treatment while still ordering the test, which can save lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MFT4O75NHJEPHISGF6VZNNOMCU"&gt;Most prostate cancer is so slow-growing that it is likely never to bother a man until he dies from something else. So, we don’t want to operate on these relatively indolent cancers because there’s a possibility of a serious side effect from surgery, such as urinary incontinence or erectile dysfunction (neither of which any man wants).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4FMYJDOYKVFQZHYOFGYPY64DSU"&gt;Before operating, careful testing is done on the prostate cancer, including imaging (ideally by MRI scan), biopsy with pathological examination, and often genetic testing of the tumor. Along with the PSA results, we can separate prostate cancer into categories of very low risk and low risk versus intermediate and high risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ENRBLA2BRJGI7C3G2MHHESN5JM"&gt;Once we have the diagnosis, we can make good recommendations so that we can identify the rare high-risk cancers while not unnecessarily treating the low-risk cancers. Without screenings, we can’t keep rare, small and aggressive tumors from spreading until it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CNCPY75Y6RDHDPAQ4PT5KYGYBY"&gt;Now I have to tell you that age 53 and 57 isn’t so much “older,” at least from the perspective of prostate cancer screening. The most important time for prostate cancer screening is age 50 to age 70. There are some men who may benefit from starting screening at a younger age (those with a family history, Black men, and men with certain genetic risks) and some who benefit from starting screening when they’re older than 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QI7YTF5ML5FMVCQ57BUGI3XZSQ"&gt;The DRE does not add much to the blood test. Approximately 1% of men will get prostate cancer that is diagnosed by the DRE as part of combined screening. Many men will refuse screening if it includes a rectal exam. It’s estimated that 90% of abnormal rectal exams will be false positives. On the other hand, I’ve had instances where quite a few men don’t feel like they have been adequately screened unless they have the DRE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZGUOSUUGGRHEZCPBOEQL5V4FXM"&gt;I have a discussion with every man about PSA testing, and I recommend it for most men in this age group. But I only rarely have had a man say that he doesn’t want it once he understands that we won’t recommend surgery unless the combination of all the studies show that this is a high-risk situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DUCKVO43SRGT5HCEDPLVL6KSRY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>OregonLive.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiywFBVV95cUxOU0QtbjRsNndYT0tBakJjWE9zclZPRXVtbEp6bnBqVzZqRXRoT1RNT1RmUjNWQ25lUkZmUGhpTF9POUxyQ0JpS0FNWnJxenM1eGRORnh1NDRsdHpEY1BQeW5KczZtQWNMQlJFbElkOEx1emRWOUpidk5lenVnYTdqa19HQ19zOE1XMlJBOVNKaExYNjY2b2o1NDQtU3RqZDhhZjB3Qlc1NWJMV2RrLWY4MS10ejJybTFpN3RCd0NnQ0pPRHpENDRRSjJvUdIB3wFBVV95cUxNZ05TUlgxVXloM3hrWVdQMG82YUYyR3VUZ3c3aG1hZk1Zd1p5d2FFTDZ6aGdqYjJRSkYtcGNsSXJDUHpDc0VLc0ptNnVDNW1Nd1dRSHptT0tTSW11UGNaczVnNWNWRDhhUDFnM0NrLU14SEtYS3cyY1VZZVpCdEJPQ2VVWDNlZklpQldodnFGSVV2NzJESlQwYTdiOFhoWjBRZWJhSXNpa19SZk9GMzM1VDBVeFBwaUpnWWN5cWtxQWxhQ0hWaU56eTR6ZFJMLUhsbjRNNktjd3J6QUh0ZlVn</guid></item><item><title>一位41岁的长寿医生说，他的“生物年龄”是24岁。他每天服用3种补充剂。- Business Insider | A 41-year-old longevity doctor says his 'biological age' is 24.

              &lt;p&gt;Dr. Mohammed Enayat has access to all sorts of experimental anti-aging treatments at his clinic, but a core part of his longevity routine is pretty cheap and accessible: supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enayat told Business Insider that his most recent "&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-the-maximum-age-of-humans-115-or-older-2023-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;biological age&lt;/a&gt;" tests taken 18 months ago said he was 24, or 17 years younger than his chronological age of 41. There's no consensus on how to define or measure biological age, but Enayat used GlycanAge and TruAge PACE, which measure inflammation and epigenetics, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary care doctor&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and the founder of London's HUM2N longevity clinic has been closely tracking his health for the past seven years, using wearable tech, including an &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/oura-ring-fitness-tracker-pros-cons-after-years-wearing-style-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Oura ring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/fitness-wearables-trackers-pros-cons-wellness-experts-2024-1#whoop-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Whoop strap&lt;/a&gt;, plus regular blood, urine, and &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microbiome-gut-bacteria-test-forgotten-organ-future-medicine-ubiome-photos-2018-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;microbiome tests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enayat changes his longevity routine depending on the results, including the supplements he takes.

If an amputation is at the upper arm, for example, they have to re-create upper arm, then the lower arm and finally, the hand. But if it’s at the lower arm, the cells have to know to grow back just the lower arm and hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JQL4S7FNU5BUTM3K474BMW3QNM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Salamanders have been famous for their ability to regenerate arms for centuries,” Monaghan said. “One of the outstanding questions that has really plagued the field is how a salamander knows what to grow back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZUPCZ5RWRNECPMBP77H4QPJL2Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For their study, Monaghan and his colleagues investigated a tiny molecule called retinoic acid that seems to be responsible for this careful choreography. A derivative of vitamin A, it is known for its regenerative ability and is related to retinol found in skin-care products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7KDUW7AXQRHCPFUHMZ5AQ2NLGE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Anyone that watches TV for 30 minutes watches a skin commercial with retinol,” Monaghan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EFXO4SE2EJALVA5IHVY4N7N5OQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;His team worked with axolotls that had been genetically engineered so that their tissue glows in the presence of the acid, allowing real-time tracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GGG4NNN7NNFCHLKCE56DBVDAZQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Then, in the name of vitally important science, the researchers did something that might strike some axolotl fans as shocking: they severed axolotl arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TQNM44G1192K3EYRXF2Q11W91M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Monaghan said his team anesthetized the axolotls before the procedure and closely monitored their health. “Importantly, they don’t show signs of pain or distress after limb amputation the way mammals might, and they regenerate fully within weeks,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PJADA8BNTT0G51QMR4WHGJB7U0" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When given a drug that blocks an enzyme responsible for breaking down retinoic acid, the axolotls regrew their missing limbs incorrectly, with an upper arm sprouting out where a forearm should be. A control group of animals that did not receive the drug regenerated normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="11CQVWV2N10BZBYHJ9H1MHCF3W" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The work suggests that retinoic acid acts like a GPS device, helping cells to determine their location: the higher the concentration of the acid, the closer to the center of the body. The chemical appears to activate a gene or genes within the cells to regulate limb growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="76DN6S5GNJCQFHUZMHUYH4C7ME" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“While we are still far from regenerating human limbs, this study is a step in that direction,” said Prayag Murawala, an assistant professor at MDI Biological Laboratory in Maine. His lab helped Monaghan produce the genetically engineered animals used in the study, but was otherwise not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AXRFHDMYBJCEZPBKJJXPFL3EVY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Better understanding of gene regulatory circuit is essential if we have to re-create this in humans,” Murawala said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="A43WAKWKB91U78GTM45NUN5KM8" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When it comes to human limb regeneration, Monaghan noted that every cell already contains in its DNA the blueprints to rebuild body parts. “We all have the same genes,” he said. “We’ve all made these limbs when we were embryos.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RPZU2JOU5ZAURKYL6NW4CCCTPM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The question now is figuring out the right chemical signals to unlock those early developmental instructions in humans after birth, as axolotls are able to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QQ4TOO5KEJCPROY6T5G24R722A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It’s one of the oldest questions in biology, but it’s also the most futuristic-looking,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="63JQVW63HJBVRI3AINPTVSOJUY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When Monaghan began his research two decades ago, “most people didn’t know what an axolotl was.” But for the past decade the animal has been &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/parenting/2024/12/19/axolotl-kids-animals-trends/"&gt;an obsession for kids&lt;/a&gt;, boosted in popularity after debuting in the video game “Minecraft” in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TYTKN6P4FFBILMLKBYXYENC2QA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It’s a little surreal,” he said. “You just see axolotls at the airport, axolotls at the mall.

Not only are they aesthetically pleasing, but essential oils also have much to offer in their therapeutic potential. Among such herbs that have received quite an attractive amount of attention for having extraordinary cognitive enhancement powers is rosemary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A landmark study in 2003 by researchers at&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10808709_Aromas_of_rosemary_and_lavender_essential_oils_differentially_affect_cognition_and_mood_in_healthy_adults" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt; Northumbria University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, such as Dr. Mark Moss, examined whether rosemary and lavender essential oil scents could have any impact on cognition and mood in healthy adults.

Research had been based on the premise that smells are able to affect the brain activity. The hypothesis was that smells would be able to affect the central nervous system or provoke memory-based responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this theory, 144 healthy volunteers were recruited and randomly assigned to one of three rooms: one scented with rosemary essential oil, one with lavender essential oil, and one unscented control room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five minutes before testing commenced, their respective essential oils were diffused for a consistent aromatic environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Measurement of cognitive function&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants underwent a series of cognitive tests focusing on working memory, attention, recall speed, and mental arithmetic. Alongside these, they completed mood assessments using validated psychological scales to gauge feelings such as alertness, contentment, and calmness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What set this study apart was its attempt to link the biochemical composition of essential oils—especially 1,8-cineole, a compound found in rosemary to actual performance changes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were indeed fascinating. The study subjects who received rosemary oil always did better than the control and the lavender groups in memory tests. Their scores in mental arithmetic speed and accuracy were much higher, particularly on serial subtractions that require hard concentration of mind and working memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the research discovered a positive relationship between blood levels of 1,8-cineole and enhanced cognitive function. That is, the higher the amount of this compound that was absorbed, presumably via inhalation, the better the test subjects performed. This indicated a dose-response relationship, further supporting the hypothesis that rosemary oil's active constituents were directly impacting brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, participants in the room's lavender scent were relaxed and content but their cognitive performance was relatively lower. This is in line with lavender's calming and sedative effects that can be of immense help in stress relief but would need a lot of caution in tasks requiring heightened alertness or sharp mental agility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How did rosemary work?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The supposed mechanism of action of rosemary in enhancing cognition centers on its main constituent, 1,8-cineole. This terpene affects neurotransmitter activity, especially acetylcholine, which is responsible for memory, learning, and concentration. The supposed mechanism by which 1,8-cineole acts is through the inhibition of the enzyme in charge of the breakdown of acetylcholine, thereby increasing its availability in the brain and assists in mental performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process is comparable to certain pharmaceutical cognitive enhancers or nootropics, but rosemary provides a natural, non-surgical option with little or no side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Applications in everyday life&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The applications of these results are extensive. For instance, rosemary essential oil may be utilized in schools as a means of enhancing focus for students when studying or taking exams. In the workplace, diffusing rosemary oil in offices may have the potential to enhance memory retention, alertness, and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing interest is also observed in the use of rosemary aromatherapy for cognitive care of the elderly, including those suffering from mild cognitive impairment or early Alzheimer's disease. Although additional clinical studies are required, preliminary signs look encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2003 Northumbria University study was one of the first to scientifically establish a clear link between aromatherapy and cognitive function, and it opened doors for more research in this area. While rosemary may never replace traditional cognitive therapies or medication, its potential as a safe, accessible, and affordable tool for mental performance is undeniable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the next time you're feeling groggy or inattentive, think about having a sniff of rosemary or diffuse its essential oil. Your brain may thank you for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-gFBVV95cUxPMlNDNGZzMHVxaGFjTC1IM25SUzBZRUY1VkdHU0NPNVNtSmpXeVFtNFhqaTBpQkotaG5DQ1RtNjBmeTFGTG5JVHRib1VvZGQ5QVRLV3NNS3JfRk9RVW5MY1NHLVVTRHRZUUpBUGY0R3BDaGRmazM4WkZoVjlEdWVlY3JvcG9oQ2tVZjZlNHc5S0RyZFJ5TXhQUlc0d1VMUUE0SjM2a2NjN2otWlpaLUZWVmNoUDllbkJHM05vVWFqZVRHdGxnRnZrS1k2NlROUjc0aTYwRXJYM1cwOXpUODZZMXZOazhOTno2ekJzdzV6OHVraXNvbXJMUWhB</guid></item><item><title>在现实世界中，肥胖注射可能具有较少的减肥效果：研究- NDTV | Obesity Injections May Have Fewer Weight Loss Effects In Real World: Study - NDTV</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="Art-exp_wr" id="ignorediv"&gt;

To facilitate this, Outro partners with compounding pharmacies to produce custom versions of generic antidepressants in minuscule doses that are not available commercially. In other words, while Outro promotes itself as a service for getting off medication, part of its business model hinges on people continuing to take the compounded drugs its clinicians prescribe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Horowitz, who has become one of the UK's leading experts on medication tapering, known as de-prescribing, says his interest in the topic was driven by his own harrowing experience coming off antidepressants more than a decade ago when he was a psychiatry doctoral student. Horowitz crafted a gradual tapering plan for himself that involved using syringes from his research lab to dole out small liquid doses of escitalopram, known by the brand name Lexapro. But he couldn’t prevent the misery induced by discontinuing the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“My life exploded,” Horowitz says. His symptoms, which included severe insomnia and dizziness, were so debilitating that he moved back in with his parents. “It took me years to come off, not weeks as guidelines recommended.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;After he recovered, Horowitz began pushing for doctors to adopt new clinical guidelines for getting off antidepressants. He coauthored the Royal College of Psychiatry's guidance for psychiatric drug cessation and joined the UK’s National Health Service as a clinical research fellow. His goal with Outro is to bring the guided tapering methods he has developed to a new patient base in North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Goode, Outro’s CEO, has a background working in pharmaceuticals and telehealth that includes stints at Novo Nordisk and the psychedelic therapy startup Field Trip Health, now known as Stella. “People kept asking how to use psychedelics to get off antidepressants,” Goode says, which led him to suspect there might be a substantial swath of the population who wanted help quitting the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Horowitz and Goode cofounded Outro in 2022 along with another Field Trip alum, Tyler Dyck. The company’s small team also includes Adele Framer, the founder of Surviving Antidepressants, a long-running forum where people swap tips on how to taper off this class of medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;It’s a fraught moment to be launching a health startup in the US focused on getting people off psychiatric drugs. The US secretary of health and human services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has questioned whether the medications are overprescribed, and has &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-health-stances-vaccines-fluoride-raw-milk-rcna180244" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-health-stances-vaccines-fluoride-raw-milk-rcna180244"}' href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-health-stances-vaccines-fluoride-raw-milk-rcna180244" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;made false claims&lt;/a&gt; linking antidepressants to school shootings and increased violence. Similar views have been articulated by other Trumpworld figures, including &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-elon-musk-really-not-leaving/"&gt;DOGE architect&lt;/a&gt; Elon Musk, &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.tiktok.com/@tuckercarlsonnetwork/video/7423800487243271467" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.tiktok.com/@tuckercarlsonnetwork/video/7423800487243271467"}' href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tuckercarlsonnetwork/video/7423800487243271467" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;who told&lt;/a&gt; Tucker Carlson that SSRIs are “the devil.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Horowitz says he shares some of Kennedy’s concerns about whether antidepressants are overprescribed and how severe withdrawals can be. But he’s disturbed that Outro’s project could be seen as aligned with the health secretary’s broader &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/trump-rfk-jr-make-america-healthy-again-government-position/"&gt;Make America Healthy Again&lt;/a&gt; movement, especially as he considers himself “to the left of Bernie Sanders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxQRFdXYWlKc3F0cVRUN1NxbEFXUXZSejB2Q0EtSGRHOVFvVkJwQ29hMWV0VVVFellJN0RCU1JucFNrOUN2WVZKWGxmdU1Jd1R0ejRpNEpBRjFTZmc0YkVQWVYzX0VyUTNzTVZyX19RajRJUndOeUdQSzJKamlTbjdxNQ</guid></item><item><title>医生揭示了可以显示“定时炸弹”心脏问题的简单拇指测试-每日邮报 | Doctor reveals the simple thumb test that can show a 'ticking time bomb' heart problem - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An emergency doctor has flagged a one-minute DIY test that could reveal a 'ticking time bomb' killer heart condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Joe Whittington, an emergency medicine expert from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-d1514380-4541-11f0-9f7a-95242bad376f" class=""&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, said the hack, which involves stretching your thumb across the wrist, could indicate a high risk of suffering an aortic aneurysm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This involves the aorta—the main artery carrying blood from the heart to the rest of the body—bulging or swelling, risking a rupture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ruptures in the blood vessel are often fatal due to severe internal bleeding, unless treated rapidly with emergency surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a video on &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-7beecff0-45de-11f0-bf2f-51398b908bcb"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; that has so far amassed over 230,000 views, Dr Whittington told his followers: 'Hold up your palm and try and stretch your thumb across as far as you can. Does it stop about there? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Or does it extend pass your palm like these? If it does that is a positive thumb-palm test.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If your thumb extends past your palm this could mean your connective tissues are 'very stretchy', he said, indicating that the same stretchiness applies to the tissues in the arteries, meaning a high chance of swelling or bulging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He went on to detail a 2021 study, published in the American Journal of Cardiology, which found 60 per cent of people with known aortic aneurysms had a positive palm-thumb test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-embed"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@drjoe_md/video/7513245123090681119" data-video-id="7513245123090681119" data-embed-from="oembed"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a title="@drjoe_md" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drjoe_md?refer=embed"&gt;@drjoe_md&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Can your thumb predict a hidden heart problem? 🫣 The “thumb-to-palm” test was linked to a higher risk of ascending aortic aneurysm in a Yale study, almost 60% of patients with aneurysms had a positive result. But before you panic, this doesn’t mean you have one. It’s just one potential sign of stretchy connective tissue, which could also mean a stretchy aorta. If your thumb crosses your palm, especially with a family history of heart issues or connective tissue disorders, talk to your doctor. Flexibility is great… just not in your arteries. 😅 &lt;a title="hearthealth" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/hearthealth?refer=embed"&gt;#hearthealth&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="ehlersdanlossyndrome" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/ehlersdanlossyndrome?refer=embed"&gt;#ehlersdanlossyndrome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="connectivetissuedisorder" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/connectivetissuedisorder?refer=embed"&gt;#connectivetissuedisorder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="healthtips" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/healthtips?refer=embed"&gt;#healthtips&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a title="♬ original sound - Dr. Joe, M.D. 🩺" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7513245189529029407?refer=embed"&gt;♬ original sound - Dr. Joe, M.D. 🩺&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Here is the test: Hold your hand up as if you're telling someone to stop (1). With your palm flat, stretch your thumb as far as you can across it, towards your little finger. If your thumb reaches the middle of the palm (2) that is normal. However, if it stretches past the edge of your hand (3), researchers say this may be a sign of an aortic aneurysm and you should get it checked&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers gave the test to 305 patients underdoing cardiac surgery for a variety of disorders, including aortic aneurysms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the majority of aneurysm patients do not manifest a positive thumb-palm sign,, patients who did have a positive test had a high likelihood of harboring an aneurysm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's estimated that around 5,000 people in the UK die from aorta-related problems every year, with aneurysms and dissections being the leading causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While many aneurysms don't cause symptoms until they rupture, doctors may spot them during routine test and offer&lt;span&gt; treatments to prevent damage such as blood pressure medication. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those that do cause symptoms tend to trigger pain in the chest, neck, and/or back; swelling of the head, neck and arms; coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, or coughing up blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But those with a positive palm-thumb test, 'should not freak out', said Dr Whittington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's worth bringing it up with your doctor so they can diver deeper into any sort of connective tissue disorders.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; There are over 200 disorders that impact connective tissue, but there are different types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In a study published in the American Journal of Cardiology, found 60% of people with known aortic aneurysms had a positive palm-thumb test&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include genetic disorders like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, autoimmune disorders such as lupus and cancers like some types of soft tissue sarcoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The three most common aortic-related connective tissue disorders are Marfan Syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) and Loeys-Dietz Syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.marfantrust.org/pages/15-marfan-syndrome"&gt;over 18,000 people&lt;/a&gt; are affected by Marfan syndrome, although it is believed to remain undiagnosed in many people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.marfantrust.org/pages/15-marfan-syndrome"&gt;Experts estimate&lt;/a&gt; nearly half of people who have the condition don't know it, so knowing the signs can save lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It can cause symptoms like heart palpitations, eye pain, shortness of breath and vision changes like astigmatism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can affect other parts of the body giving physical features like long and narrow face, limbs that seem too long for the rest of the body, and crowded teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those with this condition are at up to a 250 times greater risk of aortic dissection, a tear or rupture between layers of the aortic wall, than the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;EDS is a group of inherited connective tissue disorders affecting the skin, joints and blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

And even after early discontinuation (within 3 months), there wasn’t the rapid weight regain seen in some of the trials. Improvements in A1c were also seen among those with prediabetes even after discontinuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.24331"&gt;The findings&lt;/a&gt;, published on June 10, 2025 in &lt;em&gt;Obesity&lt;/em&gt;, are the latest from a team that has previously reported on the &lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/most-stop-taking-weight-loss-drugs-within-1-year-2023a1000uiq"&gt;high prevalence&lt;/a&gt; of discontinuation of weight-loss medications. Now, they’re delving further into the phenomenon, lead author Hamlet Gasoyan, PhD, a researcher with Center for Value-Based Care Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, told &lt;em&gt;Medscape Medical News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even though we did know that…discontinuation with these medications is common, and we already knew from randomized trials that after discontinuation patients tend to regain weight, we don’t really know the whole picture of use patterns in the real world in terms of timing of discontinuation, and most importantly, what patients can expect in terms of changes in their weight and also, if they have prediabetes, changes in their glycemic control based on discontinuation status,” Gasoyan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding of the prevalent use of low maintenance doses and the association between that and the clinical outcomes was a surprise. “We did not expect to see such a stark difference between what is happening in clinical trials vs in the real world,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked to comment, Timothy Garvey, MD, the Charles E. Butterworth, Jr professor and university professor at The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and director of the UAB Diabetes Research Center at Birmingham, Alabama, called the study “really, really great,” and said that it fills in some of the knowledge gaps regarding real-world use of these drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Many] people never even fill the prescription, and then by a year, more than half are off it…This paper really documents this very well and shows it to be multifactorial. It also shows that we’re not in a position to have pharmacotherapy to treat this disease on a chronic basis,” said Garvey, who was lead investigator for several pivotal randomized clinical weight-loss trials for &lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/981005"&gt;both semaglutide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/993660"&gt;and tirzepatide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garvey also noted that the findings regarding sub-maximal dose use are novel and valuable. “Obesity medicine experts kind of know this, but it [hasn’t been] knowledge because it [had] never been published in a peer reviewed journal, so this makes it knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low Maintenance Doses, Lower Weight Loss &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included electronic health record data from 7881 adults with overweight or obesity but not diabetes who initiated injectable semaglutide (n = 6109) or tirzepatide (n = 1772) during 2021-2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the first year, 21.6% on semaglutide and 16.4% on tirzepatide discontinued the drug early (within 3 months of initiating), while 31.4% and 34.1%, respectively, discontinued later (within 3-12 months). The rest — 47.0% (n = 2874) with semaglutide and 49.4% (n = 876) with tirzepatide — stayed on the drug beyond a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, 1-year discontinuation rates in the main phase 3 randomized clinical trials were 17.1% with once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg (&lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/945630"&gt;STEP 1&lt;/a&gt;), and 14.2%-16.4% for tirzepatide (&lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/975061"&gt;SURMOUNT-1&lt;/a&gt;), the authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the patients, 80.8%, were on low maintenance doses, defined as below 1.7 mg semaglutide and below 10.0 mg for tirzepatide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of 6477 individuals with 1-year data available, the mean overall percentage weight reduction was 8.7%. By medication, weight reduction at 1 year was 7.7% with semaglutide and 12.4% with tirzepatide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, the average weight loss in the phase 3 clinical trials was 14.9% for once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg, 15.0% for tirzepatide 5 mg, and 20.9% for tirzepatide 15 mg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current trial, among those with early, late, or no discontinuation, the percentage weight losses were 3.6%, 6.8%, and 11.9%, respectively (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001). The trends were similar by medication: 2.9%, 5.8%, and 10.9%, respectively, for semaglutide and 7.0%, 10.4%, and, 15.3%, respectively, for tirzepatide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals who continued taking the medications at high maintenance doses (1.7 mg, 2.0 mg, or 2.4 mg of semaglutide or 10.0 mg, 12.5 mg, or 15.0 mg of tirzepatide) lost a mean of 14.7% at 1 year, including 13.7% with semaglutide and 18.0% with tirzepatide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In multivariate analysis, the odds of achieving ≥ 10% weight loss at 1 year were significantly higher among those who continued taking the medication (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 4.68 [vs early discontinuation] and 1.74 [vs late discontinuation]), who took tirzepatide vs semaglutide (aOR, 2.46), who used high vs low medication doses (aOR, 2.39), and who were women vs men (aOR, 1.86).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevention of Diabetes Progression, Even After Quitting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the 895 patients who had prediabetes at baseline and A1c measurements at 1 year, the mean absolute A1c reduction at 1 year was 0.3 percentage points overall, 0.1 for those who discontinued early, 0.2 for those with late discontinuation, and 0.4 for those who didn’t discontinue (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001). Overall A1c reduction at 1 year was 0.3 points with semaglutide and 0.4 with tirzepatide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 53.9% of the baseline prediabetes group converted to normoglycemia at 1 year, including 33.1% with early discontinuation, 41.0% with late discontinuation, and 67.9% of those who stayed on the medications. Progression to type 2 diabetes occurred in 6.5%, 4.4%, and 1.7% of those groups, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s a very encouraging finding, which confirms the efficacy of this medications for the prevention of type 2 diabetes but also highlights the importance of persistence with treatment if the goal is prevention of type 2 diabetes,” Gasoyan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Are People Doing After They Drop the Drug?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the patients who discontinued the drugs lost significantly less weight than those who continued taking them, “weight trajectories remained surprisingly stable after discontinuation throughout the study follow-up period. This contrasts what has been observed after medication discontinuation at the end of randomized trials,” Gasoyan and colleagues wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand this finding, the investigators also looked at other measures the patients might have taken after discontinuation, such as other medications or adopting new lifestyle habits or undergoing bariatric surgery. They’ll report those findings soon, Gasoyan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, he noted, “it’s easier to maintain smaller weight loss compared to maintaining a larger weight loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team is also planning to report findings for why patients discontinued the medications. “We are gathering information on independent predictors that hopefully in the future could help us develop a prediction tool to give relatively reasonable estimates on what a patient can expect at the time of treatment initiation,” Gasoyan told &lt;em&gt;Medscape Medical News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garvey is looking forward to newer, better obesity drugs. “The unmet clinical need is a medicine that’s well tolerated, that gives us 15 or 20% weight loss, is affordable and is accessible...We don’t have that, and this is the consequence…Everyone’s fixated on [GLP-1 receptor agonists], but I don’t think we’re going to get past these [gastrointestinal] side effects…There are a lot of other drugs in early phases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gasoyan had no disclosures.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Garvey served on advisory boards, conducted clinical trials, and/or served on data monitoring committees for Boehringer Ingelheim; Eli Lilly and Company; Novo Nordisk; Pfizer; Fractyl Health, Inc.; Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Inogen; Zealand Pharma; Allurion; Carmot Therapeutics/Roche; Terns Pharmaceuticals; Neurocrine Biosciences; Keros Therapeutics; Gan &amp;amp; Lee Pharmaceuticals; Regeneron; Epitomee; Neurovalens; Viking Therapeutics, Inc.; and the Milken Family Foundation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miriam E.

With this test, measure out 1m (3.3ft), followed by 4m. The idea is to use the first metre to get up to speed, then time how long it takes to walk for 4m at your usual pace. To work out your speed, divide four metres by the number of seconds it took you to walk that distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="callout-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fpVHcM"&gt;&lt;section class="sc-2d378821-0 duQDIB"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2d378821-1 dBCBSi"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-2d378821-3 djFilw"&gt;Find out how you compare&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2d378821-2 bjvxgb"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2d378821-4 fhPqsm"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For an idea of how you compare to other people, the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21820535/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;average walking speed&lt;/a&gt; of a 40-49 woman is 1.39m/s (4.6ft/s), and 1.43m/s (4.7ft/s) for a 40-49-year-old man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2d378821-4 fhPqsm"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;If you are aged 50-59, then the average walking speed is 1.31m/s (4.3ft/s) for a woman, and 1.43m/s (4.7ft/s) for a man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2d378821-4 fhPqsm"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For 60-69 year-olds, average gait speed falls to 1.24m/s (4.1ft/s) for a woman, and 1.43m/s (4.7ft/s).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2d378821-4 fhPqsm"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For 70-79 year-olds, average walking speed is 1.13m/s (3.7ft/s) for a woman, and 1.26m/s (4.16ft/s) for a man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2d378821-4 fhPqsm"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Finally, for 80-89 year-olds, gait speed is around 0.94m/s (3.1ft) for a woman, and 0.97m/s (3.2ft/s) for a man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Alternatively, there are many apps you can use to measure your walking speed, including fitness trackers like Walkmeter, MapMyWalk, Strava, and Google Fit, which use GPS to track distance and time, allowing them to calculate your speed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Studies have shown that gait speed is a significant predictor of life expectancy in older adults. For example, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh pooled together the results of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3080184/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;nine studies&lt;/a&gt; which collectively tracked more than 34,000 community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older aged between six and 21 years. The study showed that that gait speed was significantly associated with lifespan. For example, men with the slowest walking speeds at age 75 had a 19% chance of living for 10 years, compared to men with the fastest walking speeds who had an 87% chance of survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;One explanation is that people who are already unwell tend to be less mobile. However a 2009 &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b4460" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;study in France&lt;/a&gt; found that even amongst healthy adults aged over 65, participants with low walking speed were around three times more likely to die of cardiovascular disease during the study period compared with people who walked faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Walking seems like such a simple thing – most of us don't think about it, we just do it," says Line Rasmussen, a senior researcher in the department of Psychology and Neuroscience at Duke University, North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lh83lb.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lh83lb.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lh83lb.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lh83lb.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lh83lb.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lh83lb.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lh83lb.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lh83lb.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lh83lb.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lh83lb.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images The bodies of slower walkers age at a faster pace (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;The bodies of slower walkers age at a faster pace (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"But walking actually relies on many different body systems working together: your bones and muscles carry and move you, your eyes help you see where you're going, your heart and lungs circulate blood and oxygen, and your brain and nerves coordinate it all," Rasmussen adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;According to Rasmussen, as we age, the function of these systems starts to slow down – and a slower walking speed can therefore reflect this overall decline and be a sign of advanced ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This doesn't just apply to older adults.

"You might expect everyone at 45 to be somewhere in the middle, but some walked as quickly as healthy 20-year-olds, while others walked as slowly as much older adults," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The study revealed that 45-year-olds with slower gait speeds showed signs of "accelerated ageing", with their lungs, teeth and immune systems in poorer shape compared to those who walked faster. They also had 'biomarkers' associated with a faster rate of ageing, such as raised blood pressure, high cholesterol, and lower cardiorespiratory fitness. The found that slow walkers  had other signs of physical ill health, too, such as weaker hand-grip strength and more difficulty rising from a chair. &lt;b id="(" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;&lt;i id="(" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;(&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b id="read-more-from-the-bbc-about-the" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;&lt;i id="read-more-from-the-bbc-about-the" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Read more from the BBC about the &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250417-grip-strength-the-test-for-your-chances-of-living-to-100" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;b id="test-for-your-chances-of-living-to-100" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;&lt;i id="test-for-your-chances-of-living-to-100" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;test for your chances of living to 100&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b id="and" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b id="the" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;&lt;i id="the" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;the &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250404-sit-to-stand-the-simple-test-that-reveals-how-youre-ageing" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;b id="test-that-reveals-how-well-you're-ageing" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;&lt;i id="test-that-reveals-how-well-you're-ageing" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;test that reveals how well you're ageing&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b id=".)" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;&lt;i id=".)" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;.) &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Rasmussen and colleagues also found that slow walkers showed signs of advanced cognitive ageing. For example, they tended to score lower on IQ tests overall, performing worse on tests of memory, processing speed, reasoning and other cognitive functions. MRI scans also showed that this cognitive deterioration was accompanied by observable changes in the participants' brains. Slower walkers had smaller brains, a thinner neocortex – the outermost layer of the brain, which controls thinking and higher information processing – and more white matter. Intriguingly, even the faces of slow walkers were rated as ageing at a faster rate than the other participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In all, the research suggests that the bodies and brains of slow walkers age at a faster rate to those of quick walkers. There were also signs that these health differences were present from an early age, as researchers were able to predict the walking speed of 45-year-olds based on intelligence, language and motor skills tests taken when the participants were just three years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Walking more regularly can help to boost your walking speed (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Walking more regularly can help to boost your walking speed (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"What surprised me most was finding a link between how fast people walked at age 45 and their cognitive abilities all the way back in early childhood," says Rasmussen. "This suggests that walking speed is not just a sign of ageing, but also a window into lifelong brain health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, readers who class themselves as slow walkers needn't be too disheartened, as there are many things we can do to improve our walking speed. As part of her research to help cancer patients, Dieli-Conwright produces exercise regimes to help people recovering from chemotherapy regain their strength. Participants are advised to increase the duration and intensity of their walking exercise every three to four weeks to improve their fitness. And there are even simpler things that people can do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Take any opportunity you can to walk more regularly, as remaining physically active is so important," says Dieli-Conwright. Her tips include parking further away from your destination, meeting up with friends to walk socially, or taking a pet to the local park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It's important to take walking breaks, especially for individuals who have a more sedentary job," says Dieli-Conwright. "Even if it's just a five-minute walking break to go to the bathroom, or a five-minute quick walk around the block – it's vital to interrupt that sitting time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;b id="facebook" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;b id="x" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;b id="instagram" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 09:01:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxQM1BnVDdVY1Nfc2VGcVNQSUV5MzB1cWM2cGJJWWg4TGhXaGxFV2VTRjBDbEk5QmVaWXdCYldKUFlKZ3lHYmJ6OEc5Z3FlcXBQdUZIQ3NDSG5HTHVycjRwa2xOWkE5cnFSU3lkSDlqMFlaWHJZOXlIWnFfczE3aV9OU0J0dXE1TnB1Z1pNZmZMX2NHdEVxcXpfdmNGWUctVnoySWc</guid></item><item><title>如何避免游泳者的耳朵？ -《纽约时报》 | How Can I Avoid Swimmer’s Ear? - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxQNDE0WTVreWVrakljX09Hem1GekgxQzlUN2V4c19hbUt4dEEyb1ZKbnhfR2tjMlhZeVNFQjgyVUZzMGRITHFpQXNNcGlEUjlIVFI0TVNrbmdUX1J0NkNfZkgxbnFGRXgwRHJiSWVHckl5SmVvRnpkRFZrNXA2UDMxTlFOQ29zQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"&gt;Q: Last summer, my ear started feeling itchy and really painful after swimming. How can I avoid it this year?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Swimmer’s ear is an infection of the ear canal that can plague water lovers and anyone else who sweats, showers or simply lives in a humid climate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Nearly &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/fullarticle/2805359" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;1 in 10 people&lt;/a&gt; will experience a bout of this infection in their lifetime. Summer, unsurprisingly, is &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6019a2.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;prime time for swimmer’s ear&lt;/a&gt;. Both children and adults can get swimmer’s ear — and those who are immunocompromised, have diabetes or other underlying conditions are at greater risk of both getting it and having complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Not to be confused with the annoying sensation of trapped water in your ear, acute swimmer’s ear will get your attention quickly. “It’s exquisitely painful,” said Dr. Sapna Singh, a pediatrician and chief medical officer at Texas Children’s Pediatrics in Houston. “I’ve seen teenagers come in in tears.” The ear canal can become itchy and swollen and may leak fluid or a smelly discharge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The good news: With prescription ear drops, most people start to feel better within a few days. Still, doctors recommend keeping water out of your ear canal for a week or more, depending on how severe the infection is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;If not treated, complications can ensue, including chronic swimmer’s ear and, in rarer cases, an infection that spreads beyond the ear canal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

First identified at the end of January, the variant—called NB.1.8.1 but known informally as “Nimbus”—is a descendant of the Omicron family of Covid sublineages, and has become increasingly prevalent throughout the spring in Europe, the Americas, and the Western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The virus has mutations that may increase its infectiousness and allow it to escape certain antibodies. Nevertheless, “considering the available evidence, the additional public health risk posed by NB.1.8.1 is evaluated as low at the global level,” the WHO wrote in its most recent &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;risk evaluation&lt;/a&gt; for the variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Like other variants before it, Nimbus has specific mutations to its spike protein. These proteins coat the virus’s surface and are what it uses to gain entry into cells, where it reproduces. Nimbus’ spike protein modifications could increase its transmission capacity and partially reduce the neutralizing efficacy of certain antibodies generated by previous infections, both of which would contribute to its spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;However, the WHO says that there is no evidence that this variant causes more severe disease compared to other strains currently circulating. Nor have increases in hospitalizations or deaths related to its emergence been observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Symptoms associated with NB.1.8.1 are similar to those caused by other SARS-CoV-2 variants: sore throat, cough, fatigue, fever, muscle aches, loss of taste or smell, respiratory distress, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The WHO experts explain that, although this variant may partially evade some antibody responses, such “immune escape” is comparable to that observed in other Omicron sublineages. This suggests that the mutations present in NB.1.8.1 do not give the virus increased resistance to antivirals such as nirmatrelvir, and that current vaccines continue to be effective in preventing severe disease when infected with this version of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;However, to those most vulnerable to Covid—such as the elderly, immunocompromised, or those with preexisting chronic conditions—Nimbus represents a new health threat, and these groups should stay up to date with booster vaccinations to ensure they are protected against Covid’s worst effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt;

In 2019 WEHI researchers discovered that marker spiked in the bloodstream of coeliacs shortly after they ate gluten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Researchers analysed blood samples from 181 volunteers between the ages of 18 and 75 recruited at Royal Melbourne hospital. These included 75 people with coeliac disease who had been on a gluten-free diet for at least a year, 13 with active, untreated coeliac disease, 32 with non-coeliac gluten sensitivity and 61 controls who did not have coeliac disease nor gluten sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Using a new diagnostic system developed with Novoviah Pharmaceuticals, participant blood samples were mixed with gluten to see if the IL-2 signal appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;They found the test detected the condition with up to 90% sensitivity and 97% specificity – even in patients following a strict gluten-free diet, the lead author, Olivia Moscatelli, who was diagnosed with coeliac disease at 18, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Novoviah Pharmaceuticals was an industry partner on the study, but played no role in the execution or interpretation of the research, authors said.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Cleveland Clinic study shows that semaglutide and tirzepatide—injectable GLP-1 drugs for obesity—produce smaller weight loss in a real-world setting because patients discontinue treatment or use lower maintenance dosages. Treatment discontinuation also negatively impacted blood sugar control in patients with prediabetes. The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.24331" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; was published in the &lt;i&gt;Obesity Journal&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Hamlet Gasoyan, Ph.D., lead author of the study and a researcher with Cleveland Clinic's Center for Value-Based Care Research, said, "Our study shows that patients treated for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/obesity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; with semaglutide or tirzepatide lost less weight on average in a regular clinical setting compared to what is observed in randomized &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+trials/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"According to our data, this could be explained by higher rates of discontinuation and lower maintenance dosages used in clinical practice, compared to randomized clinical trial settings."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide (sold under the brand names Wegovy and Ozempic) and tirzepatide (sold under the brand names Zepbound and Mounjaro) are FDA-approved medications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and chronic weight management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While randomized clinical trials have shown the efficacy of those medications, Dr. Gasoyan and colleagues studied their effect on weight reduction and blood sugar regulation (glycemic control) in a real-world setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Cleveland Clinic &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/retrospective+cohort+study/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;retrospective cohort study&lt;/a&gt; included 7,881 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/adult+patients/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;adult patients&lt;/a&gt; with an average body mass index (BMI) greater than 39, which is classified as clinically severe obesity. Among the participants, 1,320 had pre-diabetes at the start of the study, defined by blood sugar levels between 5.7–6.4%. Patients who have pre-diabetes are at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, which is one of the most common complications of obesity.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The study participants began treatment for obesity with injectable forms of semaglutide or tirzepatide between 2021 and 2023. Researchers grouped patients who discontinued their obesity medications into those who discontinued early (within three months) and late (within three to 12 months). The study's follow-up ended in December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that more than 20% of patients discontinued their medications early and 32% discontinued their medications late. In addition, more than 80% of study participants were on lower maintenance dosages of those medications (i.e., equal to or less than 1 mg for semaglutide and equal to or less than 7.5 mg for tirzepatide). The maintenance dose refers to the amount of medication needed to sustain a therapeutic effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year after the start of the treatment, researchers found that the average weight reduction was 3.6% among the participants who discontinued their treatment early, compared to 6.8% for those who discontinued their treatment late. Those who did not discontinue treatment lost on average 11.9% body weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who did not discontinue treatment and were on high maintenance dosage of the medications lost 13.7% of their body weight with semaglutide and 18.0% with tirzepatide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings about the real-world use patterns of these medications and associated clinical outcomes could inform the decisions of health care providers and their patients on the role of treatment discontinuation and maintenance dosage in achieving clinically meaningful weight reductions," said Dr. Gasoyan.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Researchers also identified what factors were associated with higher odds of achieving weight loss of 10% or more, which provides clinically significant health benefits in this patient population. Patients had higher odds of achieving 10% or greater &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/weight+reduction/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;weight reduction&lt;/a&gt; after one year of treatment if they:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;did not discontinue their medications or discontinued late (vs. early)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;were on high maintenance dosage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;received tirzepatide (vs. semaglutide)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;were female (vs. male).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to looking at the factors that affect a person's weight trajectory, researchers tracked glycemic control in patients who had pre-diabetes at the start of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the participants with pre-diabetes, 33% of those who discontinued their treatment early experienced normal blood sugar levels (defined by an HbA1c level of 5.6 or lower), compared to 41% who discontinued their treatment late, and 67.9% who did not discontinue treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In our study, the majority of the patients with pre-diabetes experienced normal blood sugar levels when they continued their treatment," said Dr. Gasoyan. "Type 2 diabetes is one of the most common complications of obesity, so diabetes prevention is very important. This study highlights that treatment discontinuation, especially early, negatively affects both weight and glycemic control outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common reasons for discontinuation of treatment included the cost of the medications and insurance coverage–related issues, side effects, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/medication/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medication&lt;/a&gt; shortages. A follow-up study is in the works to quantify why patients discontinue their obesity medications in a real-world setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, researchers observed that while patients who discontinued obesity medications lost significantly less weight compared to those who persisted, their weight trajectories remained relatively stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be studied further to identify what additional weight management methods patients are using in real world settings after discontinuation of obesity medications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to boost your cardiovascular fitness, strengthen your bones and joints, and boost your mood, you might think lacing up a set of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-running-shoes" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-running-shoes"&gt;best running shoes&lt;/a&gt; and heading out the door is the solution. But what if running just isn’t for you? I’ve got good news — according to NASA, rebounding is more effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebounding, or bouncing on a mini trampoline, is a low-impact workout that soared in popularity in the 1980s. At the same time, NASA did a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/jappl.1980.49.5.881" target="_blank" data-url="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/jappl.1980.49.5.881" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that found just 10 minutes of rebounding could be 68% more effective than a 30-minute run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight participants, aged between 19 and 26, walked and ran on a treadmill at four speeds, and jumped on a trampoline at four heights. Researchers looked at oxygen uptake, acceleration levels, and heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results found that trampolining put a lot less pressure on the participants’ bodies than the treadmill. What’s more, “the external work output at equivalent levels of oxygen uptake were significantly greater while trampolining than running.” Notably, “the greatest difference was about 68%.” Rebounding made the participant’s joints and muscles work harder than running did, even though their hearts and lungs were working at the same levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate of oxygen consumption was also found to be twice as efficient when rebounding than treadmill running, plus recovery times were quicker. While there’s drawbacks to the research (it was conducted exclusively on men and the sample size is small), this high-intensity, low-impact form of cardio might be one to consider if you’re looking for a new challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-are-the-benefits-of-rebounding"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What are the benefits of rebounding? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While running primarily engages the muscles in the lower body, rebounding is a full-body workout. Your legs work hard when bouncing, as does your core, which has to stabilize your body. As you jump, you’re working on your balance and coordination, as well as burning calories. If losing weight is your goal, you’ll need to ensure you’re in a calorie deficit — burning more calories than you consume. The best way to keep an eye on your calorie burn is to strap one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html"&gt;best fitness trackers&lt;/a&gt; to your wrist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebounding is great for building cardio endurance, as your heart rate will skyrocket as you jump. It’s also a fun workout — there’s a reason why toddlers love bouncing on a trampoline.

                Justin Carlyle, age 23, photographed on the street in Kensington, a neighborhood of Philadelphia, has lived with addiction to fentanyl and other drugs for a decade. After a decade when overdoses devastated young Americans, drug deaths among people in the U.S. under age 35 are plummeting. The shift is saving thousands of young lives every year.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;When Justin Carlyle, 23, began experimenting with drugs a decade ago, he found himself part of a generation of young Americans caught in the devastating wave of harm caused by fentanyl addiction and overdose.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I use fentanyl, cocaine, crack cocaine, yeah, all of it," Carlyle said, speaking to NPR on the streets of Kensington, a working class neighborhood in Philadelphia where dealers sell drugs openly. "I was real young. I was 13 or 14 when I tried cocaine, crack cocaine, for the first time."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As an elevated train rumbled overhead, Carlyle described turning to fentanyl, xylazine and other increasingly toxic street drugs. "I've had three overdoses, and two of the times I was definitely Narcaned," he said, referring to a medication, also known as naloxone, that reverses potentially fatal opioid overdoses.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Carlyle's teens and early 20s have been wracked by severe drug use, but the fact that he's still alive means he's part of a hopeful new national trend.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What we're seeing is a massive reduction in [fatal] overdose risk, among Gen Z in particular," said Nabarun Dasgupta, an addiction researcher at the University of North Carolina. "Ages 20 to 29 lowered the risk by 47%, cut it right in half."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This stunning drop in drug deaths among people in the U.S.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is being tracked in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other federal agencies.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The latest available records found fentanyl and other drugs killed more than 31,000 people (see chart) under the age of 35 in 2021. By last year, that number had plummeted to roughly 16,690 fatal overdoses, according to provisional CDC data.  &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The life-saving shift is welcome news for parents like Jon Epstein, who lost his son Cal to fentanyl in 2020. "What has happened with the 20- to 29-year-olds?  They beat fentanyl," said Epstein, who works with &lt;a href="https://www.songforcharlie.org/" target="_blank"&gt;a national drug awareness group focused on young people called Song for Charlie&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-70926" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

His father, Jon Epstein, and mother, Jennifer Epstein, joined a movement of activist parents in a group called Song for Charlie that works to raise awareness about the risks of fentanyl and other street drugs. Also shown is Cal's brother, Miles Epstein.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;For America's young, a decade of unprecedented carnage&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To understand the significance of this promising trend, it's important to recall the terror and devastation wrought by fentanyl among families and communities in the U.S.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Beginning around 2014, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6533a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. officials say Mexican drug cartels began smuggling large quantities of fentanyl into American communities&lt;/a&gt;, often disguising the street drug as counterfeit prescription pills resembling OxyContin or Percocet.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, drug overdoses among young people surged, killing more than 230,000 people under the age of 35. For many families and whole communities, the losses felt catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We went to check on [Cal] and he was unresponsive," Jon Epstein recalled. "We made it to the hospital, but he didn't make it home. It was a bolt out of the blue."  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-70970" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Cal Epstein was 18, a college student. According to the family, it's not clear why he decided to take an opioid pill. He tried to purchase a prescription-grade pill from a dealer on social media. In fact, it was a counterfeit pill containing a deadly dose of fentanyl.  &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;While grieving, Jon Epstein started learning about fentanyl, digging through public health data. He found other kids in his town of Beaverton, Ore., were dying. "They had lost four students [to fatal overdoses in the local school district] in the preceding year," he recalled.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Jon and his wife, Jennifer Epstein, connected with a growing network of shattered parents around the country who were waking up to a terrifying fact: Fentanyl, often sold on social media platforms, was making it into their homes and killing their kids.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Like many grieving families, they turned their sorrow into activism. Through the group Song for Charlie, they worked to educate young people and parents about the unique dangers of fentanyl.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The game has completely changed, especially for kids who are going through an experimental phase," Jon Epstein warned in a video distributed nationally. "An experimental phase is now deadly." This message — summed up by the phrase &lt;em&gt;One pill can kill&lt;/em&gt; —  began spreading in schools and on social media nationwide but for years the wave of death seemed unsolvable.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40392279/" target="_blank"&gt;study published last month in the journal &lt;em&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researcher Noa Krawczyk at the NYU Grossman School of Public Health found deaths attributed entirely to fentanyl "nearly quadrupled" among people people age 15 to 24 from 2018 through 2022.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"In your generation, people used drugs. In my generation people used drugs, we just didn't use to die as much from them," Krawcyzk said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Especially among teenagers in the U.S., fentanyl deaths seemed stuck at catastrophic levels, between 1,500 and 2,000 fatal overdoses a year. Then last year, federal data revealed a stunning decline, with 40% fewer teens experiencing fatal overdoses. "We're super heartened to finally see teens dropping," Epstein said. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the improvement is dramatic, Dasgupta at the University of North Carolina, found the recovery among teens appears uneven.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some teens and twenty-somethings are seeing far fewer deaths, but he identified one cluster born between 2005 and 2011 who actually saw a slight uptick in deaths over the past two years. The increase is relatively small — about 300 additional fatalities nationwide over two years — but Dasgupta said it's an area of concern that needs more study to determine why. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The question now is what changed that is suddenly saving so many young lives?  Drug policy experts are scrambling to understand the shift.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Many U.S. kids appear more cautious about drug use  &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Theories include the wider distribution of Narcan, or naloxone; a trend of weaker, less deadly fentanyl being sold by dealers; more readily available addiction healthcare; and also the loss of so many vulnerable young people who have already died.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Many researchers believe another key factor may be less risky drug and alcohol use among teens and twenty-somethings, a pattern that emerged during the years of the COVID epidemic. &lt;a href="https://monitoringthefuture.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/mtf2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;One study by a team at the University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt; found the number of teens abstaining from substance grew to its highest level in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This trend in the reduction of substance use among teenagers is unprecedented," Nora D. Volkow, who has served as director of the U.S. government's National Institute on Drug Abuse since 2003, said &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/reported-use-most-drugs-among-adolescents-remained-low-2024" target="_blank"&gt;in a statement last December.&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Keith Humphreys, an addiction researcher at Stanford University, credits this apparent behavioral shift with helping save lives. "There's fewer people initiating with these substances. That should work in our favor," he told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to Dasgupta at the University of North Carolina, years of devastation caused by fentanyl and other opioids might mean more people in their teens and twenties are choosing to experiment with less risky drugs.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Alcohol and opioids are on the outs with Gen Z, and instead we see [a shift to] cannabis and psychedelics, and those are inherently safer drugs," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Overall, this positive trend among younger Americans is outpacing the wider opioid recovery in the U.S., which saw 27% fewer fatal overdoses across all age groups in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Will drug deaths keep dropping for young Americans? &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While this news is promising — roughly 15,000 fewer drug deaths among young people in the U.S. in 2024, according to preliminary data, compared with the deadliest year 2021 — researchers say sustaining progress may be difficult. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's because many of the young people still most at risk, like Justin Carlyle in Philadelphia, aren't just experimenting with drugs. They're struggling with full blown addiction.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What I'm used to is getting high, you know?" he said.   &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Despite the danger of a fatal overdose, Carlyle told NPR he has tried to quit fentanyl repeatedly, even using the medication suboxone to to try to curb his opioid cravings, so far without success.  &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I wish I had the answer to that. I know all of us fighting addiction right now wish we had the answer," he said. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But many experts, activists and front-line healthcare workers say there's more hope on the streets, too. The spread of Narcan&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is helping. Researchers studying street drugs say the fentanyl being sold by dealers in the U.S. is less potent, less deadly, than it once was.  &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;That matters because studies show people who survive addiction long enough do typically recover.   &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are also growing efforts around the U.S. aimed at reaching young people experiencing severe addiction, programs that ramped up over the past four years with federal funding from the Biden administration.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On a recent afternoon, two city drug response workers in Philadelphia, Kevin Howard and Dominick Maurizio, offered counseling to a young man huddled in a bus shelter.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Anything we can help you with? Want to go in-patient?" Howard said. "Want to go to a shelter?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-70983" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Howard and Maurizio are themselves in recovery after surviving what they describe as their own battles with heroin and crack cocaine addiction when they were young men in their 20s.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Both said they believe this kind of outreach is helping. "If we help one person, we're winning in some capacity," Maurizio said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I see it as me saving lives," Howard said. "Any time I give someone Narcan or just check on them to see if they're alive, I believe we're winning."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But experts point to one other uncertainty in this first hopeful moment since the fentanyl crisis began. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration wants to cut billions of dollars in funding for science and health agencies responding to the fentanyl crisis. The federal government has already moved to freeze or end grants that support front-line drug treatment and harm reduction programs.  &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In a statement, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the goal is to "streamline resources and eliminate redundancies, ensuring that essential mental health and substance use disorder services are delivered more effectively."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/14/nx-s1-5361461/fentanyl-medicaid-addiction" target="_blank"&gt;doctors, researchers and harm reduction activists told NPR&lt;/a&gt; if addiction services are scaled back or shut down, the promising recovery among teens and young adults could unravel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;New research shows that people who take certain psychiatric medications may be more likely to develop &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALS"&gt;amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (ALS), which is the most common form of motor neurone disease (MND).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study, which was led by a team from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, raises some important questions about the connections between psychiatric symptoms, ALS, and MND, and how they might be targeted for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiolytic"&gt;Anxiolytics&lt;/a&gt;, hypnotics and sedatives, and antidepressants are the most commonly prescribed drugs for psychiatric disorders such as anxiety,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="163907" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, and sleep problems. In terms of increased ALS risk, it worked out as 34 percent, 21 percent, and 26 percent respectively for the three drug types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increased risk is extremely small when taken in context with the low prevalence of ALS itself. Yet understanding these links could help improve our understanding of motor neurone disease and provide insights for specialists prescribing ways to treat common psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In this case-control study, prescribed use of anxiolytics, hypnotics and sedatives, or antidepressants was associated with a higher subsequent risk of ALS," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.14437"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Prediagnostic use of such medications was also associated with a poor prognosis after ALS diagnosis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, there's no cure for the progressive debilitation that ALS causes, as parts of the nervous system break down – leading to paralysis and, eventually, respiratory failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also identified a slight increase in rate of decline and risk of an earlier death among those diagnosed with ALS who had been exposed to one of a number of psychiatric medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_163910" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-163910" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/DrugsChart.jpg" alt="Drugs vs ALS chart" class="wp-image-163910 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/DrugsChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/DrugsChart-279x415.jpg 279w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/DrugsChart-600x893.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-163910" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Medications such as anxiolytics (above) can also increase the risk of mortality or need for invasive ventilation in those diagnosed with ALS. (Chourpiliadis et al., &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used national health data in Sweden to compare 1,057 people with ALS who had been diagnosed between 2015 and 2023 with more than 5,000 controls matched for age and sex who had no MND diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also accounted for genetic and environmental factors in their analysis, further backing up the idea that the increased risk of ALS was connected to the medication – or the reasons the medications were prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The data isn't enough to show the drugs are directly causing the increase in ALS risk. It's also possible that other health-related factors are causing both the prescription of psychiatric medications, and the higher likelihood of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis"&gt;an ALS diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study adds to growing evidence that individuals with psychiatric conditions may face an elevated risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/motor-neurone-disease-linked-to-use-of-common-psychiatric-medications"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Susannah Tye, from the University of Queensland in Australia, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, the implication that psychiatric medications themselves contribute to this risk should be interpreted with caution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ana.24801"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; has found people with psychiatric disorders are also more at risk of developing ALS, these results may provide some much needed detail&lt;span&gt; to the overall picture of how these different conditions, and their causes and treatments, fit together.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that ALS remains a rare condition, affecting &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/als/dashboard/index.html"&gt;around 9 in 100,000 people&lt;/a&gt; in the US. Depression and anxiety are much more common, which means millions of people take these medications to treat their mental health without ever developing ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time though, scientists are gradually &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vigorous-physical-activity-linked-to-increased-risk-of-developing-als-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-mnd"&gt;understanding the different factors&lt;/a&gt; that affect ALS risk, which should provide clues as to how it might one day be effectively treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.14437"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Dementia cases are on the rise around the world. In 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia"&gt;57 million people&lt;/a&gt; were living with one of the neurodegenerative diseases under the dementia umbrella, and by 2050, that number is expected to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(21)00249-8"&gt;reach 153 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a new study suggests the tides may be turning, with younger generations facing lower risks for the disease as they age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by economist Xiaoxue Dou from the University of Queensland in Australia, ran a cross-sectional observational study using health survey data from the US, Europe and England: one that's representative of cross-sections of the populations involved at a single point in time, and based on observational data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers only used variables that were available across all the survey data to estimate participants' dementia status, to compensate for any missing observations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Birth cohorts born more recently were less likely to develop dementia in all three regions, albeit at different rates," the authors &lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.13384"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt; in a journal article. "This decreasing trend was more pronounced among women than men."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They particularly focused on people aged 71 years or older, with the data sorted into age groups spanning four years. Compared with the older groups, younger cohorts had lower age-specific dementia prevalence rates: 21.2 percent for those in the US study; 38.9 percent in the European study; and 28.3 percent in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For example, in the US, among people aged 81 to 85, 25.1 percent of those born between 1890-1913 had dementia, compared to 15.5 percent of those born between 1939-1943," economist and co-author Sabrina Lenzen of the University of Queensland &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/02/younger-generations-less-likely-dementia-study"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Nicola Davis at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team cautions their data may not accurately reflect what is happening in minority groups. But the findings suggest that, while aging populations globally will probably mean greater numbers of people living with dementia, the percentage of people affected may actually be decreasing, at least among the groups studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This generational decrease in dementia risk, the study's authors &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2834750?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=060225"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;, "has important implications for health care planning, long-term care policies, and workforce requirements in aging populations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2834750?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=060225"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He was unable to sit upright in a chair – instead slumping on the floor – and was in a state of complete and total confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tests showed the 21-year-old also had a racing heart and his blood pressure was high, at around 184/99 (a healthy reading should be no more than 120/80).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the mystery was soon solved when his brother, who’d accompanied him to hospital, revealed the patient had just spent 12 hours revising for an upcoming exam with the aid of a stimulant to keep him alert and boost his concentration: nicotine pouches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These are tiny, pillow-shaped packages containing synthetic nicotine powder and flavourings, which are becoming increasingly popular with young adults in the UK who want the buzz that comes from nicotine without the toxic harm of the tobacco in cigarettes, or the chemicals that can go into vapes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies suggest up to one in 50 people aged 18 to 24 in the UK are already using the pouches – while a survey by the Professional Footballers’ Association in 2024 revealed one in five players regularly use nicotine products such as pouches to help them stay mentally alert or to &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-13475635/The-truth-snus-one-five-footballers-putting-nicotine-pouches-mouths-experts-reveal-really-does-body.html"&gt;relax after training and matches&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Discreetly placed between the top lip and the gum, the pouches release a steady flow of addictive nicotine that’s absorbed into the bloodstream over a 20 to 60-minute period through the hundreds of tiny blood vessels in the tissue lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are different from snus – a teabag-style product that also sits in the mouth and releases nicotine but is made with tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Political commentator Tucker Carlson holds a pack of nicotine pouches at the Republican National Convention in Wisconsin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pouch fans claim a range of (some unproven) effects, from boosting powers of concentration, to curbing appetite to helping them relax. US TV host and political commentator Tucker Carlson, who last year launched his own brand of nicotine pouches, ALP, claims ‘it clears your thinking... and raises testosterone’. (Even the US secretary of health, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has been spotted apparently using a nicotine pouch.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, social media posts suggest young adults are using pouches to lose weight (with some saying that it’s a cheap alternative to the weight-loss injection Wegovy). Nicotine is well known to be an appetite suppressant and the pouches – costing as little as £4.99 for a tin of 20 from high street retailers – are considerably cheaper than buying weight-loss drugs online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nicotine has always been considered the innocent party in cigarettes’ damaging effect on human health. It’s addictive, yes, but compared to some of the cancer-inducing chemicals in cigarettes, it is relatively benign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the Toronto case shows it’s not completely harmless. Doctors found the patient had got through 15 pouches in a 12-hour period, flooding his system with high doses of nicotine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was kept in hospital for 24 hours and given powerful benzodiazepine drugs to calm his agitation, before making a full recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But medics were so concerned that they published a report last summer in the journal Nicotine and Tobacco Research, highlighting the potential risk – ‘this is the first case of acute nicotine toxicity from nicotine pouch use’, they wrote. ‘These pouches are emerging as a novel way to use nicotine but present a serious risk of inadvertent overdose and harm.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In January, the US Food and Drug Administration sanctioned the sale of Zyn – a nicotine pouch popular with those in their teens and 20s as a weight-loss aid – the first branded pouch to be &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-13430633/weight-loss-drug-shed-pounds-fast.html"&gt;approved there&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s marketed by Philip Morris International, the tobacco giant which has branched out into vapes and nicotine pouches as cigarette demand declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Professor of epidemiology John Britton says pouches are an excellent alternative for smokers looking to quit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And it’s not alone. British American Tobacco also has a pouch on the market called Velo, which comes in fruit and mint flavours, costing around £5 for 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Concerns about the pouches being a ‘gateway’ to smoking have led to them being &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-11856003/Calls-vape-sales-banned-Australia.html"&gt;banned in some countries, including France and the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;; in others, such as Australia, they’re available only on prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, because they do not contain tobacco, nicotine pouches can legally be sold to under-18s and are often &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-11716721/Teenagers-sold-banned-vaping-devices-containing-3-500-puffs-investigation-shows.html"&gt;placed near sweets in corner shops&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet, while an average cigarette has 10-12mg of nicotine, some pouches advertised in the UK have more than ten times as much, around 150mg – several times the amount permitted in e-cigarette liquids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The UK Tobacco and Vapes Bill is expected to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-9868699/Now-21s-BANNED-buying-cigarettes-flavoured-vapes.html"&gt;clamp down on sales of nicotine pouches and vapes to young people&lt;/a&gt; – but it’s not likely to take effect until January 2027. And some researchers have expressed alarm at how marketing for pouches is targeting young people on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts at Orebro University in Sweden studied nearly 500 Instagram posts from one popular UK brand – Nordic Spirit – between 2019 and 2023. Researchers concluded in a report, published in the journal Nordic Studies on Alcohol and Drugs in December 2024, that the posts were often misleading, underplayed the dangers of nicotine and framed the pouches as ‘trendy lifestyle products… rather than as an alternative to smoking’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They urged the Advertising Standards Authority to introduce tighter regulations to protect young people ‘from exploitation’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another study, by the University of British Columbia in Canada, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14107111/Doctors-warn-dangers-using-Zyn-favorite-celebs-favorite-nicotine.html"&gt;published in January in Nicotine and Tobacco Research&lt;/a&gt;, found TikTok videos promoting Zyn pouches as ‘fun and safe’ – rather than as a tool to stop smoking – and rarely mentioned the risks of nicotine addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Discreetly placed between the top lip and the gum, pouches release a steady flow of addictive nicotine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet evidence is emerging that the pouches may be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In March, experts at the University of Gothenburg reported that regular use can lead to painful gum ulcers and inflammation. Chronic exposure to a corrosive chemical, sodium carbonate – added to increase the absorption of nicotine – has been blamed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research is also emerging about the effects of nicotine – including the synthetic kind. Its effect on the brain is well known – within 20 seconds of inhaling it, it triggers the release of chemicals such as dopamine which is associated with pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it also increases heart rate, causes a spike in blood pressure and makes blood vessels constrict. This is because nicotine also triggers the release of the hormone adrenaline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And some experts fear nicotine could even have harmful neurological effects in young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Marina Picciotto, a neuroscientist at Yale University in the US, has been studying the impact that it can have on the developing brain – whether from smoking, vaping or pouches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told Good Health: ‘Nicotine gets to the brain from pouches and alters the signalling of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine [a chemical vital for learning and memory]. We know from studies of adolescent smoking that this can result in long-term changes in brain function and connectivity.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Indeed, a US study published in March in Substance Use and Misuse revealed that 14-year-olds who regularly used nicotine pouches were two-and-a-half times more likely to achieve poorer school grades than their peers who did not use them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers warned: ‘The brain is not fully developed in middle/high school students, therefore many substances, including nicotine, have the potential to affect it, impair learning and hinder academic performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Nicotine in pouches is an emerging, heavily marketed, explicit public health concern.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And there may be links with some types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Numerous studies show that nicotine can fuel the growth of pancreatic cancer cells in mice – though it’s not clear if it does the same in humans – while a mouse study published in April in the journal Acta Pharmacologica Sinica found that nicotine can cause mutations in a gene called EZH2, which increases the spread of non-small cell lung cancer (the most common type of lung cancer in the UK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;John Britton, a professor of epidemiology at Nottingham University and former chairman of the Royal College of Physicians Tobacco Advisory Group, says pouches are an excellent alternative for smokers wishing to quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told Good Health: ‘But if you don’t smoke, then why would you want to risk becoming addicted to nicotine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s true that it’s an appetite suppressant – that’s one of the reasons smokers who quit often gain weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But the effect is quite modest – and if you want to lose weight safely, it would be much better to do it by altering your diet.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A spokesman for British American Tobacco said it had repeatedly called on the UK Government to ban the sale of pouches to under 18s and introduce a cap on their nicotine content – adding: ‘We are disappointed it has taken them so long.’ Philip Morris International did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 01:00:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi3gFBVV95cUxNaXZ4MkQ3TUFvejdnOVAwVUJvaXgwSUE4SzJTSzdxeUN2WDA4SEItOW1ycE9ld3RnT0RhSllRNWdnV1htajRoSk5sQWYzTE1aSklIWllVQTNNY3ZZTWIzZ0lkNkVLQ2l0OHdrc2RQSk5nY0FLX3JYVkhKWW1VYUlaR1pOSldNRm43eFVUWVJhbmswcmprb0lkczFDbVl5emtBZEZRMi0zRzYtQXlfZ0R5anRSdW44aDVkZWRYVnJiY2YycC14RnpOTlg5OGRabDhkTVhWOHRHVi03Y01DYnc</guid></item><item><title>纳瓦霍县确诊四例麻疹病例，今年首次出现在亚利桑那州- ABC15亚利桑那州 | Four measles cases confirmed in Navajo County, first in Arizona this year -

If you believe you may have measles, contact your healthcare provider before visiting to avoid exposing others.&lt;br&gt;• No primary care provider? Call your nearest hospital emergency department or urgent care center before arriving.&lt;/p&gt;

However, histotripsy carries a lower risk of complications than ablation, in which liver tumours are destroyed by applying heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/scotland/article/shapeshifting-bowel-cancer-cells-key-to-treatment-breakthrough-kxdl0h29k" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shapeshifting bowel cancer cells key to treatment breakthrough&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The technology has been approved in the UK under the innovative devices access pathway, a process overseen by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

There are now about 6,000deaths each year. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has one of the lowest survival rates out of all cancer types and is showing one of the fastest increases in mortality.

By offering this non-invasive, more targeted treatment, we can care for more people as outpatients and free up time for surgeons to treat more complex cases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The installation of the UK’s first histotripsy system at Addenbrooke’s was supported by the Li Ka Shing Foundation, a long-standing backer of cancer research in Cambridge. The technology has been developed by the US company HistoSonics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Sinker added: “The faster recovery times mean patients will be able to return to their normal lives more quickly, which will also reduce pressure on hospital beds, helping us ensure that patients are able to receive the right treatment at the right time. We are delighted to be receiving this new state-of-the-art machine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Further studies are under way to explore histotripsy’s use in treating kidney and pancreatic cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Fiona Carey, who is a kidney cancer patient and co-chair of the patient advisory group for Cambridge Cancer Research Hospital, said: “This is seriously good news. A new, non-invasive option to treat these cancers is very welcome indeed.

The cause for the rise in such GI cancers needs more research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3e3054" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s likely that there are environmental causes, which include exposures to food, water and micro plastics or lifestyle or dietary changes,” said Cercek, who wasn’t involved with the new research. “You can’t really pin it down to one thing or another. It’s likely multiple factors causing this rise after 1945.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7e34ef" class="body-graf"&gt;The appendix is a small pouch that hangs off the large intestine on the lower right side of the abdomen. A blockage can lead to infection and inflammation, called appendicitis, which needs emergency treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eadb19" class="body-graf"&gt;Unlike other cancers of the GI tract, appendix cancers aren’t easily found because they’re not as easy to see on abdominal scans and won’t be picked up by colonoscopies, said Dr. Deborah Doroshow, an associate professor of medicine at the Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. “So it’s not easy to detect or screen for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d1ac1c" class="body-graf"&gt;In fact, Holowatyj said, about 95% of appendix cancers aren’t spotted until after a person has appendicitis and the appendix is removed and examined by pathologists. As a result, the cancers tend to be at a late stage with poorer long-term prognoses, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0a0b3c" class="body-graf"&gt;Doroshow, who wasn’t involved with the new study, said it’s important for patients and their doctors to be more aware of subtle symptoms. Symptoms such as changes in energy level, a new persistent pain or unexplained weight loss in a young person shouldn’t be ignored, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1c5821" class="body-graf"&gt;“If a person is feeling that something is not right it’s always best to get an opinion,” Doroshow said. “We’ve diagnosed young people with cancer whom other health care providers had not taken seriously because they were young.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-beccf5" class="body-graf"&gt;Women and people of color may find they need to advocate for themselves, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8a77ca" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Doroshow said people shouldn’t be worrying about every single abdominal pain. Rather, it’s persistent pain that would be a concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 22:16:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxNZWdvdmpOV1k5RGNQdnY4Z29yUFdIWVRwZ2FobnhLamdCdEs5cDNfN3FBZDliSU1JZUdsdFdMcEhMTU1BZXNmZGdDSVZ1U00wWWxlNVBVck1tYkFvdjM5cjlzU3JDS0YwMnhSMGphWjF3VlBxcExDQlNtYUdDUjZpckJBWXZXX3BnQUN2cU43ckNtdl9NUDJVRHdIb2s2UTc1di1PS9IBVkFVX3lxTE14N0M0RnVKQ2R5R0ZndWczSjRFa1Y0eUMzbDV5UWtlaThqNF9LOXlULTl3QzlTMlRmOV9WdlVUaHJRSGE0VnBWTFhtSWxGaDNYU3BaU0x3</guid></item><item><title>几种精神疾病具有相同的根本原因，研究结果- ScienceAlert | Several Psychiatric Disorders Share The Same Root Cause, Study Finds - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOSU1hOVpCMnNJOGlKWWl4Z3dzSlQ3c1B1dlVfeDhYZzRBalVkOUJ3YUoyRmJ3RVVra1RVNzRMWU1MVHE5Wkg3Qm1JbktjZkp5alRGVGN1SktsbHZod0F5WXlRWk5fTlJBYnRWMmpnVGZTbFJkVW1ZSTQ0akJ2VjdKN1dXSTFvRTdoaGtYdDRnUlZ5V1o1MHJESk9COGY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Researchers recently discovered that eight different psychiatric conditions share a common genetic basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published this year pinpointed specific variants among those shared genes and uncovered how they behave during brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US team found that many of these variants remain active for extended periods, potentially influencing multiple developmental stages – and offering new targets for treatments that could address several disorders at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The proteins produced by these genes are also highly connected to other proteins," &lt;a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/genetics/eight-psychiatric-disorders-share-the-same-genetic-causes-study-says/"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; University of North Carolina geneticist Hyejung Won. "Changes to these proteins in particular could ripple through the network, potentially causing widespread effects on the brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019 &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.11.020"&gt;an international team of researchers&lt;/a&gt; first identified 109 genes that were linked in different combinations with eight psychiatric disorders, including  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="164081" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="164081" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="164081" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, Tourette syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and anorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may explain why these conditions often co-occur – for example &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389%2Ffpsyt.2022.837424"&gt;up to 70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of individuals diagnosed with autism or ADHD have the other too  – and why they frequently cluster in families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_150776" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-150776" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/HumanPrecurserNeuronsDay11WithDifferentProteinMarkersStainedInRedAndGreen-e1738614042645-642x212.jpg" alt="These Eight Psychiatric Disorders Have a Surprising Genetic Connection" class="wp-image-150776 size-medium" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-150776" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Human precursor neurons with protein expression stained in different colors, indicating the type of neurons developing. (Won et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these eight conditions also has gene differences that are unique to them individually, so Won and team compared the unique genes with those shared between the disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They took almost 18,000 variations of the shared and unique genes involved and put them into the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"&gt;precursor cells&lt;/a&gt; that become our neurons to see how they could impact gene expression in these cells during human development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This allowed the researchers to identify 683 genetic variants that impacted gene regulation and to further explore them in neurons from developing mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic variants behind multiple seemingly unrelated traits, or in this case conditions, are called&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiotropy"&gt; pleiotropic&lt;/a&gt;. The pleiotropic variants were involved in many more protein-to-protein interactions than the gene variants unique to specific psychological conditions, and they were active across more types of brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164084" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164084" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-642x642.jpg" alt="Several Psychiatric Disorders Share The Same Root Cause, Study Finds" class="size-medium wp-image-164084" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-642x642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap-600x600.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164084" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;This simple genotype-phenotype map only shows additive pleiotropy effects.

The ability of these genes to impact cascades and networks of processes, such as gene regulation, could explain why the same variants can contribute to different conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pleiotropy was traditionally viewed as a challenge because it complicates the classification of psychiatric disorders," &lt;a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/genetics/eight-psychiatric-disorders-share-the-same-genetic-causes-study-says/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, if we can understand the genetic basis of pleiotropy, it might allow us to develop treatments targeting these shared genetic factors, which could then help treat multiple psychiatric disorders with a common therapy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would be a very useful strategy given the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-does-the-world-health-organisation-do" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73079" data-postid="164081" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; estimates 1 in 8 people (almost 1 billion in total) live with some form of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-disorders"&gt;psychiatric condition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.12.022"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was first published in February 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

She has a passion for painting and puzzles, an extended social network and an optimistic outlook. She “exemplifies healthy ageing”, Topol says, and he classifies her as one of the “wellderly”. In contrast, most people are the “illderly”; only about a quarter of people aged 65 to 74 in the UK have no diagnosed long-term health condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;div id="3.0"&gt;&lt;div id="e31bf542-9015-45ca-a887-0522c43e6266"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;The cardiologist Eric Topol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;CHARLIE NEUMAN/U-T SAN DIEGO/ZUMA/ALAMY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A professor at Scripps Research in San Diego, California, Topol, 70, has published a series of bestsellers on the future of medicine as well as more than 1,300 journal articles. For one research project he looked at 1,400 people who were aged 80-plus, had never been sick and had never had one of the big three chronic illnesses: cancer, heart disease and neurodegenerative disease. He found there was little in their DNA that accounted for their healthy ageing, but they were considerably thinner than their peers, exercised more, were better educated than the general population, and were upbeat and sociable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;One thing Topol says can’t be emphasised enough is that cancer and the major age-related diseases of the heart and brain can incubate for 20 years at least before revealing themselves clinically. Those years offer a great opportunity to work on preventing such illnesses. With that in mind, he has written a new book, &lt;i&gt;Super Agers&lt;/i&gt;, in which he lays out how to achieve one’s maximum health span — the number of years lived in optimal health — and shift from the illderly path to the wellderly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“You’re going to gain healthy ageing years by adopting these very important lifestyle changes,” Topol says. And the earlier you do so, “the more years of healthy ageing you gain”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Adopt an anti-ageing diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Topol is an advocate of the Mediterranean diet, which is high in vegetables, fruit and fibre. He hasn’t eaten red meat for years. “It’s pro-inflammatory, so if you’re going to have it, don’t make it a frequent thing,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He recommends using the app Open Food Facts to scan packets to identify ultra-processed foods (UPFs), which he says he is “religious” about avoiding. One day UPFs will be regarded in a similar way to cigarettes, he believes. “A lot of these are pro-inflammatory and they’ve been linked with all three major age-related diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/how-to-slow-ageing-top-tips-ways-slxs665g7" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to slow ageing: nine tips from a longevity expert&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;There is little evidence that intermittent fasting improves anti-ageing, and until there is more, his advice is to eat an early dinner and avoid consuming any more calories until breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He drinks a cup or two of coffee in the morning. “I don’t drink it because it’s going to improve healthy ageing, but that’s a bonus.” Observational studies have shown that there is an association between drinking coffee and lower risk of various cancers, cardiovascular disease, Parkinson’s and type 2 diabetes, although this could be linked to other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;You don’t need to be teetotal&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“I’ll have a glass or two of wine on weekend nights. That’s about it for me,” Topol says. The data is clear that anything more than moderate drinking (seven drinks a week for men; four to five for women) is not good for us. However, social engagement is important for healthy ageing and that often involves a drink. Topol’s best summary of the studies of light alcohol intake (a couple of drinks a week) is that it is not a problem, but the risk quickly increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Ditch the supplements &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;His patients often provide long lists of the supplements they’re taking. “I just shake my head. They’re wasting a lot of money.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3.16"&gt;&lt;div id="5c805ec1-bc59-49fb-9c68-b100e81032a5"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Richard Morgan, 93, on the rowing machine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;ROW2K.COM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;It’s never too late to start exercising&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Topol cites the case of Richard Morgan, a 93-year-old Irishman who had never exercised regularly before he reached his seventies, when he started using a rowing machine in his shed and then went on to win indoor rowing competitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Even walking briskly for just over an hour a day is associated with living for four and a half years longer than those who don’t exercise. Though it is important, if walking is your main exercise, that your heart rate is increased for a sustained period of 30 minutes or longer and you are not simply counting steps accrued during the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/science/article/anti-ageing-vaccine-is-closer-than-ever-but-what-helps-now-mvxfmh9q3" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anti-ageing vaccine is ‘closer than ever’ — but what helps now?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For years Topol emphasised to his patients the importance of aerobic exercise, but he has become convinced that preserving core strength is also vital. “In the past year-plus I’ve been very diligent about incorporating balance and strength training,” he says. Topol strength trains four times a week using resistance bands and exercises such as planks and lunges, as well as balance training and completing a similar number of sessions of aerobic exercise, such as walking, cycling and swimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He also tries to get outside regularly; a UK Biobank study found that long-term exposure to greenery where we live was associated with reduced anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Deep sleep matters &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;About seven hours of sleep is the optimal amount. Surprisingly, sleeping beyond seven hours may be associated with signs of cognitive and mental health decline, Topol says. There also appears to be a relationship between sleeping for more than eight hours and heightened all-cause morbidity — though Topol stresses that this is at a population level, and that some people perform better with eight or six hours’ sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Among the benefits of deep sleep, or non-rapid eye movement sleep, is that it helps to clear the brain of metabolic waste that may increase the risk of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Using a sleep tracker, Topol discovered that he was getting as little as 15 minutes a night of deep sleep. Some experts suggest we need one to two hours, but it depends on our age, Topol says. He increased his deep sleep to an hour a night by adopting a stricter bedtime routine, stopping exercising and eating late in the evenings, and hydrating earlier in the day so he didn’t wake to urinate. He is sceptical of sleep medications, some of which could make toxins in the brain more concentrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;The tests that could help you li&lt;b&gt;ve longer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Genome sequencing is underused, according to Topol, who says it is vital for identifying disease-causing genetic mutations in those with unknown illnesses (last week &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/science/article/david-cameron-dna-test-sick-children-build-register-mx5g5zf87" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;David Cameron called for all infants admitted to paediatric care to be tested for unusual genetic conditions&lt;/a&gt;). In some cases, a test to reveal disease-causing genes — particularly those associated with cancer — may cost only a few hundred pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/why-sitting-unhealthy-standing-how-to-stay-fit-zq8brhr5c" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why sitting for more than 60 hours a week is ageing you&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Polygenic-risk tests for specific diseases are also available for common cancers, heart disease and Alzheimer’s. They can be sought at private clinics and online and test a sample of saliva or blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Organ clocks, which measure proteins in the blood, can reveal which individual organs are ageing faster than the rest of the body. Studies have been carried out with UK Biobank participants, and Topol expects commercial tests will be available in the near future — and will eventually form a routine part of health assessments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;But don’t say yes to every test &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Topol is scornful of companies offering full MRI scans. “That’s completely off the rails,” he says. “The chance for harm is greater than the potential benefit.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Scans can also lead to unnecessary interventions. He has seen patients almost bleed to death from a liver biopsy or who suffered a collapsed lung “from a biopsy of an innocent nodule”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He is dismissive of Bryan Johnson, the Silicon Valley biohacker who is spending $2 million a year trying to reverse the ageing process, and of private clinics offering blood transfusions from young people at $8,000 a litre. “Ridiculous! We have longevity clinics that charge $250,000 a year. It’s reckless and predatory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Microbiome tests are popular, but Topol cautions that there isn’t a reliable commercial test yet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Beware of anti-ageing drugs &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He worries that not enough is being done to tackle serious threats to our lifespans, including environmental pollution, microplastics and “forever chemicals”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The jury is still out on some scientific advances, including much-hyped anti-ageing drugs. “Some are very effective in mice and rats, but rodents are not people,” he says. “There’s some very strong science that’s being pursued but there’s no guarantee we’re going to get there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;However, he is excited about where science is taking us. A company called Infinity Bio has developed a blood test that can determine a person’s exposure to more than 500 viruses. This may become commercially available in a year or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Ozempic could prevent diseases in old age &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Topol’s greatest enthusiasm is reserved for GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic, which he says may play a role in “the next frontier for medicine”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“These gut hormones that talk to the brain and talk to the immune system are going to be one of the most important groups of medicine going forward to help prevent the big three diseases — cancer, cardiovascular, neurodegenerative — and we have trials for Alzheimer’s ongoing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He is not overly concerned about the side-effects. “Gastrointestinal side-effects usually dissipate in the first few weeks. The side-effect of muscle mass loss in people who are obese can be countered by resistance training.” But he does have one reservation: he is not a fan of people having to take drugs for the rest of their lives. “It would be nice if we had a weaning strategy, and the companies don’t appear to have any interest in that.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Super Agers by Eric Topol (Simon &amp;amp; Schuster £22).

Rates among older millennials, born in the 1980s, were more than four times higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Even with those increases, appendix cancer still remains extremely rare. Doctors diagnose an &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39979656/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;estimated 3,000 new cases&lt;/a&gt; in the United States each year, compared with more than 150,000 cases of colon and rectal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The findings come at a time of growing concern about the earlier onset of certain cancers, including colorectal, breast and kidney cancers. The new research describes what’s known as a “birth cohort” effect, or a disease becoming more common among successive generations. Such an effect lends credence to the idea that people born after a certain time have had similar exposures to something that is increasing their cancer risk more so than among people born decades before, said Dr. Andrea Cercek, a medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;And the fact that researchers have seen similar generational effects in colorectal and gastric cancers suggests there may be some shared risk factors between those cancers and appendix cancer, said Dr. Andrew T.

A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38844692/" target="_blank"&gt;study last year&lt;/a&gt; looked at how temperature impacted mortality among the homeless in counties surrounding Los Angeles and Las Vegas between 2015 and 2022. It found that nearly half the deaths of homeless people in the Las Vegas area in that period were attributable to heat, and about 5 percent in the Los Angeles area were — “orders of magnitude greater” than in the general population, the study said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YKLI7XUYRZH7XHJZ5JS5M6FOEE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Weckstein, who will soon start her residency in internal medicine at the University of California at San Francisco, said she wants to be a practitioner working mostly with homeless individuals. She noted the need for more affordable housing and better access to shelters and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2023/07/15/cooling-centers-limitations-heatwaves-cities/"&gt;cooling centers&lt;/a&gt;. Her research “points to the disproportionate impact of climate change on vulnerable groups,” she said, “and the need for policies that protect those at greatest risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 20:16:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxQdG9Fb3BESEdZTFJneUlIU21yZ2ZSTFR5WUxENTFpRU5Ka0ROWEhUOWpXMzk0WVFaRTluV2cxcFcxRWUyczBrMjFYVTBMVEljWnM5NWdqNmRWZTQ1d0ZRdHlhQnFMdzBLWDV0dnk1U1JXVm42WndGcjVQOTZuY1Q0NS14SnFEV294VHR4bzF1YTBfaXNrNVFXeXJ3</guid></item><item><title>流行的糖替代品赤藓糖醇可能会损害脑血管健康，研究发现- PsyPost | Popular sugar substitute erythritol may impair brain blood vessel health, study finds - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxOMHRER0VSaFFWSFhYcGVDcDdPZ0g0NzA3bUxPU2FoUnhqTmpOMFN6QnZzYURyOHNJcTlGMjVBNTBlb3d6X1Y2YU1HQ0ZsckIxb3cwS012SWpzQ0lUd1FUaVpLV29GY0dNcDZrclBhTngxQkE2OU5oS3VoUHk4VzA2Y2Z3SkVSYndpSFlVWXNHZ3F1a0hYZEhTOENsMWQzVlhmSUpaVUU4aGFWcFNXOGc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; suggests that erythritol, a popular sugar substitute, may negatively affect the cells lining blood vessels in the brain. In laboratory experiments, researchers found that erythritol increased oxidative stress, disrupted nitric oxide production, promoted the release of a blood vessel-constricting compound, and impaired the release of a key clot-busting protein. These changes are all associated with a higher risk of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol is widely used as a low-calorie sweetener. It is found in many “sugar-free” or “keto” products, including soft drinks, baked goods, and candies. Because it has minimal impact on blood sugar and insulin, erythritol has been promoted as a healthier alternative to sugar for people with obesity, diabetes, or metabolic syndrome. It is naturally present in small amounts in fruits and vegetables and can also be produced in the body. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved erythritol for use as a food additive in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But concerns about erythritol’s effects on cardiovascular health have been rising. A 2023 study by Witkowski and colleagues reported that higher levels of erythritol in the blood were linked to a greater risk of heart attack and stroke over a three-year period. This association held true across sexes and across populations in the United States and Europe. The same research group also found that drinking a beverage containing erythritol led to increased platelet reactivity—a potential contributor to blood clots. Other studies have similarly noted a possible link between erythritol and heart-related health risks. However, until now, there has been limited direct evidence on how erythritol affects blood vessel function at the cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this gap, researchers in the new study examined how erythritol influences brain microvascular endothelial cells, which line the small blood vessels in the brain and help regulate blood flow. These cells also play a role in controlling inflammation, preventing clot formation, and maintaining the blood-brain barrier. When they become dysfunctional, the risk of stroke and other brain disorders can increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used an in vitro model, meaning they grew human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells in the lab and exposed them to erythritol. The dose they used—6 millimolar—was equivalent to the amount of erythritol found in a typical artificially sweetened beverage, or about 30 grams. The cells were exposed to erythritol for three hours, after which various markers of cell function were measured. These included oxidative stress levels, nitric oxide and endothelin-1 production, and the ability of cells to release tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), a protein that helps dissolve blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results revealed several concerning changes. First, the erythritol-treated cells produced significantly more reactive oxygen species—compounds that can damage cells and are a key sign of oxidative stress. Specifically, cells exposed to erythritol showed about a 75% increase in reactive oxygen species compared to untreated cells. This rise in oxidative stress was accompanied by an increase in antioxidant proteins like superoxide dismutase-1 and catalase, suggesting that the cells were attempting to counteract the harmful effects of the stress but were not able to fully do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers examined nitric oxide production. Nitric oxide is a molecule produced by blood vessel cells that helps keep blood vessels open and maintains healthy blood flow. While the overall level of the enzyme responsible for nitric oxide production—endothelial nitric oxide synthase—did not change, the activation of this enzyme was significantly reduced in erythritol-treated cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, one form of activation, called phosphorylation at Ser1177, dropped by about 65%, while an inhibitory modification, phosphorylation at Thr495, increased by roughly 85%. As a result, nitric oxide production dropped by about 20%. Reduced nitric oxide availability is a hallmark of endothelial dysfunction and is linked to increased risk of stroke and other cardiovascular events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the study found an increase in the production of endothelin-1, a peptide that causes blood vessels to constrict. Levels of its precursor, Big ET-1, were significantly higher in erythritol-treated cells, and the amount of endothelin-1 released into the surrounding environment was about 30% higher. Elevated endothelin-1 can lead to excessive narrowing of blood vessels and impair cerebral blood flow, especially during times of increased demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final part of the study looked at the cells’ ability to release t-PA, a protein that helps dissolve blood clots and is essential for preventing stroke. While baseline t-PA levels were similar between treated and untreated cells, the erythritol-treated cells failed to increase their t-PA output in response to thrombin, a compound that normally triggers clot-busting activity. In contrast, untreated cells showed a robust increase in t-PA release. This suggests that erythritol impairs the cells’ ability to respond to clot-promoting conditions, potentially weakening the body’s natural ability to prevent strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the findings point to a concerning pattern. Erythritol exposure increased oxidative stress, reduced nitric oxide availability, increased production of a vessel-constricting compound, and blunted the release of a key clot-dissolving enzyme. All of these changes are well-established features of cerebrovascular dysfunction and are known contributors to the development and severity of ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While erythritol is widely used in sugar-free products marketed as healthier alternatives, more research is needed to fully understand its impact on vascular health,” said Auburn Berry, a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder and first author of the study, in a news release. “In general, people should be conscious of the amount of erythritol they are consuming on a daily basis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the researchers caution that the study was conducted in vitro and cannot directly predict how erythritol will affect brain blood vessels in a living person. The experimental model used isolated human endothelial cells and tested only a single, acute exposure. Real-world effects might depend on the dose, frequency, and duration of erythritol consumption, as well as individual health factors. Still, the study’s findings align with recent clinical and epidemiological research linking erythritol consumption to increased cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to determine whether repeated or long-term exposure to erythritol produces similar effects in living organisms, including humans. Future studies should also explore whether other non-nutritive sweeteners have similar impacts on endothelial health, and whether certain populations may be more vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025" target="_blank"&gt;The Non-Nutritive Sweetner Erythritol Adversely Affects Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cell Function&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Auburn R.

That is why we wanted to make people aware that rabies in animals is still occurring.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="photo-inline-"&gt;                      &lt;div class="img-container picture "&gt;            &lt;picture&gt;                                                &lt;source srcset="https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/local/e85567/picture181706946/alternates/FREE_1140/GettyImages-483873933" media="(min-width: 992px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/local/e85567/picture181706946/alternates/FREE_960/GettyImages-483873933" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/local/e85567/picture181706946/alternates/FREE_768/GettyImages-483873933" media="(min-width: 601px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/local/e85567/picture181706946/alternates/FREE_640/GettyImages-483873933" media="(min-width: 441px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/local/e85567/picture181706946/alternates/FREE_480/GettyImages-483873933" media="(min-width: 320px)"&gt;                                                &lt;img class="responsive-image" srcset="https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/local/e85567/picture181706946/alternates/FREE_1140/GettyImages-483873933" alt="The SLO County Public Health Department is warning residents to avoid any contact with bats after three tested positive for rabies as of June 2025." title="GettyImages-483873933" loading="lazy"&gt;                            &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;                            &lt;figcaption&gt;                                            The SLO County Public Health Department is warning residents to avoid any contact with bats after three tested positive for rabies as of June 2025.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study to look at why long-lived bats do not get cancer has broken new ground about the biological defenses that resist the disease.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59403-z" target="_blank"&gt;Reporting&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt;, a University of Rochester research team has found that four common species of bats have superpowers allowing them to live up to 35 years, which is equal to about 180 human years, without cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vera Gorbunova, Ph.D., and Andrei Seluanov, Ph.D., members of the UR Department of Biology and Wilmot Cancer Institute, led the work. Their key discoveries about how bats prevent cancer include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bats and humans have a gene called p53, a tumor-suppressor that can shut down cancer. (Mutations in p53, limiting its ability to act properly, occur in about half of all human cancers.) A species known as the "little brown" bat—found in Rochester and upstate New York—contains two copies of p53 and has elevated p53 activity compared to humans. High levels of p53 in the body can kill &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/cancer+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer cells&lt;/a&gt; before they become harmful in a process known as apoptosis. If levels of p53 are too high, however, this is bad because it eliminates too many cells. But bats have an enhanced system that balances apoptosis effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An enzyme, telomerase, is inherently active in bats, which allows their cells to proliferate indefinitely. This is an advantage in aging because it supports tissue regeneration during aging and injury. If cells divide uncontrollably, though, the higher p53 activity in bats compensates and can remove cancerous cells that may arise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bats have an extremely efficient immune system, knocking out multiple deadly pathogens. This also contributes to bats' anti-cancer abilities by recognizing and wiping out cancer cells, Gorbunova said. As humans age, the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/immune+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; slows, and people tend to get more inflammation (in joints and other organs), but bats are good at controlling inflammation, too. This intricate system allows them to stave off viruses and age-related diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;How does bat research apply to humans?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer is a multistage process and requires many "hits" as normal cells transform into &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/malignant+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;malignant cells&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, the longer a person or animal lives, the more likely cell mutations occur in combination with external factors (exposures to pollution and poor lifestyle habits, for instance) to promote cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One surprising thing about the bat study, the researchers said, is that bats do not have a natural barrier to cancer. Their cells can transform into cancer with only two "hits"—and yet because bats possess the other robust tumor-suppressor mechanisms described above, they survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the authors said, they confirmed that increased activity of the p53 gene is a good defense against cancer by eliminating cancer or slowing its growth. Several &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/anti-cancer+drugs/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;anti-cancer drugs&lt;/a&gt; already target p53 activity and more are being studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safely increasing the telomerase enzyme might also be a way to apply their findings to humans with cancer, Seluanov added, but this was not part of the current study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gorbunova is the Doris Johns Cherry professor of Biology and Medicine, and leads the Rochester Aging Research Center at the UR Medical Center. Seluanov is a Dean's professor of Biology and Medicine, and co-leads the Aging Center. Together, they have built outstanding careers studying the characteristics of long-lived mammals such as &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/naked+mole+rats/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;naked mole rats&lt;/a&gt; and bowhead whales that age well and resist serious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also study long-lived humans in collaboration with other institutions, investigating cohorts of people with exceptional longevity to discover which genes and epigenetic factors are overrepresented in these individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

The studies, which reported data from 142,171 long-COVID patients aged 36 to 86 years (87% men), were conducted in Bulgaria, China, Japan, Italy, Romania, and the United States. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;&lt;span&gt;All but one study focused on COVID-19 patients hospitalized in 2020; the other involved non-hospitalized patients. The authors reported the findings late last week in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Journal of Medical Virology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased risk of death at 3 years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The proportion of COVID-19 survivors reporting one or more persistent symptoms at 3 years was 20% (shortness of breath, 12%; fatigue, 11%; insomnia, 11%; loss of smell or taste, 7% each; and anxiety, 6%). Lingering signs of impaired lung function included poor diffusion capacity (42%) and low forced expiratory volume in 1 second (10%).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The need for researchers to report on the proportion of patients with long COVID who have been able to return to their original job 3 years later cannot be overemphasized.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hospitalized COVID-19 patients were at increased risk for death at 3 years (incidence rate ratio, 1.29; excess burden per 1,000 persons: 8.16). Death rates were also higher in those with and without neurologic signs at 3 years (58 of 414 [14.0%] and 94/1,196 [7.8%], respectively).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Among both nonhospitalized and hospitalized patients, long COVID contributed 9.6 and 90.0 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per 1,000 people in the third year post-infection, respectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although long-COVID symptoms in general waned among hospitalized patients over time, a substantial burden of new or persistent symptoms remained at 3 years. Of the eight major observed physiologic clusters (neurologic, mental, pulmonary, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, kidney, gastrointestinal, and metabolic), neurologic, pulmonary, and cardiovascular symptoms were the most prevalent. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Neurologic symptoms such as impaired memory, dizziness, and peripheral neuropathy were common, along with fatigue, mental conditions such as anxiety and depression, lung signs and symptoms such as shortness of breath and reduced lung function, and cardiovascular complications such as heart failure and abnormal heart rhythms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We are unable to report on the pooled prevalence regarding return to work due to lack of adequate data," the researchers wrote. "The need for researchers to report on the proportion of patients with long COVID who have been able to return to their original job 3 years later cannot be overemphasized."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need for multidisciplinary care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Risk factors for long-term symptoms included older age, more severe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="DA"&gt; COVID-19 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and hospitalization, female sex, smoking, substance use, allergy, and underlying medical conditions such as congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our findings confirm the persistence of unresolved symptoms 3 years post-COVID-19 infection, with implications for future research, healthcare policy, and patient care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Overall, these findings highlight the lasting impact of COVID-19 on mortality and disability up to 3 years after infection, particularly among individuals who required hospitalization and those who experienced neurological complications," the study authors wrote. "The evidence underscores the need for ongoing monitoring, support, and targeted interventions for affected individuals, especially those with severe or complex post-acute presentations." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They also noted the similarities with persistent symptoms after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;&lt;span lang="RU"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even 15 years after SARS epidemic in 2003, 38% of infected patients still had reduced lung diffusion capacity," the researchers wrote.

"Moreover, public health campaigns are vital to raise awareness, reduce stigma, and foster informed patient engagement."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Here’s how to know when a lack of appetite may be harmful and how to help bring it back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="3BOEHFR7XNHODDFOHQRLSIGSBU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="3BOEHFR7XNHODDFOHQRLSIGSBU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Why you feel less hungry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="A4ALIDFWL5BA5KVSQA3A5LC2IA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;How appetite works isn’t well understood, but scientists know that the brain and the digestive, endocrine and nervous systems all play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3FSNEKKMZ5AMXN7N2EBVD2TBDA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For example, metabolism slows with age, and that can make food less interesting. Your sense of taste or smell may diminish, and that can affect your appetite, too. Hormonal shifts may dampen the desire to eat and make you feel fuller when you do. Also, “life events,” Hickson says, such as retirement, loss of a job or the loss of a partner who did the cooking, “can trigger changes in what people eat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XNJADEDNSZGALEANSCTPHDOSEM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In some cases, the problem may not be related to the desire to eat but to difficulty eating. For example, saliva production can decrease because of age or a medication you’re taking (such as common ones for high blood pressure, an overactive bladder and depression). This can make food taste drier and harder to swallow. Tooth decay, poorly fitting dental work and jaw problems can lead to trouble chewing. And having little appetite may be a sign of some illnesses, such as an underactive thyroid or cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RLSBCAXKENDTFGSBNY5KL7QAME" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A prolonged lack of appetite and unintentional weight loss aren’t a normal part of aging, says Leah Cahill, an associate professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. See your doctor if the following signs last longer than a week: You’re skipping more meals, passing up formerly favorite foods, eating only a few bites at a meal or feeling nauseous at the thought of food. &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/dieting-weight-loss/how-to-lose-weight-safely-a7419492212/" target="_blank"&gt;Losing weight&lt;/a&gt; without trying over a six-month span should also trigger a health-care visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="LRCRTE43HJAIBATVAKDS3ECM6Q" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="LRCRTE43HJAIBATVAKDS3ECM6Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What happens when you don’t eat enough&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DAR2LAOJUNAGFBA5WYWX4MCBVU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Taking in fewer calories can cause weight and muscle loss, which can zap energy and affect balance and strength. It also makes it hard to get the vitamins, minerals and other nutrients you need. “The body requires nutrients for its basic functions, and not getting enough food can cause your body systems to weaken and not work as they should,” Cahill says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MKUXXV5D2NBU7ODOZLXWULFDEU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Frailty is another consequence, according to a &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.14283/jfa.2022.14" target="_blank"&gt;2022 international task force report&lt;/a&gt; on appetite loss and aging. Frailty, characterized by weight loss, weakness, being less physically active, exhaustion and cognitive decline, can make you more vulnerable to illness and falls, and to having worse outcomes when those occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="B2JTD6U2KFFFJCSPAD63E4OPUA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="B2JTD6U2KFFFJCSPAD63E4OPUA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Tips to boost appetite&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MVY6BVHZF5E4FPAEGD7YX3SJSU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In general, diet and lifestyle changes are preferred over prescription appetite stimulants because the latter don’t help much and have side effects. Forcing food on yourself isn’t a good move, either, because it can make you queasy, Hickson says. Instead, try the following strategies to help you improve your appetite and stay healthy:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ID6TAORWYJCUTA6KYVRLA2HVGA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Switch to mini-meals.&lt;/b&gt; Can’t manage a full meal? “Start with a smaller portion size of everything you would normally eat or have a goal of eating half of everything on your plate,” says Jen Bruning, a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Or try having three smaller meals plus three snacks, Hickson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QDV6EO6L7VFJVBYK6NENLXDJRI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prioritize protein.&lt;/b&gt; It’s important for building and preserving muscle. It also helps fight infection and maintain skin elasticity, so “get some protein on the plate with every meal,” Bruning says. And to make sure you get it in, eat it first in case you get too full before you finish your meal. Eggs, cottage cheese, yogurt, fish, tofu, chicken and other lean meats, legumes and nut butters (almond, peanut, cashew) are all good sources. If you have trouble getting enough protein from food alone, having a protein drink (such as Ensure) or adding a scoop of protein powder to smoothies might be appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="I4MA35GXTFHV5MGMJMJNCKQXR4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pair fruits and veggies with a dip.&lt;/b&gt; Any kind of produce makes a nutrient-rich snack. But fruits and vegetables are low in calories and quite filling. To get more of the vitamins, minerals and calories you need, serve them with nutritious higher-calorie dips, such as nut butters, full-fat yogurt, hummus or guacamole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NJQATR3DDJCMLFKLJMDNO7U5BI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Drink water between — not with — meals.&lt;/b&gt; You need to stay hydrated, but water can take up room in your stomach. As a result, you may leave too much food on your plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GBDBX2KYNJF23J3POM5W5X3NFM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Indulge in full-fat foods&lt;/b&gt;. Fat is the most concentrated source of calories, and older adults — especially those over 75 — can afford to carry a bit more weight, Hickson says. So it’s okay to have full-fat milk, cheese and yogurt, and butter on your toast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PLCSRIC2XFECVDWDKYHOFCECJI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use herbs and spices liberally.&lt;/b&gt; They add flavor to food, and the aroma as they cook can be an appetite stimulant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="L2W32FLWPFFNBLJPAAYI2HFMFY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eat with others when you can.&lt;/b&gt; Research shows that you might eat less if you eat alone and that having company might increase your intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="BSXJH3FN4NHH5BS25ATLSDETAA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="BSXJH3FN4NHH5BS25ATLSDETAA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Little meals that pack a big nutrition punch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TSNRRA5IMRBGZP6QMTLIAOBG4M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;On average, moderately active men over age 50 require 2,200 to 2,400 calories per day to get the fuel and nutrients they need, while women of a similar age and activity level need 1,800 calories. If you’re not feeling very hungry, it can be tough to eat that much food. One solution is to have smaller portions spread out throughout the day and to ensure the food you eat is full of nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O4UPBULSNFAWXK2V7MVREEVM7Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Here’s an example of what a healthy daily menu containing about 2,000 calories might look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7RWJKTDTAZADDOGEHJNC2KJA5Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Breakfast.&lt;/b&gt; Soft Taco Scramble: Scramble 1 egg and 2 egg whites with Monterey Jack cheese and ½ cup of fresh baby spinach.

              &lt;p&gt;Your zip code may shape your aging brain’s health. New research out today shows that people’s odds of being diagnosed with dementia differ significantly across different parts of the U.S.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of California, San Francisco, led the study, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2834952"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Monday in JAMA Neurology. They analyzed the medical records of veterans, finding that dementia rates were noticeably higher in the Southeast, Northwest, and other regions, even after accounting for some possible factors like income. The findings suggest that deep-seated regional differences can contribute to dementia risk, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dementia is a growing public health issue, particularly among the elderly. More than 6 million Americans are living with dementia currently and a government-funded study this February &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/risk-future-burden-dementia-united-states"&gt;projected&lt;/a&gt; that 42% of Americans over 55 will develop it in their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a complex condition, with most cases caused by a mix of environmental and/or genetic factors. But according to senior study author and neurologist Kristine Yaffe, there’s been little research looking at how the risk of dementia can vary geographically, at least on a national level. Yaffe and her team had access to a dataset that had the potential to shed light on that: deidentified records from people enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration, the largest integrated healthcare system in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“We realized the VA national data would allow for such an investigation as the VA has a uniform way of capturing data across the U.S.,” Yaffe, who is also chief of neuropsychiatry at the San Francisco VA healthcare system, told Gizmodo in an email. “There are no other national healthcare systems that have this.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yaffe’s team studied the health of more than 1.2 million randomly selected VA patients 65 years and older who had no pre-existing dementia. These people were followed for an average length of 12 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After adjusting for age, dementia rates were lowest in the Mid-Atlantic region, covering states like Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia. Using this as a baseline, the researchers found that dementia rates were 25% higher in the Southeast (Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama); 23% higher in both the Northwest (Idaho, Oregon, and Washington) and the Rocky Mountains (Colorado, Montana, and the Dakotas); 18% higher in the South (Texas, New Mexico, and Louisiana); 13% higher in the Southwest (California, Nevada, and Arizona); and 7% in the Northeast (New York).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This is a very large difference, especially given that these are all veterans with care at the VAHS,” Yaffe said. “It was really surprising we saw such big differences.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers reasoned that factors such as a person’s average level of education, how rural a state was, or the rate of other health conditions like heart disease within these states might explain most of the variance they found. But even when they adjusted for these variables, the patterns barely budged at all. That could mean there are other reasons—reasons not so easily captured through medical records alone—why someone in New Jersey will tend to have a lower risk of dementia than a similar person in Kentucky.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“It’s possible that the differences are explained by lifelong differences in things like education quality (vs quantity) and social determinants of health might be driving some of the differences,” Yaffe said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings now leave open more questions to be answered, which the team plans to start digging into.

Merck said in a release that it expects orders for the shot to begin in July, with shipments delivered before the virus starts to spread widely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approval gives doctors a new option for tackling the virus, which causes thousands of deaths among older Americans and hundreds of deaths among infants each year. Complications from RSV are the leading cause of hospitalization among newborns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are committed to ensuring availability of [Enflonsia] in the U.S. before the start of the upcoming RSV season to help reduce the significant burden of this widespread seasonal infection on families and health care systems," Dr. Dean Li, president of Merck Research Laboratories, said in a release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merck's shot will compete against a similar blockbuster treatment from Sanofi and AstraZeneca called Beyfortus, which was in short supply nationwide during the 2023 RSV season due to unprecedented demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both are preventative monoclonal antibodies, which deliver antibodies directly into the bloodstream to provide immediate protection. But each targets a different part of the virus, making it difficult to compare them directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merck's shot can be administered to infants regardless of their weight, which the company said may offer convenience in terms of dosing. Meanwhile, the recommended dosage of Beyfortus is based on an infant's body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanofi on Monday &lt;a href="https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2025/2025-06-09-05-00-00-3095598" target="_blank"&gt;revealed &lt;/a&gt;an aggressive effort to increase supply of Beyfortus, including a plan to begin shipping the shot early in the third quarter. Last year, Beyfortus booked sales of €1.7 billion ($1.8 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines for RSV are also available in the U.S. from companies such as &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-7"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/PFE/"&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-8"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/GSK/"&gt;GSK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-9"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/MRNA/"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. But those shots are only for use in adults or in pregnant women.

The shot also reduced lower respiratory infections that required medical attention by more than 60% compared with a placebo through five months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RSV is a common cause of lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNBC</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 19:30:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPRVhrOUVhUVZwNFJsTFJ3THM1VldHNUI2cW1SejVjS19udi1mYklQVVZhS1hCZzZnX3FqNThOWG53Q0lPN3ZwUW5wMEVGdDRNczNUWExvQm1sdzgxWUU4bzM2OTBuOGlFWml4R00xd29yZmFVTG05Z1A5djR6SjJ2Y0UycWRLUWdfMkVnNS1kYllweG45aW1TLVl2UFBMSVZHUGs0WXhqQdIBrAFBVV95cUxOQUM1eXNNZTBuNi1pTkctXzBUUzItb3hRekFCNVZQODZ5Ql9RRjRLT2VUZ2JDR1lWcUNNRTNyYjBKdko0WkE5OUI1UlRDeUVPbXZNblg5cUhWMWxPbDBCTGdJUkdSTzBPa1hOUE9TczNyc1Bfcmo0U1YzOG1nUjdFT0lwUUNMN216X1l0bjlHeHdIU3Nhc3l2ck5UOWd2YkZvNnZmQzRqR2psbllf</guid></item><item><title>什么是TRT ？专家讨论男性“绝经期”以及如何安全地治疗低睾酮-《纽约邮报》 | What is TRT?

&lt;p&gt;There’s no denying it. RJK Jr. has explored a few controversial ideas, particularly in the health and wellness sector. But, regardless of where you stand on his views, one thing is hard to deny.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking back at those viral videos of him &lt;a href="https://www.insideedition.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-says-he-is-not-on-steroids-credits-testosterone-replacement-and-fitness-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;pumping weights&lt;/a&gt; at Gold’s Gym back in 2023, he was in phenomenal shape for a man his age — biceps bulging, chest chiseled, pecks defined. He could have been an amateur bodybuilder. For a nearly 70-year-old, he was &lt;em&gt;ripped&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the videos surfaced, rumors began buzzing that Kennedy was on steroids. He promptly denied it, instead crediting his disciplined 35-minute workout routine. There was one other thing he mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I take testosterone replacement, which are appropriate to my age, and then I take a big fistful of nutrients,” he explained in an &lt;a href="https://www.insideedition.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-says-he-is-not-on-steroids-credits-testosterone-replacement-and-fitness-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with Newsmax.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hormonal changes associated with menopause are not so secret. Women are warned about hot flashes, mood swings, and decreased periods — all of which have been studied and scrutinized for as long as most of us can remember. But &lt;em&gt;Man-opause&lt;/em&gt;? Until recently, it has remained a blind spot in the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The age-related decline in testosterone levels, sometimes called Andropause — or “Manopause” colloquially — has often been met with more questions than answers.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Emerging research has begun to spark conversations around male aging and hormonal health. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17062768/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology revealed that testosterone levels in American men have dropped about 1% per year since the 1980s. The decline can not be attributed to aging alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;






	&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Some endocrinologists have studied the root causes, suspecting the decline is due to the increase in ultra-processed foods, pesticides, as well as drug use, and other environmental concerns. Others are focused on the best ways to raise levels back to the normal range.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For people like Deep Patel, co-founder of the telehealth company &lt;a data-nyp-link-source="trackonomics" data-nyp-affiliate="true" href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/nypost_01638_nypost?p=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2Fshopping%2Fwhat-is-trt%2F&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fshareasale.com%2Fr.cfm%3Fb%3D999%26u%3D3001441%26m%3D162919%26afftrack%3Dnyp-FF-TXL-whatistrt%26urllink%3Dulo.co%2Fproducts%2Ftestosterone-replacement-therapy&amp;amp;author=Miska%20Salemann&amp;amp;articleID=35941372&amp;amp;event_type=click&amp;amp;publishdate=june%209%2C%202025&amp;amp;linksource=web&amp;amp;primarytag=testosterone&amp;amp;contentsection=shopping" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Ulo&lt;/a&gt;, the statistic was a catalyst for exploring Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT) as a potential solution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s like the male version of menopause, except no one acknowledged it until recently,” Patel told the New York Post. “And look, the data backs this up. Endocrinologists have documented a population-wide decrease in testosterone levels over the past few decades. It’s not just in people’s heads.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Testosterone levels typically begin to decline when men reach their forties, at which point, some will start to experience a range of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15603-low-testosterone-male-hypogonadism" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, everything from hair loss and lowered libido to decreased muscle mass and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of these changes are to be expected, but others can reveal a larger condition, hypogonadism. Men with particularly low levels of testosterone — “Low T,” as the guys say — could also suffer from &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/shopping/best-erectile-dysfunction-treatments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;erectile dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;, osteoporosis, and even infertility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To determine whether levels are healthy or low, men can take a TRT test. These blood tests, typically administered in the morning when levels peak, examine the amount of the male hormone present in the blood. The &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/tests/testosterone" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;normal range&lt;/a&gt; is considered to be anywhere between 300 and 1,000 nanograms per deciliter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For men outside the normal range, some Doctors recommend trying TRT, the routine that RFK Jr. and millions of others have embraced as part of their anti-aging and health protocols. On TikTok, the tag “&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/trt-before-and-after?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;TRT Before and After&lt;/a&gt;” has amassed thousands of videos and millions of views showcasing brawny men flexing their quads and joking about their sudden burst of energy and newfound sex drives. Unlike Kennedy, many of these men are still young, in their twenties and thirties.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TRT has become more accessible through providers and online TRT companies like Ulo, but it’s essential to recognize that it’s only &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-fda-cautions-about-using-testosterone-products-low-testosterone-due" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;FDA-approved&lt;/a&gt; for specific conditions, such as hypogonadism or diminished functional activity of the gonads. TRT is not FDA-approved for men with low levels due to aging or other non-medical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Medical experts still have varying opinions on treatment. Some believe that the “normal range” does not sufficiently identify men who could benefit from TRT. Others take a more conservative approach, warning that the potential side effects outweigh the benefits and that TRT should be reserved for men with particularly low levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is testosterone declining in America?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Testosterone levels have declined substantially over the last couple of decades, and experts believe several factors may be contributing to these changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Right now, testosterone is declining in American men of all age groups, young and old. No one is talking about that,” shared Dr. Michael Aziz, the author of “&lt;a data-aps-asc-tag="nypost-20" data-aps-asin="0757325149" data-wrapped-template="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url" href="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAgeless-Revolution-Hallmarks-Defeating-Reversing%2Fdp%2F0757325149%3Ftag%3Dnypost-20%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2Fshopping%2Fwhat-is-trt%2F%26asc_source%3Dweb" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Ageless Revolution&lt;/a&gt;” and an anti-aging internist and regenerative physician specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Azis believes that the decline in level is tied to several environmental problems, dietary changes, and how men socialize. “This has to do with increased consumption of ultra-processed food, use of pesticides, excess alcohol, legalization of recreational drugs, smoking, and trans fats,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the ideal testosterone levels?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most medical centers and experts considered normal testosterone levels to land anywhere between 300 to 1,000 nanograms per deciliter. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, age is also an important factor. Azis explained that it is important to look at each patient individually in order to determine whether their levels are considered normal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If testosterone levels are checked, the lab reference is wrong, as it groups all men. Lab levels are 300-1000 nanograms per deciliter, so men in their twenties who are supposed to have a testosterone of 1,000 are placed in the same category as 80-year-old men with levels of 300,” he stated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, Azis explained that some young people with low levels are told that their results are normal when, in reality, they could be ideal candidates for TRT. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Many men suffer as doctors treat those men with drugs for depression or ED pills, versus looking at testosterone levels,” Azis warned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is TRT, and how is TRT used to treat low testosterone?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mostafa Abu-Hijlih, a nurse practitioner practicing at Grand Central Men’s Health in NYC, says that TRT has been a game-changer for his patients. He always felt there was a gap in clinical spaces for men to discuss issues that have been historically stigmatized, but TRT opened up the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Testosterone Replacement Therapy is a medical treatment used to optimize testosterone levels in men and women when indicated, ” Abu-Hijlih explained. “Testosterone is responsible for energy levels, libido, muscle mass, and bone density, and has been shown to improve REM sleep time when optimized.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TRT works by replenishing the lost testosterone that the body is not producing naturally. It’s not about taking extra testosterone but rather restoring the body to a healthy, normal level. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Abu-Hijlih pointed out that the dosage depends on what is needed for each patient, and testosterone levels should be continuously monitored to determine the appropriate dose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is TRT administered?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Abu-Hijlih, there are a few different options for TRT patients when it comes to how testosterone is administered and absorbed.&lt;/p&gt;

class="wp-element-caption"&gt; &lt;span class="credit"&gt;blackday – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TRT is administered through a variety of modalities, including weekly intramuscular injections, topical cream, implantable pellets, or even intranasal nose spray,” he noted. “Really depends on a combination of clinical results, patient preference, and tolerability.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not uncommon for patients to try different administration techniques until they find the one that works best for them. About 90% of Abu-Hijlih’s patients undergo TRT via a weekly intramuscular injection into their arm or their glutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the benefits of TRT&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The benefits of TRT include increased energy, improved sleep quality, higher libido, enhanced intimate performance, and better results at the gym. Abu-Hijlih described how many patients begin to feel young again, with more motivation to participate in all the activities they used to love, but no longer had the energy for.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The improvement in overall quality of life is always incredibly gratifying to witness,” he shared. “They walk in standing taller, [with] higher levels of confidence, regained energy levels to work out at the gym again, and have a bounce in their step that makes it a very gratifying experience for both the patients and the provider.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research has also revealed that TRT is an effective option for addressing psychological and sexual symptoms associated with hypogonadism. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6765788/#:~:text=Men%20most%20frequently%20claimed%20testosterone,emphasis%20on%20sex%20and%20energy." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt; on prescription testosterone found that 52% of men claimed testosterone improved their energy, 42% saw improvements in their libido, and 29% reported muscle growth. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who can benefit from TRT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Deep Patel is not a physician, but he has built his career around solving real-world problems that men deal with every day. His telehealth company, &lt;a data-nyp-link-source="trackonomics" data-nyp-affiliate="true" href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/nypost_01638_nypost?p=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2Fshopping%2Fwhat-is-trt%2F&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fshareasale.com%2Fr.cfm%3Fb%3D999%26u%3D3001441%26m%3D162919%26afftrack%3Dnyp-FF-TXL-whatistrt%26urllink%3Dulo.co%2Fproducts%2Ftestosterone-replacement-therapy&amp;amp;author=Miska%20Salemann&amp;amp;articleID=35941372&amp;amp;event_type=click&amp;amp;publishdate=june%209%2C%202025&amp;amp;linksource=web&amp;amp;primarytag=testosterone&amp;amp;contentsection=shopping" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Ulo&lt;/a&gt;, has been working to make TRT more accessible to men than ever before, and he says that their services are not bound to men over 50.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Younger men can benefit from TRT, too. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“More and more men in their twenties, thirties, and forties are dealing with low T,” Patel shared. “About 40% of men over 45 have clinically &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532933/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;low testosterone&lt;/a&gt;, but we’re seeing younger guys affected too. If that sounds like you, it’s worth getting your levels checked.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to get TRT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many providers and telehealth sites offer TRT services. In many cases, the first step is taking a TRT test and speaking with a doctor about symptoms. Companies like Ulo treat patients holistically, considering their specific needs and tailoring the treatment to their individual symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The biggest mistake people make is doing TRT without medical guidance or buying unregulated testosterone products online,” Patel said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“At Ulo, we monitor every guy’s complete bloodwork regularly, not just testosterone, but also things like hematocrit, estradiol, and lipid profiles — and adjust treatment accordingly to catch issues before they become problems.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Patel explained that the best way to minimize risk is to work with a legitimate provider who actually looks at your bloodwork and adjusts your protocol based on how your body specifically responds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long does it take to see results from TRT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Patel explained that symptom relief can look different in everyone, but you shouldn’t have to wait long to see the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As for results, most guys feel a difference within four to six weeks,” he noted. “More energy, better mood, stronger libido. The body composition changes, like more muscle and less fat, usually take a bit longer, around two to three months.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Patel cited one TRT patient who knew the treatment was working when he woke up one morning and actually wanted to go to the gym for the first time in years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is TRT safe? What are TRT risks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When properly monitored, research indicates that TRT can be safe long-term for most men. That said, every patient needs regular blood work to ensure their levels stay within a healthy range, according to Patel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“TRT does come with risks that need to be taken seriously. The most common side effects include acne, water retention, or elevated red blood cell counts, which can thicken your blood,” he shared. “Some men experience testicular shrinkage or reduced fertility. There are also concerns about cardiovascular risks in certain populations, particularly men with existing heart conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can TRT affect fertility?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes, TRT can affect fertility, especially if you’re not using anything to counteract it. TRT significantly suppresses natural testosterone production, which can also reduce &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6305868/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sperm production&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“But if fertility matters to you, there are medications like HCG or enclomiphene that can be taken&lt;br&gt;alongside TRT to preserve it,” Patel pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10890669/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt;, over 90% of men maintained normal sperm counts when using these fertility-preserving medications with TRT. Patel stressed the importance of telling providers that fertility is a priority before they begin treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much does TRT cost? Does insurance cover TRT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cost of TRT varies depending on factors such as your insurance coverage, provider, treatment needs, and the location of the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some insurance providers do cover TRT, but patients must meet specific thresholds. Most providers require TRT candidates to have medical documentation that indicates their testosterone has fallen below the normal levels, as well as recorded symptoms like fatigue or low libido.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re paying out of pocket, the cost of TRT will depend on the type of treatment. Most testosterone injections cost between $50 and $150, oral tablets around $300, and patches can reach $400. Some telehealth companies offer a range of treatments for a monthly subscription cost, which can range from $100 to $300 per month.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should you try TRT? Is it worth it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Patel has seen many men suffer from low testosterone firsthand. It’s not uncommon for him to hear them say things like “I can’t focus like I used to,” “I feel flat mentally, physically, sexually,” “I’ve lost my drive,” or “I just don’t feel like me anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even after optimizing for sleep, diet, and everything else, their low testosterone was still impacting their everyday lives. Once they received treatment, things began to shift.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They’re not looking for shortcuts. They’re looking to feel normal again,” Patel said. “And, often they’ve tried everything else — better sleep, different diets, supplements, lifestyle changes. TRT is rarely the first thing they try, but for many with genuinely low levels, it’s the solution that finally works.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TRT could be right for you, but, as with any new health treatment, it’s important to consult your physician and explain your symptoms prior to making any changes to your regimen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;ENFLONSIA is a preventive monoclonal antibody designed to protect infants against a spectrum of RSV disease severity, including worsening disease requiring hospitalization&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class="bwalignc"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;ENFLONSIA is the first and only RSV preventive option administered to infants using the same dose regardless of weight&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bw-dateline-wrapper"&gt;RAHWAY, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- &lt;/span&gt;
Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ENFLONSIA™ (clesrovimab-cfor) for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease in neonates (newborns) and infants who are born during or entering their first RSV season. ENFLONSIA is a preventive, long-acting monoclonal antibody (mAb) designed to provide direct, rapid and durable protection through 5 months, a typical RSV season, with the same 105 mg dose regardless of weight. A typical RSV season usually spans autumn to spring of the next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“RSV disease is the leading cause of infant hospitalization in the U.S. and can lead to serious respiratory conditions like bronchiolitis and pneumonia,” said Dr. Octavio Ramilo, chair of the Department of Infectious Diseases at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and investigator for the CLEVER (MK-1654-004) and SMART (MK-1654-007) trials. “ENFLONSIA combines dosing convenience with strong clinical data showing significant reductions in RSV disease incidence and hospitalizations, making it a promising new intervention to help protect infants from RSV.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ENFLONSIA should not be administered to infants with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to any component of ENFLONSIA. See additional Selected Safety Information below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approval is based on results from the pivotal Phase 2b/3 CLEVER trial (MK-1654-004) evaluating a single dose of ENFLONSIA administered to preterm and full-term infants (birth to 1 year of age). The trial met its primary and key secondary endpoints, as outlined below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="bwlistdisc"&gt;&lt;li&gt;ENFLONSIA demonstrated a reduction in incidence of RSV-associated medically attended lower respiratory infections (MALRI) requiring ≥1 indicator of lower respiratory infection (LRI) or severity compared to placebo through 5 months (primary endpoint) by 60.5% (95% CI: 44.2, 72.0, p&amp;lt;0.001) (incidence rates: ENFLONSIA, 0.026; placebo, 0.065).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ENFLONSIA demonstrated a reduction in RSV-associated hospitalizations through 5 months (key secondary endpoint) by 84.3% (95% CI: 66.7, 92.6, p&amp;lt;0.001) (incidence rates: ENFLONSIA, 0.004; placebo, 0.024), showing increasing efficacy with increasing disease severity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approval is also supported by results from the Phase 3 SMART trial (MK-1654-007) evaluating the safety and efficacy of ENFLONSIA versus palivizumab in infants at increased risk for severe RSV disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ENFLONSIA provides an important new preventive option to help protect healthy and at-risk infants born during or entering their first RSV season with the same dose regardless of weight,” said Dr. Dean Y. Li, president, Merck Research Laboratories. “We are committed to ensuring availability of ENFLONSIA in the U.S. before the start of the upcoming RSV season to help reduce the significant burden of this widespread seasonal infection on families and health care systems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is expected to meet later this month to discuss and make recommendations for the use of ENFLONSIA in infants. Ordering is anticipated to begin in July, with shipments delivered before the start of the 2025-2026 RSV season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About ENFLONSIA™ (clesrovimab-cfor)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ENFLONSIA (clesrovimab-cfor) is Merck’s extended half-life monoclonal antibody (mAb) indicated for passive immunization for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease in newborns and infants who are born during or entering their first RSV season. ENFLONSIA is administered using non-weight-based dosing and is designed to provide direct, rapid and durable protection through 5 months, a typical RSV season. For infants born during the RSV season, ENFLONSIA is to be administered starting from birth. For infants born outside of the RSV season, ENFLONSIA should be administered prior to the start of their first RSV season. For infants undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass during or entering their first RSV season, an additional 105 mg dose is recommended as soon as the infant is stable after surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Selected Safety Information for ENFLONSIA&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;(clesrovimab-cfor)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not administer ENFLONSIA to infants with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to any component of ENFLONSIA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been observed with other human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibodies. If signs or symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common adverse reactions were injection-site erythema (3.8%), injection-site swelling (2.7%) and rash (2.3%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Clinical Trials and Data Supporting U.S. FDA Approval&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CLEVER trial (MK-1654-004) (&lt;a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclassic.clinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04767373&amp;amp;esheet=54271340&amp;amp;newsitemid=20250609303937&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=NCT04767373&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;md5=bce1f4aa575013b9fa9bac315951e307" rel="nofollow"&gt;NCT04767373&lt;/a&gt;) was a Phase 2b/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ENFLONSIA in early and moderate preterm infants (≥29 to &amp;lt;35 weeks gestational age [GA]) and late preterm and full-term infants (≥35 weeks GA) entering their first RSV season. Participants were randomized 2:1 to receive a single 105 mg dose of ENFLONSIA (N=2,411) or saline placebo (N=1,203) by intramuscular (IM) injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary endpoint was the incidence of participants with RSV-associated medically attended lower respiratory infection (MALRI) characterized as cough or difficulty breathing and requiring ≥1 indicator of LRI (wheezing, rales/crackles) or severity (chest wall in-drawing/retractions, hypoxemia, tachypnea, dehydration due to respiratory symptoms) from Day 1 through Day 150 (5 months) after dosing. Medically attended includes all health care provider visits in settings such as outpatient clinic, clinical study site, emergency department, urgent care center and/or hospital. The key secondary endpoint was RSV-associated hospitalization through Day 150 (5 months).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial demonstrated that the safety profile of ENFLONSIA in infants entering their first RSV season was generally comparable to placebo. The most common adverse reactions were injection-site erythema occurring within 5 days post-dose (ENFLONSIA: 3.8%; placebo: 3.3%), injection-site swelling occurring within 5 days post-dose (ENFLONSIA: 2.7%; placebo: 2.6%) and rash occurring within 14 days post-dose (ENFLONSIA: 2.3%; placebo: 1.9%). Participants were monitored for serious adverse events (SAEs) through the duration of their participation for up to 365 days post-dose. Most (≥97%) of the adverse reactions were toxicity grade 1 (mild) or grade 2 (moderate).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SMART trial (MK-1654-007) (&lt;a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT04938830%3Fintr%3DClesrovimab%26rank%3D3&amp;amp;esheet=54271340&amp;amp;newsitemid=20250609303937&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=NCT04938830&amp;amp;index=2&amp;amp;md5=e35858ee892e471e42dc431ade70ecef" rel="nofollow"&gt;NCT04938830&lt;/a&gt;) was a Phase 3, randomized, partially-blind, palivizumab-controlled, multi-site trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ENFLONSIA in infants at increased risk of severe RSV disease, including early (&amp;lt;29 weeks GA) or moderate preterm infants (≥29 to ≤35 weeks GA) and infants with chronic lung disease of prematurity or congenital heart disease of any GA. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive ENFLONSIA (N=446) or palivizumab (N=450) by IM injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among infants at increased risk of severe RSV disease and entering their first RSV season, the trial demonstrated that the safety profile of ENFLONSIA was generally comparable to palivizumab and consistent with the safety profile of ENFLONSIA in infants in the CLEVER trial. The efficacy of ENFLONSIA in infants at increased risk for severe RSV disease was established by extrapolation of efficacy of ENFLONSIA from the CLEVER trial to the SMART trial based on similar pharmacokinetic exposure. The incidence rates of RSV-associated MALRI requiring ≥1 indicator of LRI or severity and RSV-associated hospitalization were generally comparable between ENFLONSIA (3.6%, 95% CI: 2.0, 6.0 and 1.3%, 95% CI: 0.4, 2.9, respectively) and palivizumab (2.9%, 95% CI: 1.5, 5.2 and 1.5%, 95% CI: 0.5, 3.2, respectively) through Day 150 (5 months).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In clinical trials, when ENFLONSIA was given concomitantly with routine childhood vaccines, the safety profile of the co-administered regimen was generally comparable to the safety profile when ENFLONSIA and childhood vaccines were administered alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Merck&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, we are unified around our purpose: We use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world.

			&lt;p&gt;We know that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-most-effective-way-to-floss-your-teeth-requires-just-three-easy-steps"&gt;flossing is generally good&lt;/a&gt; for our oral health, but researchers from Tufts University in the United States have gone one step further, developing smart floss that monitors your stress levels as well as keeping your teeth and gums clean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It works through the use of a narrow channel in the floss, which draws in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"&gt;saliva&lt;/a&gt;. The saliva is then passed over electrodes attached to the floss, before being analyzed by a built-in sensor, with readings transmitted to a phone app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We didn't want measurement to create an additional source of stress, so we thought, can we make a sensing device that becomes part of your day-to-day routine?" &lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2025/05/23/dental-floss-can-measure-stress"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; electrical and computer engineer Sameer Sonkusale, from Tufts University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cortisol is a stress marker found in saliva, so flossing seemed like a natural fit to take a daily sample."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The smart floss addresses one of the main problems with tracking stress: it's not all that easy to measure properly, with self-reporting and psychological tests susceptible to bias, and current cortisol analysis &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hsr.2023.100079"&gt;relying on blood samples&lt;/a&gt; and lab work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A smart floss approach would be quicker, more convenient, and easier to fit into a daily routine. There's plenty of work still to do – this prototype was tested using a lab setup, not by people actually flossing – but there's definitely potential here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_162972" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-162972" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/FlossPrototype.jpg" alt="Smart floss prototype" class="wp-image-162972 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/FlossPrototype.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/FlossPrototype-634x415.jpg 634w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/FlossPrototype-600x393.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-162972" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The prototype device developed by researchers. (Atul Sharma/Nafize Ishtiaque Hossain)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key to the invention is a material called eMIP (or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coelec.2020.09.007"&gt;electropolymerized molecularly imprinted polymer&lt;/a&gt;) that enables the device to recognize cortisol. It's a bit like a microscopic plaster cast, made to fit a specific shape – in this case, the shape of cortisol molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eMIP massively cuts down on the work and expense normally required to develop a biosensor like this. What's more, it was shown to be very accurate in tests – the researchers found it was as good as any other current sensor at detecting cortisol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"eMIP does not rely on a lot of investment in making  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="162969" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt; or receptors," &lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2025/05/23/dental-floss-can-measure-stress"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sonkusale. "If you discover a new marker for stress or any other disease or condition, you can just create a polymer cast in a very short period of time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This means the system can be easily adapted to detect other biological markers too, like tracking hormone levels for fertility or glucose levels to monitor diabetes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_162974" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-162974" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/FlossIllustration.jpg" alt="Smart floss illustration" class="wp-image-162974 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/FlossIllustration.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/FlossIllustration-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/FlossIllustration-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-162974" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cortisol readings could be transmitted to a smartphone app. (Nafize Ishtiaque Hossain)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most of us will come under stresses and strains of some type or other during the day, chronic, long-term stress is a significant health issue. It can often increase the risk of other serious conditions, including cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure. It's also linked to mental health problems, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mindfulness-can-rival-antidepressants-for-anxiety-study-finds"&gt;including anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="162969" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers do note some limitations in their device, aside from it being early in its development. They see the smart floss as being of most use in monitoring a health condition rather than diagnosing it in the first place – not least because saliva biomarkers can vary between individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For diagnostics, blood is still the gold standard," &lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2025/05/23/dental-floss-can-measure-stress"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sonkusale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once you are diagnosed and put on medication, if you need to track, say, a cardiovascular condition over time to see if your heart health is improving, then monitoring with the sensor can be easy and allows for timely interventions when needed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5c02988"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ACS Applied Materials &amp;amp; Interfaces&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
