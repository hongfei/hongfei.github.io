Researchers observed that healthy spouses of partners with insomnia, depression, and anxiety developed similar mental health symptoms and microbiota profiles within six months of marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found strong correlations between shared bacterial strains, altered cortisol levels, and increased depression and anxiety scores. While the findings are not yet causal, they highlight a possible microbial route for emotional contagion between intimate partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microbial Convergence:&lt;/strong&gt; Spouses’ oral microbiomes became more similar over time, particularly when one partner had depression and anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mood Correlation:&lt;/strong&gt; Changes in microbiota composition correlated with increased salivary cortisol and worsening mental health in the healthy partner.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Bacteria Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher levels of Clostridia, Veillonella, Bacillus, and Lachnospiraceae were linked to the depression-anxiety phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Xia &amp;amp; He Publishing Inc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oral microbiota dysbiosis and altered salivary cortisol levels have been linked to depression and anxiety. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that bacterial transmission can occur between spouses, this study aimed to investigate whether the transmission of oral microbiota between newlywed couples mediates symptoms of depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Validated Persian versions of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and Beck Anxiety Inventory were administered to 1,740 couples who had been married for six months. The researchers compared 268 healthy control spouses with 268 affected cases in a cross-sectional study. Data were analyzed using appropriate statistical methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After six months, healthy spouses married to an insomniac with the depression-anxiety (DA) phenotype scored significantly higher on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and Beck Anxiety Inventory compared to their baseline scores. This indicates that their sleep quality, depression, and anxiety scores became more similar to those of their affected spouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the composition of their oral microbiota changed significantly, becoming increasingly similar to that of their spouses. Specifically, in couples where one partner had the DA phenotype, the oral microbiota of the healthy spouse mirrored that of the affected partner (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These microbial changes correlated with alterations in salivary cortisol levels as well as depression and anxiety scores. Linear discriminant analysis revealed that the relative abundances of &lt;em&gt;Clostridia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Veillonella&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bacillus&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Lachnospiraceae&lt;/em&gt; were significantly higher in insomniacs with the DA phenotype compared to healthy controls (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transmission of oral microbiota plays a partial role in mediating depression and anxiety among couples. Since this study is associational, further research is needed to establish whether this association is causal. If it is determined that this association is indeed causal, it could have significant implications for contemporary research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We propose that, within the framework of diagnostic, predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine, the practical and theoretical implications of this study may enhance our understanding of various aspects of microbiota-host interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this microbiome and mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#097a6c7b7f606a6c49716068616c797c6b65607a6160676e276a6664" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Shelly Zhang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://xiahepublishing.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Xia &amp;amp; He Publishing Inc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Shelly Zhang – Xia &amp;amp; He Publishing Inc&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.14218/ERHM.2025.00013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Oral Microbiota Transmission Partially Mediates Depression and Anxiety in Newlywed Couples&lt;/a&gt;” by Neil Daghnall et al. &lt;em&gt;Exploratory Research and Hypothesis in Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p id="p21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 14:59:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9XaThDUEtuZGVHVlQ4M2JyWG1Ba0dFRk41bnlhN3lpbVVEZjVldWFHZFlXNWM4RG0yM2dvbUtWQnFKdWVfOHJiRC0tTFVJTklRRHVDbHpKR2VZZGNrV19MLUlQME1fU0Jwd0N6bHpPeFRVUnVkd1VNVk4xQQ</guid></item><item><title>这是您不想忘记清洗的身体部位： “总是捕捉污垢” -《纽约邮报》 | This is the one body part you don’t want to forget to wash: ‘Always traps grime’ - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxPSllFZTJiRC1aVmRrVjl1NzM1eWxkQVFhQ3dyblg5ZlZ3SUFMSlRLQXBuWmwxQUJPQ1hISmoxYnY4d3hyRU9ybFU2YmV4LUZjZWJoRVBYVDhaSGY0U2dRampKdkM3OHIwS3g4VEZ6ZHJEUUdESXE1bThJQ2dPVmVnMy05NjlBZ3AybUp3NnQyUXlhOUZBNEo1YXFQMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;You might be rinsing and repeating — but you’re probably not as clean as you think.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dermatologists say there’s one spot most people overlook in their shower routine where dirt, oil and dead skin cells can accumulate quickly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Left unchecked, that buildup can lead to bacterial infections, painful skin problems and a foul odor that lingers long after you’ve toweled off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Studies show roughly two-thirds of Americans shower daily.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Daria – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/how-to-clean-your-ear"&gt;generally agree&lt;/a&gt; that your ears do a good job of cleaning themselves, so you can probably toss the Q-tips. But the area around them is a different story. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I always recommend people wash the skin behind their ears intentionally and specifically to get into the creases of where the ear meets your skin, as it can always trap grime,” &lt;a href="https://www.beloithealthsystem.org/find-a-provider/roger-kapoor-m-d-m-b-a-f-a-a-d-/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Roger Kapoor&lt;/a&gt;, a dermatologist and senior vice president at Beloit Memorial Hospital, &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/most-people-forget-to-wash-this-body-part" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told Parade&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;That’s especially true in summer, when sweat and sunscreen create a moist breeding ground for bacteria and fungus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For people who wear glasses, the arms resting behind the ears can also easily transfer bacteria to the skin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Ear-itation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Oil, dirt, and dead skin cells piling up behind your ears can clog pores and cause painful pimples and acne.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It can also irritate your skin — and even trigger &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/eczema/what-to-know-about-ear-eczema" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ear eczema&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ear eczema symptoms range from hardly noticeable to extremely uncomfortable.

 &lt;span class="credit"&gt;artem_goncharov – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This inflammatory skin condition causes red, itchy patches that can be dry, flaky or waxy, depending on the type.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Any inflammatory condition of the skin can lead to cracks in the natural skin barrier, allowing bacteria in and causing infections,” Dr. &lt;a href="https://stcharlesdermatologicsurgery.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Stacey Tull&lt;/a&gt;, a dermatologist and micrographic dermatologic surgeon, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-to-wash-dirtiest-body-parts-in-shower-study-8384889"&gt;told Real Simple&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even tiny cuts, piercings or scratches inside the ear can open the door to infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In rare but serious cases, those infections can spread beyond the ear and into the bloodstream — potentially leading to life-threatening sepsis, when the body starts attacking its own organs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What’s that smell?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Infections behind the ears can also give off a foul, cheeselike stench, often thanks to bacteria, yeast and fungi, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/smell-behind-ears#causes"&gt;according to Healthline&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Possible causes of a smell behind the ear include poor hygiene and infections.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Krakenimages.com – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sweat gland behind the ears also secrete perspiration starts to stink once it mixes with bacteria and oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add sebaceous glands, which secrete a waxy mix of oils and fats, and you’ve got a recipe for some serious funk if it builds up. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem can be even worse for people with overactive glands that release extra sweat and oil.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Wash up — and when to get help&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If an infection is painful, you have a fever, swollen lymph nodes or home treatments like over-the-counter antifungal creams don’t work, it’s probably time to see a doctor, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325081#prevention" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt; reports. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some infections need stronger antibiotics to clear up and prevent serious complications. Doctors can also prescribe anti-inflammatory ointments to soothe eczema symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Doctors can help diagnose pain behind the ear and recommend various treatments.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;bnenin – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, the area behind your ears is simple to clean. All you need is gentle soap and warm water.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trickiest part is probably remembering to scrub the area after hitting all the usual spots in the shower.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kapoor says shampoo can help break down oil and bacteria behind your ears, but it rinses off quickly unless you specifically scrub the area.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you wear glasses, he also recommends cleaning the arms regularly to keep bacteria from transferring to your skin.&lt;/p&gt;

However, its effects typically last only a week, and frequent dosing poses risks like dissociation or addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study demonstrates that ketamine’s benefits can be extended up to two months by using a compound that enhances ERK signaling, a pathway essential to ketamine’s long-term action. This breakthrough offers a proof of principle for safer, more sustained depression treatment strategies targeting intracellular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid-Acting Relief:&lt;/strong&gt; Ketamine alleviates depression symptoms within hours, even in resistant patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extended Efficacy:&lt;/strong&gt; A compound called BCI prolonged ketamine’s antidepressant effect up to two months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanism-Based Strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; Enhancing ERK signaling may help sustain antidepressant effects from a single dose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Vanderbilt University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roughly 10 percent of the U.S. population is afflicted with major depressive disorder at any given time, and up to 20 percent will exhibit MDD symptoms over their lifetimes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet despite its prevalence, methods to treat MDD often fall short for a not-insignificant portion of the population. Antidepressants—the standard of treatment—don’t work for 30 percent with MDD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When infused at a low dose ketamine shows remarkable efficacy as a rapidly acting antidepressant, with effects observed within hours even in patients who have been resistant to other antidepressant treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110354"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;By inhibiting the phosphatase, the authors retained ERK’s activity and augmented the synaptic plasticity that drives ketamine’s prolonged antidepressant effects.

Limbird Chair in Pharmacology and is the Barlow Family Director of the Vanderbilt Brain Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, researchers in the field had determined that ketamine’s antidepressant effect requires the activation of a key signaling pathway called ERK, but only ketamine’s long-term effects—not its rapid effects—are abolished when ERK is inhibited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a fast-acting antidepressant, ketamine relies on ERK-dependent synaptic plasticity to produce its rapid behavioral effects. Ma and colleagues hypothesized that they could maintain ketamine’s effects for longer periods by enhancing ERK activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the recent paper, Ma discovered that ketamine’s antidepressant effects could be sustained for up to two months by using a drug called BCI, which inhibits a protein phosphatase and results in increased ERK activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By inhibiting the phosphatase, the authors retained ERK’s activity and augmented the synaptic plasticity that drives ketamine’s prolonged antidepressant effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the use of BCI make the application of these results to the clinic difficult, Monteggia said that the results provide a proof of principle that ketamine’s antidepressant action can be sustained by targeting intracellular signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and Kavalali, the William Stokes Professor of Experimental Therapeutics and the chair of the Department of Pharmacology, have worked on the project since its inception and hope that it fosters other studies looking to identify specific molecules that will enhance and sustain the action of a single dose of ketamine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this work will be a steppingstone toward improving MDD patients’ lives by reducing the burden of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopharmacology and depression research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#afc2ceddc6dcdcce81dcc7cedfc6ddc0efd9cec1cbcaddcdc6c3db81cacbda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Marissa Shapiro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://vanderbilt.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Vanderbilt University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Marissa Shapiro – Vanderbilt University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.abb6748" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Enhanced ERK activity extends ketamine’s antidepressant effects by augmenting synaptic plasticity&lt;/a&gt;” by Lisa Monteggia et al. &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced ERK activity extends ketamine’s antidepressant effects by augmenting synaptic plasticity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeated ketamine treatment to maintain a rapid antidepressant effect can lead to side effects over time, highlighting an unmet clinical need for sustaining this drug’s antidepressant action from a single administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ketamine-induced synaptic potentiation at CA3-CA1 synapses has been proposed to be a key synaptic substrate for antidepressant action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we found that ketamine-induced CA3-CA1 synaptic potentiation could be augmented by transiently increasing extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) activity through pharmacological inhibition of dual-specificity phosphatases 6 (DUSP6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antidepressant-like behavioral effects of acute ketamine treatment were extended by DUSP6 inhibition for up to 2 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The selective deletion of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) in excitatory neurons abolished these DUSP6 inhibition–mediated synaptic and behavioral effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These data suggest that ketamine’s rapid antidepressant effects can be sustained by selectively targeting downstream intracellular signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s that effective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Wells added that “what we’ve learned here is that there’s a lot of communities across the US that have these lower vaccination rates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Summer tends to be a high season for travel, and travelers may import measles from a state or country experiencing an outbreak into at-risk communities like these, Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;If we had vaccine coverage above 95%, we would not see these outbreaks.

It’s so important for us to have local public health departments that can respond to things like measles or whatever the next outbreak is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE4yTEN3Nm1VQ1JWMDdpNFV2WXFHdDVDZlpGemhIQ3lvRmxyQWhrWDhCdVBpdzkyMGZGbmR5M2NKdTJNd3l3RmpKQjBkNUtqQS1vNGZzMUk4TXFsMjF2aUJMcnJUcGVxVnJsSmRTeU5YdVZwT0dxM28yOTF3</guid></item><item><title>根据胃肠病学家的说法，最简单的高纤维交换可以改善肠道健康- EatingWell | The Easiest High-Fiber Swap for Better Gut Health, According to a Gastroenterologist - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE01QWN1Y0c4XzdLeTZrV0dDb05BQU9IZHRGb3h4b3FNeE8zWTFjTG9scjVNdloyTl8teHNZUzJMT2VnSlFEYkZHdEpyNEY0LThxbWtLWERkZnVpNFFtQzBzcEJHSmg5a3h4cThGZVFKaE9oMlhQQ0JhTHZQRHlTaE0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A gastroenterologist suggests swapping white bread for sprouted grain or whole wheat bread.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;White bread is made with refined grains, which can cause blood sugar spikes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sprouted grain and whole wheat bread are gut-healthy options that can support heart health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At &lt;em&gt;EatingWell&lt;/em&gt;, we believe that any food can be enjoyed in a healthy eating pattern. Sometimes this means having less nutritious foods in moderation rather than completely cutting them out of your diet. And it could also mean swapping some of your go-tos with similar, healthier versions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In a recent Instagram video, gastroenterologist &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/fact-or-fiction-gastroenterologist-on-gut-health-myths-8726665" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Will Bulsiewicz, M.D., MSCI&lt;/a&gt;, shared an easy swap that you can make for your breakfast or lunch. If you’re a toast lover or sandwich fan, this is for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It’s time to rethink your bread, because there’s a high probability that your pantry has white bread, which is made from refined grains,” Bulsiewicz says. He then explains why eating refined grains isn’t the best option for your gut health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “When they refine the grains, they’re stripping away the fiber, the vitamins, the minerals, all the good stuff,” he shares. “Throwing that in the trash, and they’re leaving you with the stuff that’s going to spike your blood sugar.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There is recent science that shows a diet high in ultra-processed foods and refined carbs can increase your risk for gut and heart problems.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; On the flip side, research suggests that focusing on whole grains can help reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s why Bulsiewicz recommends swapping out white bread for sprouted grain or whole-wheat bread.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “This type of whole grain bread means more fiber, slower digestion, better blood sugar control plus the whole grains have antioxidants and phytonutrients that are wonderful for you and have anti-inflammatory properties,” Bulsiewicz explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Brands like Food for Life and Dave’s Killer Bread sell delicious sprouted grain bread in the same aisle as your other favorite loaves.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s important to note that if you’re a fan of white bread, it’s totally OK to have it when you’re in the mood for it. But if you’re a daily bread eater, swapping for a more nutrient-rich option is a smart choice. Choose whole-wheat or sprouted grain when making a high-protein &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8046558/best-tuna-salad-recipe/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;tuna salad sandwich&lt;/a&gt;, or when you’re enjoying toast with jam or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-peanut-butter-good-for-you-8638482" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;peanut butter&lt;/a&gt;.

Researchers aim to adapt the system for other saliva-based health markers, potentially transforming personal health monitoring across conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress Detection:&lt;/strong&gt; The floss-based sensor measures cortisol from saliva using advanced polymer molds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-Marker Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Can be adapted to detect other biomarkers, like glucose or estrogen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home Use:&lt;/strong&gt; Designed for untrained individuals, making daily stress tracking simple and noninvasive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Tufts University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chronic stress can lead to increased blood pressure and cardiovascular disease, decreased immune function, depression, and anxiety. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the tools we use to monitor stress are often imprecise or expensive, relying on self-reporting questionnaires and psychiatric evaluations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110350"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a person with a swab in their mouth." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/cortisol-self-test-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The saliva is picked up by capillary action through a very narrow channel in the floss. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now a Tufts interdisciplinary engineer and his team have devised a simple device using specially designed floss that can easily and accurately measure cortisol, a stress hormone, in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It started in a collaboration with several departments across Tufts, examining how stress and other cognitive states affect problem solving and learning,” said Sameer Sonkusale, professor of electrical and computer engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t want measurement to create an additional source of stress, so we thought, can we make a sensing device that becomes part of your day-to-day routine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cortisol is a stress marker found in saliva, so flossing seemed like a natural fit to take a daily sample.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their design of a saliva-sensing dental floss looks just like a common floss pick, with the string stretched across two prongs extending from a flat plastic handle, all about the size of your index finger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The saliva is picked up by capillary action through a very narrow channel in the floss. The fluid is drawn into the pick handle and an attached tab, where it spreads across electrodes that detect the cortisol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortisol recognition on the electrodes is accomplished with a remarkable technology developed almost 30 years ago called electropolymerized molecularly imprinted polymers (eMIPs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They work similarly to the way you might make a plaster cast of your hand. A polymer is formed around a template molecule, in this case cortisol, which is later removed to leave behind binding sites. These sites have a physical and chemical shape “memory” of the target molecule so they can bind free-floating molecules that are coming in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eMIP molds are versatile, so one can create dental floss sensors that detect other molecules that can be found in saliva, such as estrogen for fertility tracking, glucose for diabetes monitoring, or markers for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also potential for detecting multiple biomarkers in saliva at the same time, for more accurate monitoring of stress, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The eMIP approach is a game changer,” said Sonkusale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Biosensors have typically been developed using antibodies or other receptors that pick up the molecule of interest. Once a marker is found, a lot of work has to go into bioengineering the receiving molecule attached to the sensor. eMIP does not rely on a lot of investment in making antibodies or receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you discover a new marker for stress or any other disease or condition, you can just create a polymer cast in a very short period of time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accuracy of the cortisol sensors is comparable to the best-performing sensors on the market or in development. Bringing this device into the home and in the hands of individuals without need for training will make it possible to fold stress monitoring into many aspects of health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently Sonkusale and his colleagues are creating a startup to try and bring the product to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He points out that while the dental floss sensor is quantitatively highly accurate, the practice of tracking markers in saliva is best for monitoring, not for the initial diagnosis of a condition. That’s in part because saliva markers can still have variations between individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For diagnostics, blood is still the gold standard, but once you are diagnosed and put on medication, if you need to track, say, a cardiovascular condition over time to see if your heart health is improving, then monitoring with the sensor can be easy and allows for timely interventions when needed,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces&lt;/em&gt;, adds to a number of  thread-based sensor innovations by Sonkusale and his research team including sensors that can detect gases, metabolites in sweat, or movement when embedded in clothing and transistors that can be woven into flexible electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this mental health and neurotech research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#234e4a48460d504a4f5546516357564557500d464756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mike Silver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://tufts.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tufts University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Mike Silver – Tufts University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5c02988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Saliva-Sensing Dental Floss: An Innovative Tool for Assessing Stress via On-Demand Salivary Cortisol Measurement with Molecularly Imprinted Polymer and Thread Microfluidics Integration&lt;/a&gt;” by Sameer Sonkusale et al. &lt;em&gt;ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saliva-Sensing Dental Floss: An Innovative Tool for Assessing Stress via On-Demand Salivary Cortisol Measurement with Molecularly Imprinted Polymer and Thread Microfluidics Integration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On-demand dental-floss-based point-of-care platform is developed for the noninvasive and real-time quantification of salivary cortisol utilizing redox-molecule embedded molecularly imprinted polymer structures and thread microfluidics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herein, we explore the high-surface-area graphene-based electrode substrate for electrochemically synthesizing selective cortisol MIPs and integrate it with thread microfluidics to build a highly sensitive cortisol-sensing platform for stress monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This platform uses flossing to collect and transport saliva to a flexible electrochemical sensor via capillary microfluidics, where cortisol, a stress biomarker, is measured. This strategy allowed us to detect cortisol as low as 0.048 pg mL&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; in real-time with a detection range of 0.10–10,000 pg mL&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.9916).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The saliva-sensing dental floss provides results within 11–12 min. The thread-based microfluidic design minimizes interference and ensures consistent repeatability when testing both artificial and actual human saliva samples, yielding 98.64–102.4% recoveries with a relative standard deviation of 5.01%, demonstrating high accuracy and precision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the human saliva sample (as part of the stress study), the platform showed a high correlation (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.9910) against conventional ELISA assays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined with a wireless readout, this saliva floss offers a convenient way to monitor daily stress levels. It can be extended to detect other critical salivary biomarkers with high sensitivity and selectivity in complex environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 12:59:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE0xYURWQ0lTMXpfVTVXNzFtRW1YaGtFanRZS2V3b2xNZUFzZ25vRDJOaVNpbVBWME13WFFlcENYakR2X3VPTGFENHpJUG5NMEg2RmVncEVWa0ZFZGFKMmV6RFA3QW5jUkZudHc</guid></item><item><title>医生揭示了您需要开始服用的关键维生素组合- AOL.com | Doctors Reveal the Crucial Vitamin Combo You Need to Start Taking - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE1wSEt5Y0VwWVNyS0x6OEp0aEVzcTdoYkFxMnpLYVpXSDB4Y21ETVFqQ0thbVBFckRHT0xuX0wwUnd4WXNnUWRORDhfUEl3ckZCbWk3bWlfbGJweWoyNzhrZGlPTVA2TXZNNGtxNEFwSDViSllaTjZTS19sMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;6 Ideal Vitamin Pairs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Tanja Ivanova - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some things just go better together — and that includes certain vitamins and minerals.

is essential for many metabolic processes, from regulating muscle and nerve function to blood sugar levels. Vitamin B6 provides essential support, helping to improve the absorption of magnesium in your intestines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vitamin B6 helps more magnesium enter into your bloodstream,” explains Cole. “What’s more, magnesium plays a role in activating vitamin B6 into its useful form in the body. Whether patients are taking magnesium for muscle health or sleep, I often recommend taking it with a B6 source, so that each nutrient can boost the other’s effectiveness.” As an added perk, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0208454" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that magnesium and vitamin B6 can help relieve stress when taken together. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin C and iron&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iron-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Iron;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Iron&lt;/a&gt; is an important nutrient for healthy blood, and vitamin C plays a significant role in helping your body absorb it. You can call them a power couple: &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11124756/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that &lt;strong&gt;pairing these nutrients in a meal together is more effective than eating them separately.&lt;/strong&gt; This same synergistic effect applies if you’re taking iron supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you consume iron-rich foods or an iron supplement alongside a source of vitamin C — like a glass or orange juice — it helps convert iron into a form that’s easier for your body to absorb,” explains Dr. Church. “This pairing is especially beneficial to vegetarians or anyone looking to naturally improve their iron levels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin A and zinc&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-Consumer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Vitamin A;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Vitamin A&lt;/a&gt; supports your vision, skin health, immune system and more — but it depends on zinc to do its job.&lt;strong&gt; Zinc deficiency &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11756065/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lowers the bioavailability;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lowers the bioavailability&lt;/a&gt; of vitamin A, and because these deficiencies tend to occur at the same time, it’s a smart move to combine these nutrients. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve seen firsthand that vitamin A, whether from foods like carrots or supplements, doesn’t get processed as efficiently when people are low in zinc,” says Dr. Church. “Ensuring you get enough zinc from zinc-rich foods, like beans or shellfish, when you’re also eating vitamin A-rich foods helps these nutrients work together so vitamin A can be effectively absorbed and transported in the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin E and selenium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antioxidants are molecules that protect your cells from damage — and together, they’re even more powerful.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2405457723011968" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Vitamin E and selenium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Vitamin E and selenium&lt;/a&gt; are a prime example of complementary antioxidants that make an excellent team.&lt;/strong&gt; Selenium has the ability to help “recycle” vitamin E in your body, bringing it back to its active form to fight even more free radicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By getting both nutrients — for instance, eating selenium-rich Brazil nuts along with vitamin E-rich almonds or spinach — you enhance the antioxidant impact,” says Dr. Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin D, vitamin K2 and vitamin A&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk about a triple threat: &lt;strong&gt;This fat-soluble vitamin trio works synergistically to support bone health, immune function and proper calcium utilization&lt;/strong&gt;. Together, vitamin D, vitamin K, and vitamin A help ensure that your body functions at its best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vitamin K2 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5613455/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:helps direct calcium to bones;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;helps direct calcium to bones&lt;/a&gt; rather than soft tissues when vitamin D increases calcium absorption, while vitamin A balances the immune-regulating properties of vitamin D,” says Dr. Cole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamins you shouldn't mix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to remember that not all vitamins and minerals get along. Some nutrients actually counteract each other, which means spacing them out is a smarter approach. Some examples of &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a64620677/vitamins-you-shouldnt-mix/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin combinations to avoid;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin combinations to avoid&lt;/a&gt; include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, certain nutrients can supercharge the healthy powers of other nutrients when you take them together. But ultimately, synergy is more than just pairing the right nutrients — timing, balance and individual needs matter, too. Always talk to your healthcare provider before adding potential supplements to your routine to make sure they’re safe and effective for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 12:41:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE1wSEt5Y0VwWVNyS0x6OEp0aEVzcTdoYkFxMnpLYVpXSDB4Y21ETVFqQ0thbVBFckRHT0xuX0wwUnd4WXNnUWRORDhfUEl3ckZCbWk3bWlfbGJweWoyNzhrZGlPTVA2TXZNNGtxNEFwSDViSllaTjZTS19sMA</guid></item><item><title>根据新科学，步行仅需5分钟即可对您的大脑产生影响- AOL.com | Walking For Just 5 Minutes Does This To Your Brain, Per New Science - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE0tdW5MT1hZRVZ0REZrcDJxSHp1eG9KZ253X3RGQVVFY0ZNOC1jTDEzcnNpTVZyVkpuNnpmU1VkOTVlc1RRYmFIMFVkcnJvcU5SOFgzWENQMUY3dUpLS09SSUJyaFVCeGtORlowTlNKSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Walking For Just 5 Minutes Does This To Your Brain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Westend61 - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new study found five minutes of a certain type of exercise can boost your brain health, especially in older adults.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to the elevation in your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g30985585/hiit-workout-at-home/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart rate;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart rate&lt;/a&gt; with "brisk" physical activity, more blood flow goes to your brain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The key is to exercise to the point where you notice heart rate and breathing rate increase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64803574/brain-doctors-neurologists-on-protecting-brain-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Taking care of your brain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Taking care of your brain&lt;/a&gt; requires a 360 approach, and includes simple things like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a42112641/7-day-meal-plan-for-weight-loss/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:eating well;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;eating well&lt;/a&gt;, exercising regularly, and constantly challenging your mind by learning and trying new things. But new research also suggests that logging just five minutes of a particular exercise can help give your brain a big boost, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/54/4/afaf072/8106300?login=false" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Age and Aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Age and Aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, found that doing short bursts of exercise that raise your heart rate can help enhance cognitive performance, especially in older adults. But what kind of exercise are we talking about and why does it help? Here’s the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil,&lt;/a&gt; DO, is a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA; &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev,&lt;/a&gt; MD, is the medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University; &lt;a href="https://www.adventhealth.com/institute/adventhealth-research-institute/team/audrey-collins" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Audrey Collins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Audrey Collins&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, is the lead study author and a post-doctoral research scientist with AdventHealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers analyzed data from 585 older adults between the ages of 65 and 80 who participated in the longitudinal IGNITE trial. The researchers looked at a range of things, including the participants’ &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64853713/sleep-cognitive-performance-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sleep habits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sleep habits&lt;/a&gt;, physical activity, and sedentary behavior over 24 hours, and stacked that against their cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a macro level, the researchers found that people who did more exercise had better brain health. When they did less, it seemed to decline. But when they dug into the specifics, they found that doing just five minutes of exercise that gets your heart rate up—like a brisk walk, water aerobics, or a light jog—was linked with better cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, when people did more moderate-to-vigorous physical activity like brisk walking, they had better processing speed, (how fast your brain thinks), executive function (how well you plan, focus, and multitask) and working memory (your ability to store information for short periods of time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is brisk walking good for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big perk of brisk walking is that it can get your blood pumping, says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil,&lt;/a&gt; DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. “Brisk walking increase blood flow to your legs and gets your heart rate up,” he says. “Any time your heart rate goes up, the flow of blood to your head is increased.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise and movement in general is helpful for brain health, explains &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev,&lt;/a&gt; MD, medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University. “What’s good for the body is usually good for the brain,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want more walking inspo?

The researchers specifically wrote this: “Moving from ~1 minute of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day to ~6 minutes per day had the largest predicted differences in the domains of executive function/attentional control, processing speed, and working memory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is considered “brisk” walking?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brisk walking is basically any walk speed that gets your heart rate up. "Brisk walking involves moving at a pace where you notice an elevation in your heart rate and breathing rate, which reflects an increased intensity of physical activity," says &lt;a href="https://www.adventhealth.com/institute/adventhealth-research-institute/team/audrey-collins" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Audrey Collins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Audrey Collins&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, lead study author and a post-doctoral research scientist with AdventHealth. "For example, walking at a leisurely pace is representative of low-intensity physical activity, while brisk walking at a faster pace moves into a moderate-intensity level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, next time you’re short on time for a full workout, consider at least taking a quick walk around the block. It’ll do your brain health a solid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Clifton 9&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp

    &lt;p&gt;Conductor John Mauceri is no stranger to health struggles. He was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis in 2017, then chronic lymphocytic leukemia and interstitial lung disease in 2019. Medication treated the conditions and sent the cancer into remission, but he has remained on the lookout for recurrence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2024, Mauceri, then 78, contracted COVID-19. He struggled to climb the stairs and developed a "troublesome" cough. He went to the emergency room at NYU Langone, where he has previously received medical care. An X-ray found viral pneumonia and severe lung disease. Doctors removed three liters of liquid from his right lung. The only relief, he said, was that there was no trace of cancer. He left the hospital about a week later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within weeks, new symptoms quickly emerged. First, his left ankle swelled. Then the swelling continued up his leg. As the weeks passed, the swelling entered his abdomen and inched down his right leg. At one point, Mauceri was gaining a pound every day. He was also dealing with fatigue and shortness of breath. He couldn't conduct. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was wearing somebody else's body, at least from my waist down. I couldn't wear normal clothes," Mauceri said. "Putting shoes on was hard. I couldn't walk through my house." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one on his care team could identify what was causing the symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I had an oncologist, I had a pulmonologist, a rheumatologist. I had a lot of doctors, and they all thought it was somebody else's domain," Mauceri said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Searching for a diagnosis &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Adam Skolnick, a cardiologist at NYU Langone and one of Mauceri's doctors, said the team first looked for more common causes for the swelling. Mauceri underwent MRIs and other tests. An exam found his lymph system was working normally. Cardiac catheterization, where a thin tube is guided through the heart, found no signs of heart disease. There were no signs of blood clots, cancer recurrence or other likely conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the swelling was beginning to strain Mauceri's body, putting him at risk of multi-organ failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While studying the images of Mauceri's heart, Skolnick began to form a theory. But "the only definitive way to fully diagnose and treat Mr. Mauceri would be through surgery to open the chest," the doctor said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is pericardial constriction? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skolnick thought Mauceri might have pericardial constriction, which occurs when the sac around the heart, or the pericardium, is thickened by scarring. That prevents the heart from fully opening. It can create pressure, resulting in swelling in the legs and abdomen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a rare condition that is usually acquired because of a prior illness, Skolnick said, including viral infections like COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since there are no tests that look at the pericardium specifically, Mauceri would have to undergo open-heart surgery to confirm the diagnosis. The condition would also be treated in that same surgery. After Mauceri's care team eliminated all other possible options, they decided it was time to go into the operating room in June 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mauceri was nervous about the prospect but it seemed like his only option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was no alternative," he said. "I said, 'Well, let's just do it.'" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A high-risk surgery  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eugene Grossi, a cardiothoracic surgeon and leader of NYU Langone Heart's robotic surgery team, performed Mauceri's surgery. When he opened the conductor's chest, he found that Mauceri's "heart was trapped" inside a thick shell of scarring. Typically, the pericardium is like a paper bag. Mauceri's was like shoe leather, Grossi said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You don't think about it, but your lungs expand with every breath you take. Your chest wall opens. Your lungs expand. The heart does also, because it has to be able to accept the blood that's coming back from your arteries and veins. And his was just trapped," Grossi explained. That entrapment leads to fluid retention, creating swelling, Grossi said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the scarring, Mauceri's heart was functioning well. With the diagnosis made, Grossi and the surgical team had to scrape the pericardium and attached scar tissue carefully off the heart. Removing the pericardium creates no lasting health issues, but the procedure, called a pericardiectomy, is a delicate one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's almost like the heart is a hard-boiled egg, and we're peeling off the shell," Grossi said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mauceri's procedure went smoothly, his doctor said. Once the pericardium was removed, Mauceri's urine output bag began to fill, proving to the surgeons that the pressure was off and blood was pumping smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Every day is a miracle"   &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Mauceri was released from the hospital, he quickly began losing weight. He said he feels like he's in the best shape he's been since college. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is extraordinary because not only did I survive it, but I'm stronger than ever as a result of it," Mauceri said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His health struggles didn't end immediately. Shortly after the heart surgery, he was hospitalized again for a blockage of the small intestine. That was quickly treated, again at NYU Langone, but it slowed his recovery. It wasn't until December 2024, more than a year after he was diagnosed with COVID-19, that Mauceri was able to conduct an orchestra again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mauceri conducted back-to-back performances in London and Paris, getting used to being onstage again. In May, he traveled to Japan to conduct in Tokyo. The 13-hour flight and long performance days felt like the first test of his endurance after his illnesses, he said. The performance was a raging success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mauceri said he has no plans to slow down now that he's back to work. In between spending time with his family in New York City, he plans to travel the country for other concerts, including at the Hollywood Bowl in September, shortly after his 80th birthday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I was conducting as if I wasn't on the cusp of being 80 anymore," he said. "I was allowed to do that because my doctors gave me this added time in my life where I can do that. So every day is a miracle. Every day I'm grateful for what they did." &lt;/p&gt;

These inputs include sunset, sunlight, meals, social cues and physical activity that help mark where we are in a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are all what we call time givers, or they give time to the brain,” he said. In other words, they help the brain sense where it is in the 24-hour circadian cycle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, for a younger person, dinner time may help the brain understand that bedtime is in a few hours; for someone older, this connection may not happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nerves that are supposed to give the brain time cues have undergone the same amount of &lt;span&gt;degeneration as the brain, Parthasarathy said. T&lt;/span&gt;his inability to sense time cues is part of the reason why older people tend to get tired before their children or grandchildren. And, as a result, wake up fully rested and earlier than the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The light our eyes take in is part of it, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Interestingly, one of [the reasons] seems to be that the vision changes that come with age reduce the intensity of the degree of light stimulation that our brain receives, which plays an important role in ‘setting’ our circadian clock and keeping it on track,” Lustig said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parthasarathy explained that this is especially true for people with cataracts, a common eye condition that impacts more than 50% of Americans ages 80 and up, &lt;a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/cataracts" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to the National Institutes of Health" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b432ae4b095274facca2a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/cataracts" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;according to the National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;. Cataracts cause blurred vision, double vision and general trouble seeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If&lt;span&gt; there’s cataracts, the evening light doesn’t go into the eyes as much, so, according to the brain, sunset is earlier than when it actually set,” Parthasarathy said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter? Since there is less light getting into the eyes because of the vision issues cataracts cause, the body starts to release &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/melatonin" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="melatonin" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b432ae4b095274facca2a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/topic/melatonin" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;melatonin&lt;/a&gt; (the sleep hormone) earlier than it should. For younger people, melatonin “starts rising after sunset,” Parthasarathy said, which is why you generally feel tired a few hours after. &lt;span&gt;For people with cataracts whose brain thinks sunset was earlier, their perceived sunset is earlier, which makes them tired sooner in the evening. And going to bed sooner means waking up earlier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There is some evidence that cataract removal surgery can help improve sleep quality and duration by helping those light cues get through,” Lustig said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: LWA/Dann Tardif via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;LWA/Dann Tardif via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The amount of light your eyes take in each evening impacts when you're ready to go to sleep.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If this is you, there are a few steps you can take to sleep better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Parthasarathy, if you struggle with this issue, you should ignore the advice to put away the screens and instead expose yourself to bright light in the late evening. This can mean going for a walk outside before the sun sets, reading a book on a bright iPad, getting artificial lights for your home or watching TV on a bright screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;These bright lights will tell the brain that the sun hasn’t set yet, which will hold the melatonin production, he said. To help yourself stay up a little later (and sleep a little later as a result), Parthasarathy said you should try these things 30 to 60 minutes before sunset, which will vary depending on the time of year and where you live in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

            Infection-causing fungi responsible for millions of deaths a year will&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;spread significantly to new regions as the planet heats up, new &lt;a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6545782/v1" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; predicts&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— and the world is not prepared. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000b3b6madevfu4v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fungi are absolutely everywhere. A vast kingdom of organisms, from mold to mushrooms, they grow in environments such as soil, compost and water. They play an important role in ecosystems but can have a devastating impact on human health: Fungal infections kill an &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(23)00692-8/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;estimated 2.5 million people&lt;/a&gt; a year, and a lack of data means that number could be far higher.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000c3b6mjhfcv2ch@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yet we are still very far from understanding them, especially how these incredibly adaptable organisms will respond &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/09/climate/2024-hottest-year-record"&gt;to a warming climate&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000e3b6mxjc9n0a9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A team of scientists from Manchester University used computer simulations and forecasts to map the potential future spread of Aspergillus, a common group of fungi found all over the world that can cause aspergillosis, a life-threatening disease primarily affecting the lungs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000f3b6mpvok5bm4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They found certain Aspergillus species will expand their range as the climate crisis intensifies, pushing into new parts of North America, Europe, China and Russia. The study, published this month, is currently being peer reviewed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000g3b6mzcvtqmyt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Fungi are relatively under-researched compared to viruses and parasites, but these maps show that fungal pathogens will likely impact most areas of the world in the future,” said Norman van Rijn, one of the study’s authors and a climate change and infectious diseases researcher at the University of Manchester.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0wei30002i3b6mghcwbyjf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The field has seen new attention thanks to the popular HBO television drama “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/25/world/zombie-fungus-ophiocordyceps-the-last-of-us-scn"&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/a&gt;,” which follows people trying to survive in a world where an infectious mutant fungus has turned most of the population into violent monsters. (HBO and CNN share the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0wei30002j3b6mds1obbu4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s fiction, van Rijn said, but he hopes it will raise the profile of fungal infections&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that are killing millions in reality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000k3b6mlr03crll@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aspergillus fungi grow like small filaments in soils all over the world.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Like almost all fungi, they release huge numbers of tiny spores that spread through the air.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000l3b6mtpo31ztq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Humans inhale spores every day but most people won’t experience any health issues; their immune system clears them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000m3b6m8qsvu0ds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s a different story for those with lung conditions including asthma, cystic fibrosis and COPD, as well as people with compromised immune systems, such as cancer and organ transplant patients, and those who have had severe flu or Covid-19.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000n3b6mutejajyy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If the body’s immune system fails to clear the spores, the fungus “starts to grow and basically kind of eat you from the inside out, saying it really bluntly,” van Rijn said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9kod000o3b6m8g0c2e0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aspergillosis has very high mortality rates at around 20% to 40%, he said. It’s also very difficult to diagnose, as doctors don’t always have it on their radar and patients often present with fevers and coughs, symptoms common to many illnesses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0w3psi00263b6m31fma28r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fungal pathogens are also becoming increasingly resistant to treatment, van Rijn added. There are only four classes of antifungal medicines available.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe000q3b6m5oea2g0c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This all spells bad news as the climate shifts open up new areas for Aspergillus to colonize.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0v4x2j001i3b6m87ll1lwe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aspergillus flavus, a species that tends to prefer hotter, tropical climates, could increase its spread by 16% if humans continue burning large amounts of fossil fuels, the study found. It’s predicted to push into parts of northern America, northern China and Russia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0w56hf00283b6mrvayn1ax@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This species can cause severe infections in humans and is resistant to many antifungal medications. It also infects a range of food crops, posing a potential threat to food security. The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240060241" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; added Aspergillus flavus to its critical group of fungal pathogens in 2022 because of its public health impact and antifungal resistance risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe000t3b6mihcjfnoo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aspergillus fumigatus, which prefers more temperate climates, is predicted to spread northwards toward the North Pole as global temperatures rise. Its spread could increase by 77.5% by 2100, the study found, potentially exposing 9 million people in Europe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe000v3b6mpwmmxgiv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Conversely, temperatures in some regions, including sub-Saharan Africa, could become so hot they are no longer hospitable to Aspergillus fungi. This could bring its own problems, as fungi play an important role in ecosystems, including healthy soils.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe000w3b6mg33vq8ii@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As well as expanding their growing range, a warming world could also be increasing fungi’s temperature tolerance, allowing them to better survive inside human bodies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe000y3b6miw0w6cms@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Extreme weather events such as drought, floods and heatwaves can affect fungi, too, helping to spread spores over long distances. There have been spikes in fungal disease following natural disasters, such &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3620763/" target="_blank"&gt;as the outbreak&lt;/a&gt; after the 2011 tornado in Joplin, Missouri.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0vacg9001s3b6m7ny7em58@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new Aspergillus&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;study “rightfully shines a light on the threat of fungi that dwell in our natural environment and how under-prepared we are to cope with shifts in their prevalence,” said Elaine Bignell, co-director of the MRC Centre for Medical Mycology at the University of Exeter, who was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Many uncertainties remain, however, and there is still a huge amount of research to be done, she told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe00103b6mhskzz2pj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite the deadly nature of aspergillosis, there is a real lack of data on where the pathogen is in the environment and who gets infected, said Justin Remais, a professor of environmental health sciences at UC Berkeley, who was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe00113b6mkf33h6fj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He is leading a study of more than 100 million patients across the United States, which identified more than 20,000 aspergillosis cases between 2013 and 2023. The number of cases is increasing about 5% each year, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0wexbn002n3b6mivne2o96@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Fungal pathogens are becoming increasingly common and resistant to treatment, and we are only beginning to understand how climate change is contributing,” he told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe00143b6m9j3smscr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People are used to hearing about diseases caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites, but much less so fungal diseases, said Bignell. “There is a desperate need to reverse this trend given the lethality,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb0u9koe00153b6mgxsiubj5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Any of us in the future might be affected.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

The disruptions have caused new HIV infections to surge in recent months and threaten to derail plans to eradicate the virus as a public health threat by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In one stark case, the cuts have cast uncertainty over the rollout of a newly developed injectable that scientists have hailed as “the closest thing to a vaccine that we have ever had in HIV response”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"us-news","tags":[{"id":"us-news/usaid","type":"Keyword","title":"USAID"},{"id":"technology/elon-musk","type":"Keyword","title":"Elon Musk"},{"id":"society/aids-and-hiv","type":"Keyword","title":"Aids and HIV"},{"id":"world/world","type":"Keyword","title":"World news"},{"id":"campaign/email/tech-scape","type":"Campaign","title":"TechScape (newsletter signup)"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","type":"Keyword","title":"US news"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/news","type":"Tone","title":"News"},{"id":"profile/nick-robins-early","type":"Contributor","title":"Nick Robins-Early"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-tech","type":"Tracking","title":"US Tech"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/west-coast-news","type":"Tracking","title":"West Coast News"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"us-news/2025/may/24/musk-doge-hiv-aids","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="musk-says-his-cuts-did-no-defunding" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Musk says his cuts did no defunding&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Musk was projected 10ft tall above the stage at the Qatar Economic Forum this week as he gave a sweeping and combative video interview. The creator of the so-called “department of government efficiency”, who once boasted he had fed “USAID into the wood chipper”, found himself defending his cuts to humanitarian aid. Just days before, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/bill-gates-give-away-fortune-by-2045-200bn-worlds-poorest-2025-05-08/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt; had accused the world’s richest person of “killing the world’s poorest children”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In one especially fraught exchange with Bloomberg interviewer Mishal Husain, Musk rebuked a question about whether his cuts to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usaid" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;USAID&lt;/a&gt; had imperiled HIV/Aids programs and claimed he would “fix it right now” if any services had, in fact, been defunded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“First of all, the program, the Aids medication program, is continuing. So, your fundamental premise is wrong. It is continuing,” Musk said. “It is false. It’s false. It’s false.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Rather than Musk’s cuts leaving HIV/Aids programs intact, however, global health officials said that Doge’s efforts have in reality hampered their work worldwide and thrown the protection of large swaths of people from disease into disarray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="doges-dismantling-of-usaid-plunges-aids-services-into-chaos" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Doge’s dismantling of USAID plunges Aids services into chaos&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prior to Doge’s cuts and the Trump administration’s freeze on foreign aid, the US was involved in a wide range of HIV/Aids treatment and prevention programs across dozens of countries. The government implemented the majority of its operations through Pepfar, a USAID-funded program that has contributed more than $110bn to preventing and treating the virus since the initiative began in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Since Doge dismantled USAID in January, however, the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/mar/18/global-health-trump-usaid-cuts-hiv-aids-2030-drugs-vaccine-research-africa" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;future of Pepfar is uncertain&lt;/a&gt;, and many of its services are in jeopardy. A temporary waiver from the state department has allowed funding for some HIV/Aids programs to continue, but only those aimed at treating people who are already living with HIV, as well as pregnant or breastfeeding women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As a result, many prevention programs involving pre-exposure prophylaxis drugs, or Prep, ground to a halt without US funding. Even services that were allowed, such as testing and treatment, also stopped due to the disruption and confusion caused by Doge’s shutdown of USAID, according to the &lt;a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/02/1159901#:~:text=Thousands%20of%20individuals%20%2D%20women%2C%20young%20girls%2C,for%20HIV%20prevention%2C%20screenings%20for%20tuberculosis%20or" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;. People who showed up to receive testing or medicine often found that no one was there to give it to them, according to a UN health official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There were thousands of healthcare workers and community health workers, laboratorians and data clerks, for example, that immediately stopped work,” said Dr Angeli Achrekar, deputy executive director of the programme branch at the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and a former Pepfar official. “It’s not like you just turn on the light switch and all of a sudden these services start up again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The effects of the cuts have been almost immediate, according to Achrekar, and could roll back years of advancements in combating HIV infections. In Botswana, the number of people receiving Prep has decreased by half since last year. The 30,000 people in Mozambique who were receiving Prep at the end of last year recently went down to 19,000, according to a UN tally. In Zimbabwe, the number of people receiving Prep declined from 4,000 to 1,800 in the same time frame. In Nigeria, 850,000 condoms distributed in December went down to 300,000 by February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s country after country,” Achrekar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-miracle-drug-cast-into-uncertainty" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;A miracle drug cast into uncertainty&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The cuts to prevention programs have also caused confusion and uncertainty around the rollout of a highly anticipated new drug called Lenacapivir. The drug, which is under review at the US Food and Drug Administration, protects patients against HIV infection through a single shot given every six months. Two &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/breakthrough-2024" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;separate large trials&lt;/a&gt; across different populations have shown that it almost entirely blocks the risk of contracting the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-16" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-16" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;after newsletter promotion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s nearly 100% effective at stopping new infections,” Achrekar said. “It is the closest thing to a vaccine that we have ever had in the HIV response.” Other researchers have called it a “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jul/26/lenacapavir-drug-trial-linda-gail-bekker-treating-hiv-aids-africa-women-pregnancy" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;miracle&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Pepfar announced at the end of last year that it was partnering with The Global Fund, an international organization that finances global health programs, in an effort to roll out Lenacapivir to at least 2 million people within the next three years. Doge’s cuts have thrown a potential wrench in those plans, however, since the drug would fall under the category of preventative services that the tate department’s waiver says should no longer be funded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;At the Qatar Economic Forum this week, Musk insisted that medication programs were continuing, and, when confronted with the example of Lenacapivir, suggested he would restore its funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Which ones aren’t being funded? I’ll fix it right now,” Musk claimed, later adding: “If in fact this is true, which I doubt it is, then we’ll fix it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In response to Musk’s comments, UNAIDS &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/pressreleaseandstatementarchive/2025/may/20250521_PR_Musk_HIV_services" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;released a statement&lt;/a&gt; saying it was encouraged that he would review the crisis caused by halts to US funding. Musk has made similar pledges about restoring health programs that Doge cut in the past, however: in February, Musk said that efforts to prevent the spread of Ebola had been accidentally canceled but were then restored – a claim that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/26/elon-musk-ebola-prevention-usaid-doge/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;USAID officials said was false&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While the Global Fund waits to see what the Trump administration decides to do with Pepfar, it is hoping to carry on with its plans for Lenacapivir whether the US is involved or not. Losing Pepfar’s partnership would mean a huge decrease in funding, however, as well as Pepfar’s extensive connections to organizations that could help in administering the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We’re not backing off the ambition to deliver Lenacapivir to two million people if we can,” said Peter Sands, the executive director of the Global Fund. “The extent to which we can continue to do that in partnership with Pepfar is uncertain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Since the waiver was issued on 1 February there has been no clarity or new policy released on what the Trump administration plans to do with Pepfar. US partners working on prevention services have had their agreements terminated, while UNAIDS projects that if Pepfar’s treatment and prevention services are stopped entirely, it would result in an additional 6.6m HIV infections by 2029.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE10bkhxME1tTzMyWF82b0RNblRPSWMyVjR4SnlLV3RPME01NW1ZZnRvblgyeTd5S1M1LXZPZDF1amxHZnZyRXhmd19WNm5CdG9pbnRYcmhoQ2xGdHNKOFRWOVdVZjhZZ3BLbFo3X2ZWdDIwVVB4</guid></item><item><title>消防员分享了他在4期癌症诊断前注意到的“良性”症状，他说他感到“震惊，难以置信，愤怒” - AOL.com | Firefighter Shares 'Benign' Symptom He Noticed Before Stage 4 Cancer Diagnosis, Says He Felt 'Shock, Disbelief, Anger' - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxOaWlLTmIxcmFQU0N4Tm1rUEZUZXVCVmVWMTk1emtmMS1zOWd4TlhOVVRaZjZyQ0QxRmdRTW40SFh6QS13eWRnejBYSDlmNWVfcXNTTjVzZkpNcjZSSm9fVHpMZ0lrX0tyYWc0cGg2bE9XR0dPT1pkUE41dmI0Nk9iOU93?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A firefighter in Baltimore has shared the apparently innocuous symptoms he experienced before being diagnosed with stage 4 esophageal cancer on Valentine's Day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Dorsey, 56, told the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; that his swallowing issues were “very benign," but that his health issues "progressively just started getting worse, where it was very difficult to eat anything, basically, without regurgitating it back up"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You go through all those different stages of shock, disbelief, anger," he previously told WMAR 2 News of his reaction to the diagnosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A firefighter in Baltimore is speaking out about the "benign" symptom he noticed before he was diagnosed with stage 4 esophageal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Dorsey — who has worked for the Baltimore City Fire Department (BCFD) for 21 years, following in his father and grandfather's footsteps — learned of his diagnosis on Valentine's Day of this year, local ABC-affiliated station &lt;a href="https://www.wmar2news.com/local/firefighter-asks-for-community-support-in-fighting-stage-four-cancer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:WMAR 2 News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;WMAR 2 News&lt;/a&gt; previously confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While speaking to the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/22/health/firefighter-battling-stage-4-cancer-had-very-benign-symptom/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:New York Post;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the 56-year-old, who is currently on medical leave while undergoing chemotherapy, revealed some of the symptoms he noticed before the diagnosis, which also confirmed the disease had spread to his lymph nodes and liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firefighter, who is part of BCFD's Engine 57 team in Curtis Bay, said everything had been fine health-wise until he started to have some trouble swallowing in January, per &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told the outlet his issues were “very benign” at first, and sometimes he'd have to have a drink to help wash food down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;BCFD Engine 57/Facebook&lt;/p&gt; Baltimore City Fire Department Engine 57&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It progressively just started getting worse, where it was very difficult to eat anything, basically, without regurgitating it back up,” Dorsey said, per the publication. Subsequent tests revealed masses in his lower esophagus, lymph nodes and liver, &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt; noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outlet reported that Dorsey underwent routine check-ups every six months, and high blood pressure was his only concern before his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/esophageal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20356084" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, "Esophageal cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the esophagus.

Other reported symptoms include headaches, nausea, loss of appetite, and gastrointestinal issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NB.1.8.1 has demonstrated a higher transmissibility rate compared to some earlier variants. Preliminary data suggest that this variant has an enhanced ability to bind to human cells, potentially leading to increased infection rates. The variant has been detected in travelers arriving at major U.S. airports, including those in California, Washington, Virginia, and New York.

That’s because of a phytochemical called sulforaphane found in these veggies, which is known to help prevent numerous types of cancer in addition to prostate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silva adds that tomatoes and watermelon have one compound that has been found to be particularly protective against prostate cancer: lycopene. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332220306521" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research shows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that lycopene can not only slow the progression and growth of prostate cancer cells, but it also could provoke the death of prostate cancer cells. However, Brockton cautions that research is still limited on lycopene, and a strong link has not been established yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silva recommends eating at least five servings of whole fruits and vegetables daily to reap their cancer-protective effects—but the more you can eat, the better, she says. She advises keeping frozen fruits and vegetables—which are just as nutritious as fresh—stocked in your freezer to add into smoothies, oatmeal, or dinners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fill up on fiber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s another nutrient that fruits and vegetables have in common that has protective qualities against cancer: &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/2023/05/27/fiber-health-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber can help prevent cancer in numerous ways, experts say. Eating high-fiber foods—like whole grains, fruits, vegetables, beans, nuts, and seeds—can boost your gut health, which in turn strengthens your immune system, according to Brockton. A stronger immune system will give your body the tools to fight off potentially cancerous cells, he told &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3503404/#abstract1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:One study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; also found that eating high-fiber whole grains was able to lower risk of aggressive prostate cancer via the production of the sex-hormone binding globulin, which helps regulate androgen levels that influence prostate cancer growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Dietary Guidelines recommend that men consume about 28 to 34 grams of fiber per day, but Silva advises shooting for 35 grams. She recommends making easy swaps like brown rice for white rice or whole grain bread for white bread to boost your fiber intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Small changes like that can certainly help to move the needle,” Silva tells &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also reach for high-fiber foods like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oats, barley, quinoa, amaranth, bulgur, and millet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beans and lentils&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuts and seeds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocados&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leafy greens like kale, spinach, bok choy, and arugula&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apples and pears&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweet potatoes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Popcorn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add in omega-3s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some research also indicates that foods rich in &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/2022/10/05/omega-3s-brain-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:omega-3 fatty acids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; could also help slow the progression of prostate cancer.

data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Parents should always keep alcohol out of their children’s reach&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To gain some insight into this situation, we got in touch with &lt;span&gt;Andrew Misell, Director for Wales at &lt;a href="https://alcoholchange.org.uk/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link"&gt;Alcohol Change UK&lt;/a&gt;. He was kind enough to have a chat with &lt;strong&gt;Bored Panda&lt;/strong&gt; and discuss some of the biggest risks of minors having access to &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/before-after-quit-drinking/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One reason we have a legal purchase age of 18 for alcohol in the UK is that young people’s bodies are still growing and developing, and alcohol can cause long-lasting damage to a body that is not fully-grown,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alcohol will also have more effect on someone the smaller they are. So, children can become intoxicated much more easily than adults, and are at much higher risk of alcohol poisoning, which is sometimes fatal,” the expert explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The UK’s Chief Medical Officers say that an alcohol-free childhood is best,” Andrew continued. “That means no alcohol until at least 15 years of age; only very small amounts between the ages of 15 and 18, and never more than once a week.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So is it ever safe to keep alcohol under the same roof as children?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many, many adults keep alcohol at home. Obviously, if you have children, it’s sensible to keep alcoholic drinks out of their reach,” Andrew noted. “That said, one of the most common ways young people get alcohol isn’t stealing it from their parents, but being given it by them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This often happens because parents believe they can safely introduce their children to &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/before-after-sobriety-photos/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, because they want to include young people in family celebrations, or because they believe their youngsters will drink outside the home if not allowed to drink at home,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;“Building self-confidence and a sense of self-worth in children is the best way to help them avoid alcohol problems”&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="6-34" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/roommate-son-broke-in-room-stole-alcohol/?image_id=6-34.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Mom Thinks Her Kids Are Angels, Denies That Her Son Is An Alcohol Thief Until He Comes Home Drunk" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/roommate-son-broke-in-room-stole-alcohol/?media_id=6-34" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/6-34.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8728225" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/6-34.jpg" alt="Teen sitting outside with head in hands, reflecting on being blamed for tempting after sneaking into roommate’s room to steal alcohol" title="Teen sitting outside with head in hands, reflecting on being blamed for tempting after sneaking into roommate’s room to steal alcohol" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-person-sitting-on-a-bench-with-their-hands-on-their-face-2frm-_U6S1s" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt; maxim bober / Unsplash (not the actual photo)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, however, Andrew says there is no evidence that this approach works. “In fact, the younger someone starts drinking alcohol – in any setting – the more likely they are to develop an alcohol problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also asked the expert how &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/parenting/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;parents&lt;/a&gt; should approach the topic of alcohol with their kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rather than introducing children to alcohol by letting them try it, parents need to be talking with them honestly – when they think they’re old enough to understand – about what alcohol is, what it does, and why it’s not suitable for them,” he shared. “That conversation might feel awkward for us as parents, in that it may oblige us to think about how much we’re drinking and why.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the expert noted, “The truth is that helping young people have a healthy relationship with alcohol doesn’t always have much to do with alcohol itself. Building self-confidence and a sense of self-worth in children is the best way to help them avoid alcohol problems and a range of mental health issues later in life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span

having good relationships with the adults around them,” Andrew explained. “So, often the best thing parents can do is spend time with their children, answer their questions, listen to their concerns, and let them know that they’ll always have someone to turn to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Readers assured the author that they had done nothing wrong, and they joined in on the conversation to share more

(CREDIT: CC BY-SA 4.0)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of people around the world suffer from chronic low back pain, often finding relief only through temporary solutions like painkillers or invasive surgeries. However, groundbreaking research from &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:McGill University;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;McGill University&lt;/a&gt; offers new hope. Scientists have identified two promising drugs that tackle the underlying cause—senescent cells, also called "zombie cells."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What Are Senescent Cells?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senescent cells accumulate naturally with age or due to stress-induced damage, such as DNA injury, oxidative stress, or mitochondrial dysfunction. These cells refuse to die and instead release harmful substances known collectively as the &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/study-reveals-why-cells-more-180700939.html" data-ylk="slk:senescence;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;senescence&lt;/a&gt;-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SASP factors include inflammatory proteins, enzymes, and reactive molecules, which damage healthy tissue and accelerate degenerative diseases, including heart disease, cancer, osteoarthritis, and notably, low back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Representative images of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and CD11b immunoreactivity in the dorsal horn of sparc−/− mice (delineated in a dashed line). (CREDIT: Science Advances)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings are exciting because it suggests we might be able to treat back pain in a completely new way," explained Lisbet Haglund, senior author of the study and professor at McGill’s Department of Surgery. "By removing the cells driving the problem, not just masking the pain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Targeting the Root of Pain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their approach, the researchers conducted experiments using mice genetically engineered to develop symptoms similar to human &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/gel-derived-from-cow-mucus-could-revolutionize-spinal-cord-treatment/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:spinal degeneration;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;spinal degeneration&lt;/a&gt;. These mice lack a gene called SPARC, causing early spinal deterioration, inflammation, and chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers administered two drugs to these mice: o-vanillin, a natural compound extracted from turmeric, and RG-7112, an FDA-approved drug previously used in cancer treatments. Both drugs individually reduced pain, inflammation, and degeneration in spinal discs, but their combined use showed even more powerful results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were surprised that an oral treatment could reach the spinal discs, which are hard to access and present a major hurdle in treating back pain," Haglund remarked. This discovery highlights an exciting new possibility for effectively managing low back pain at its source, rather than simply addressing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How Do These Drugs Work?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drugs belong to a category known as &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/revolutionary-new-drug-could-extend-human-life-span-by-30/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:senolytics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;senolytics&lt;/a&gt;, which specifically target and eliminate senescent cells. RG-7112 works by inhibiting proteins involved in cell survival, making it easier for the body to clear away these harmful cells. On the other hand, o-vanillin, initially included almost by accident due to its known anti-inflammatory properties, surprisingly proved capable of removing senescent cells as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also observed improved quality in vertebral bones and significantly reduced expression of pain markers within the spinal cord. This comprehensive improvement underscores the drugs’ potential as transformative therapies for chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Treatment with senolytics resulted in increased IVD volume and improved bone quality. (CREDIT: Science Advances)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why This Research Matters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low back pain remains the leading cause of disability worldwide, resulting in substantial personal suffering and economic burden, exceeding $100 billion annually in the United States alone. Treatments addressing root causes rather than symptoms could dramatically shift how chronic pain conditions are managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is particularly promising because senescent cells not only worsen degeneration by releasing harmful substances but also trigger &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/researchers-develop-urine-test-early-160700895.html" data-ylk="slk:senescence;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;senescence&lt;/a&gt; in neighboring healthy cells, creating a damaging cascade. Eliminating these cells early could interrupt this destructive cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies demonstrated that genetic deletion of specific markers related to senescence, like the protein p16Ink4a, reduced cell accumulation and spinal degeneration. This evidence reinforces the strategy of using senolytics like RG-7112 and o-vanillin to prevent or even reverse damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Senolytics removed SnCs and improved IVD health. (CREDIT: Science Advances)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Future Prospects&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although these findings are promising, further studies are necessary to confirm these drugs’ effectiveness and safety in humans. Haglund and her team aim to modify o-vanillin chemically, making it more stable and effective over longer periods in the body. The potential applications extend beyond back pain, possibly benefiting patients suffering from arthritis, osteoporosis, and other age-related diseases driven by senescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The big question now is whether these drugs can have the same effect in humans," Haglund said. If successful, this research could pave the way for a new class of treatments that improve quality of life by directly targeting cellular aging and degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Comprehensive Study Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adr1719" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Science Advances;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Science Advances&lt;/a&gt; and authored by Matthew Mannarino, Hosni Cherif, Lisbet Haglund, and colleagues, provides detailed scientific evidence supporting the use of senolytic drugs for treating chronic back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;IVDs (L3-S1) from sparc−/− mice treated with senolytics or vehicle were isolated, and the release of 15 SASP factors was evaluated. (CREDIT: Science Advances)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the preclinical trial, mice showed reduced pain behaviors, improved spinal health, and diminished inflammatory markers after eight weeks of treatment. This suggests a promising new path forward for millions dealing with debilitating chronic pain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This advancement reflects a shift toward targeted, biology-based treatments that promise more effective and lasting relief than current symptomatic approaches. With continued research, therapies using RG-7112 and o-vanillin could transform the lives of people suffering from chronic low back pain and other painful degenerative conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: The article above provided above by &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Brighter Side of News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Brighter Side of News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like these kind of feel good stories?

&lt;p&gt;Cognitive decline is often seen as an unavoidable part of getting older. But new research suggests that it may not be as permanent as we once believed. A team of scientists from Brazil has identified a molecule in the brain that appears to reverse brain aging and could even cancel out the effects of Alzheimer’s disease in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The molecule is called hevin, and it is secreted by a type of brain cell known as an astrocyte. These star-shaped cells help maintain the connections between neurons. As we age, these connections tend to weaken, which contributes to memory loss and slower thinking. Hevin plays a key role in keeping these connections strong.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.14493"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers found that older mice, along with mice that showed signs of Alzheimer’s, had reduced levels of hevin in their brains. When scientists increased hevin production in these animals, their cognitive abilities improved. The mice performed better on memory tasks, and their brain activity indicated healthier synaptic function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="is-wp-image-block wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?quality=82&amp;amp;strip=all" alt="brain MRI" class="is-wp-image-block wp-image-6000995" srcset="https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?quality=82 2400w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;amp;quality=82 150w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;amp;quality=82 300w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;amp;quality=82 768w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;amp;quality=82 1024w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;amp;quality=82 1536w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;amp;quality=82 2048w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?resize=63%2C42&amp;amp;quality=82 63w" sizes="(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="is-wp-image-block wp-element-caption"&gt;The X-ray of the human brain close-up image Image source: merydolla / Adobe&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, boosting hevin did not affect the buildup of beta-amyloid plaques. These plaques are commonly linked to Alzheimer’s, but their role in causing the disease is still debated. This new research suggests that there may be other ways to &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/new-study-suggests-alzheimers-may-be-reversible/"&gt;target cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; without focusing solely on removing plaques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="bgr-newsletter-signup-form newsletter-signup-form black-bg"&gt;	&lt;h4&gt;Tech.

Much of the focus in neuroscience has traditionally been on neurons alone. By highlighting the role of these helper cells, the research opens up new directions for understanding how to reverse brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the findings are still early and based on animal studies, they offer hope for future treatments. Scientists believe that medications mimicking the effects of hevin could eventually help people &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/cognitive-decline-de-age-the-brain-stanford-study/"&gt;maintain or regain cognitive function&lt;/a&gt; later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the study adds to our growing understanding of how the brain changes with age and &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/disabling-internet-on-your-smartphone-may-actually-reverse-brain-aging/"&gt;how those changes might be slowed or even reversed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The travelers, who were arriving from Japan, South Korea, France, Thailand, the Netherlands, Spain, Vietnam, China and Taiwan, were tested from April 22 through May 12, CBS reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials in Rhode Island, Hawaii and Ohio have also reported cases of the NB. 1.8.1 variant, which has caused a rise in COVID cases and hospitalizations in Hong Kong and Taiwan, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="summary secondaryBox_summary__WyWVT"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;  WHAT NEWSDAY FOUND&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two cases of a new COVID-19 variant &lt;/strong&gt;known as NB. 1.8.1, which has spread rapidly in Asia, have been reported in New York, along with at least six other states.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While the variant does not appear to cause more severe illness&lt;/strong&gt; than other previous strains, state Health Department officials said it appears to be more contagious.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Trump administration announced this week&lt;/strong&gt; it would limit approval for seasonal COVID shots to seniors and children and younger adults with at least one high-risk health problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marissa Crary, a spokeswoman for the New York State Health Department, said there have been two reported cases of the NB. 1.8.1 strain in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to monitor for NB. 1.8.1 and all other circulating COVID variants," Crary said. "Although NB. 1.8.1 does not appear to cause more severe illness than other variants, it appears to be more contagious."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bruce Farber, chief of public health and epidemiology at Northwell Health, said there's no reason to believe the new variant will cause any more severe illness than previous mutations of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There have been a number of different circulating variants that have been reported over the last several years, and none of them have really panned out to be significantly different from the more recent variants that we've had," Farber said. "And for the most part, COVID rates have been low. The overwhelming majority of people who get COVID are not getting very ill. Deaths are dramatically down, and more people have died of flu this year than of COVID. And COVID rates in hospitals are really quite manageable and quite low."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CDC spokeswoman said the agency is "aware of reported cases of COVID-19 NB. 1.8.1 in China and is in regular contact with international partners. There have been fewer than 20 sequences of NB. 1.8.1 in the U.S. baseline surveillance data to date."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State health department data shows &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/fatalities-0" target="_blank"&gt;COVID deaths&lt;/a&gt; during the past 12 months have ranged from a high of 73 during the week ending Sept. 21 to as low as 10 during the week ending Dec. 14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Long Island, there are 68 patients currently hospitalized with COVID, including seven in the intensive care unit, &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/daily-hospitalization-summary"&gt;state data&lt;/a&gt; shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sharon Nachman, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at Stony Brook Children's Hospital, said while there are constantly new variants circulating, prior COVID exposure, including previous vaccinations, continue to provide some level of protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't know how significant the next variant will be," Nachman said. "We can suspect or project how difficult it will be and how many people get sick. But we don't yet have enough data from prior years to say it will be bad, not bad or will change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials with Pfizer and Moderna &lt;a href="https://www.newsday.com/business/fda-vaccines-covid-boosters-kennedy-y85095" target="_blank"&gt;told a panel of FDA vaccine advisers&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday that they recommended switching to a new COVID formula for the fall and winter seasons that would provide protection against LP. 8.1, the current dominant strain in the United States. The new formula would also boost protection against NB. 1.8.1, the drug manufacturers said at the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, FDA officials &lt;a href="https://www.newsday.com/business/vaccines-fda-kennedy-covid-shots-rfk-trump-d82467" target="_blank"&gt;announced Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that updated COVID shots would be available moving forward only to adults 65 and older, along with children and younger adults with at least one high-risk health problem — a break from previous federal policy that recommended annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency is urging companies to conduct large comprehensive studies before the tweaked vaccines can be approved for healthier people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farber said that while limiting the vaccine to the elderly and the vulnerable "makes some sense," health agencies need to flexible to adjust for changing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It may make sense now, but may not make sense in September, October, November of this year or the following year," Farber said of the FDA's vaccine standards. "And I think it would be a mistake for them to lock people out of getting these vaccines ... when we don't really know what the trajectory of the virus is going to be over the next year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;span class="author-image Byline_author-image__kHthS"&gt;&lt;img alt="Robert Brodsky" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AYmE4NjQ0OGItOGQ0NC00%3AOGItOGQ0NC00OWU5YmIw%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=96&amp;amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AYmE4NjQ0OGItOGQ0NC00%3AOGItOGQ0NC00OWU5YmIw%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=256&amp;amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AYmE4NjQ0OGItOGQ0NC00%3AOGItOGQ0NC00OWU5YmIw%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=256&amp;amp;q=75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;

These cells refuse to die and instead release harmful substances known collectively as the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-study-reveals-why-some-cells-are-more-susceptible-to-cancer-than-others/"&gt;senescence&lt;/a&gt;-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SASP factors include inflammatory proteins, enzymes, and reactive molecules, which damage healthy tissue and accelerate degenerative diseases, including heart disease, cancer, osteoarthritis, and notably, low back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Representative images of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and CD11b immunoreactivity in the dorsal horn of sparc−/− mice (delineated in a dashed line).

"By removing the cells driving the problem, not just masking the pain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="targeting_the_root_of_pain"&gt;Targeting the Root of Pain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their approach, the researchers conducted experiments using mice genetically engineered to develop symptoms similar to human &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/gel-derived-from-cow-mucus-could-revolutionize-spinal-cord-treatment/"&gt;spinal degeneration&lt;/a&gt;. These mice lack a gene called SPARC, causing early spinal deterioration, inflammation, and chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers administered two drugs to these mice: o-vanillin, a natural compound extracted from turmeric, and RG-7112, an FDA-approved drug previously used in cancer treatments. Both drugs individually reduced pain, inflammation, and degeneration in spinal discs, but their combined use showed even more powerful results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were surprised that an oral treatment could reach the spinal discs, which are hard to access and present a major hurdle in treating back pain," Haglund remarked. This discovery highlights an exciting new possibility for effectively managing low back pain at its source, rather than simply addressing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="how_do_these_drugs_work_"&gt;How Do These Drugs Work?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drugs belong to a category known as &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/revolutionary-new-drug-could-extend-human-life-span-by-30/"&gt;senolytics&lt;/a&gt;, which specifically target and eliminate senescent cells. RG-7112 works by inhibiting proteins involved in cell survival, making it easier for the body to clear away these harmful cells. On the other hand, o-vanillin, initially included almost by accident due to its known anti-inflammatory properties, surprisingly proved capable of removing senescent cells as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also observed improved quality in vertebral bones and significantly reduced expression of pain markers within the spinal cord. This comprehensive improvement underscores the drugs’ potential as transformative therapies for chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Treatment with senolytics resulted in increased IVD volume and improved bone quality.

Treatments addressing root causes rather than symptoms could dramatically shift how chronic pain conditions are managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is particularly promising because senescent cells not only worsen degeneration by releasing harmful substances but also trigger &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/researchers-develop-urine-test-for-early-detection-of-lung-cancer/"&gt;senescence&lt;/a&gt; in neighboring healthy cells, creating a damaging cascade. Eliminating these cells early could interrupt this destructive cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies demonstrated that genetic deletion of specific markers related to senescence, like the protein p16Ink4a, reduced cell accumulation and spinal degeneration. This evidence reinforces the strategy of using senolytics like RG-7112 and o-vanillin to prevent or even reverse damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Senolytics removed SnCs and improved IVD health.

Haglund and her team aim to modify o-vanillin chemically, making it more stable and effective over longer periods in the body. The potential applications extend beyond back pain, possibly benefiting patients suffering from arthritis, osteoporosis, and other age-related diseases driven by senescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The big question now is whether these drugs can have the same effect in humans," Haglund said. If successful, this research could pave the way for a new class of treatments that improve quality of life by directly targeting cellular aging and degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="comprehensive_study_findings"&gt;Comprehensive Study Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adr1719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Science Advances&lt;/a&gt; and authored by Matthew Mannarino, Hosni Cherif, Lisbet Haglund, and colleagues, provides detailed scientific evidence supporting the use of senolytic drugs for treating chronic back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;IVDs (L3-S1) from sparc−/− mice treated with senolytics or vehicle were isolated, and the release of 15 SASP factors was evaluated.

      &lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;Cass County reported two more cases Friday, bringing the total to six. Williams County remains steady with 13 cases.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The cases in Grand Forks County are related to international travel, according to a release from the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All cases involve unvaccinated individuals. One person in Cass County has been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One person with measles was contagious when flying into Williston, the release said. The public may have been exposed on United Airlines Flight 5293 from Denver to Williston on Wednesday, May 14, and at the Williston Basin International Airport between 10:22 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. that day, according to the release.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;“It is essential that individuals without immunity stay home and avoid contact with others for 21 days following exposure,” said Molly Howell, immunization director at North Dakota Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the state health department, most North Dakotans are vaccinated against measles, and the risk to the general public is low. People who were vaccinated as children and

      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious, viral illness that can be fatal, particularly for young children and those with compromised immune systems. Measles spreads through the air and can remain in a room and on surfaces for up to two hours. The virus can sometimes travel between floors through ventilation systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms often include a fever, cough, runny nose or eye irritation followed by a body-wide rash. There is no specific medical treatment for measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For information about measles, vaccination or local clinic availability, contact the Health and Human Services Immunization Unit at

                Our newsroom occasionally reports stories under a byline of "staff." Often, the "staff" byline is used when rewriting basic news briefs that originate from official sources, such as a city press release about a road closure, and which require little or no reporting. At times, this byline is used when a news story includes numerous authors or when the story is formed by aggregating previously reported news from various sources. If outside sources are used, it is noted within the story.

Not every man has 75 children across Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The case came to light when two families independently contacted their fertility clinics after their children developed cancers that appeared to be linked to a rare genetic variant. The European Sperm Bank, which had supplied the sperm, confirmed that the variant in a gene called TP53 was present in some of the donor’s sperm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The rare variant was not known to be linked to cancer at the time of donation in 2008, would not have been detectable using standard screening techniques, and the donor is understood to be in good health. However, analysis by Kasper’s lab concluded that the mutation was likely to cause Li-Fraumeni syndrome, one of the most severe inherited predispositions to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kasper said: “I analysed the variant using population and patient databases, computer prediction tools and the results of functional trials and came to the conclusion that the variant was probably cancer-causing and that children born from this donor should receive genetic counselling.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Simultaneously, a number of genetics and paediatric departments across Europe were investigating their own cases, leading to 67 children from 46 families in eight European countries being tested. The variant was found in 23 children, 10 of whom have been diagnosed with cancer, including cases of leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Children with the risk gene are advised to be monitored with regular whole-body MRI scans, MRI scans of the brain and, as adults, of the breast and ultrasound examination of the abdomen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The European Sperm Bank, which applies a worldwide limit of 75 families for each sperm donor, said more than 67 children had been conceived using the donor’s sperm, but that its policy was to not confirm exact numbers of children for a specific donor. It said all of the relevant clinics had been alerted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kasper said this remained a concern. “Is 67 the total? It’s a really good question that I’ve asked the sperm bank. They didn’t want to tell me the denominator of the births for this donor,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Nicky Hudson, of De Montfort University in Leicester, said the case highlighted the complexity of the challenges that could arise when human gametes were shipped between countries and used for large numbers of recipients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-12" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"morning-briefing","successDescription":"Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the very least we need better systems for tracking donor usage and of informing recipients of this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Julie Paulli Budtz, a spokesperson for the European Sperm Bank, said: “We are deeply affected by this case.” She said the donor had been thoroughly tested but that “it is scientifically simply not possible to detect disease-causing mutations in a person’s gene pool if you don’t know what you are looking for”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She added: “We welcome continued dialogue on setting an internationally mandated family limit and have advocated for this on several occasions. This is also why we have proactively implemented our own international limit of 75 families per donor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNVWI4RktSNDktZjNOaXNhM2M5YS1LT0lzU0FnRGVXNjlILW5TTDVPR21RZ1VxUzBZNExCUHQ4a2QzTk9oNl9nMEFFbkR0dnNnNFYwOTlEMWY4U3p4eTVnYXRsMmJrLS16T0ZDRFR2dzNESUZneGMzWEJ0UFVmY0tmUFZNWHM4ZXhlR2ZueDI2YWw</guid></item><item><title>一种类型的乳房X光检查被证明对乳房密集的女性更好-西雅图时报 | One type of mammogram proves better for women with dense breasts - The Seattle Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOUXE2WUVSaXE0T09vclhhR3dkTGVYTTl0cjlhWjJBSTMxbEN0bWRkOG9XVDVTMVpkOGF0b2NVaTViX3RURTZqWjBvdUpLVE1EZzY5V0pQSF94aFB5b0VzUVAtdUoxRjVwSk42UjdxTFM3VnE5LThGcWo5dmhDWXd2OW9zSGlBQzRRM056Rmw3RXQzM1lzamVGM0c3ZUNmdjdzODIxeE5OZ2hIXzA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOUXE2WUVSaXE0T09vclhhR3dkTGVYTTl0cjlhWjJBSTMxbEN0bWRkOG9XVDVTMVpkOGF0b2NVaTViX3RURTZqWjBvdUpLVE1EZzY5V0pQSF94aFB5b0VzUVAtdUoxRjVwSk42UjdxTFM3VnE5LThGcWo5dmhDWXd2OW9zSGlBQzRRM056Rmw3RXQzM1lzamVGM0c3ZUNmdjdzODIxeE5OZ2hIXzA?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;One type of mammogram proves better for women with dense breasts&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/stories/CAAqNggKIjBDQklTSGpvSmMzUnZjbmt0TXpZd1NoRUtEd2pjdDQzLURSRzNkcVhWOS1VLUhpZ0FQAQ?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US:en&amp;amp;oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;View Full Coverage on Google News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 21:30:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOUXE2WUVSaXE0T09vclhhR3dkTGVYTTl0cjlhWjJBSTMxbEN0bWRkOG9XVDVTMVpkOGF0b2NVaTViX3RURTZqWjBvdUpLVE1EZzY5V0pQSF94aFB5b0VzUVAtdUoxRjVwSk42UjdxTFM3VnE5LThGcWo5dmhDWXd2OW9zSGlBQzRRM056Rmw3RXQzM1lzamVGM0c3ZUNmdjdzODIxeE5OZ2hIXzA</guid></item><item><title>由认证培训师打造的最佳7天减肥步行计划- EatingWell | The Best 7-Day Walking Plan to Lose Visceral Fat, Created by Certified Trainers - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxPVkVZT2R0Qk1leDBmYXVIMHFYNllVTWVVZXdRbXR3OXJEOTBQdkhMelNjRV9XSkJuRDZEb2M1a3JWcDhMUHE0VktLSVlFRHgyUGtUTElzUGMzemdEWVB2aGFEWGEwZllVQWtwazlwUE1SZVhuNlpTOW5LRHpwQmZ3WDNn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exercise, including walking, is a great way to reduce visceral fat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Walking helps burn more calories and uses your fat stores for energy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start with 15 minutes daily at your own pace and work your way up as you see fit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Having adipose (fat) tissue in the body is completely normal &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;needed for certain bodily functions, such as hormone production. However, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292293/9-things-you-shouldnt-do-if-youre-trying-to-trim-belly-fat/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;excessive adipose tissue&lt;/a&gt;, mainly visceral fat, raises your risk for serious health conditions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, one effective way to reduce this fat is through movement. And you don’t need a gym membership or equipment, all it takes is lacing up your shoes and heading out the door to go for a walk. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this article, we spoke to two certified personal trainers who helped us create the best 7-day walking plan to lose visceral fat. We also explain just how walking works to reduce visceral fat and answer one of your most burning questions: how much do I really need to walk to see an effect? Let’s dive in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-your-walking-plan"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Your Walking Plan &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If there’s one mistake to avoid when starting a new fitness routine, it's going too hard and too fast. To see results and make a new habit stick, consistency is key, and one of the best ways to stay consistent is by pacing yourself. Overdoing it in a single session can leave you sore, burn out or worse, injured. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “A beginner-friendly walking plan designed to reduce visceral fat should focus on gradually increasing time and intensity to support consistency and motivation,” says &lt;a href="https://www.eehealth.org/healthy-driven/fitness-centers/services/personal-training/trainers/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Courtney Kuenn, M.S., CPT&lt;/a&gt;, a personal trainer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For each walk, Kuenn recommends completing it at a brisk pace. She recommends once or twice a week, adding short bursts of 1 to 2 minutes of fast walking to help stimulate fat burning. To add variety and challenge, you can also include stair walking or light hills into your walks. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And don’t skip light stretching and rest days too, they are just as important for recovery and injury prevention. “Each week, individuals can increase their total walking time by 5-10% or add more intervals to continue progressing toward their fat loss goals,” says Kuenn. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here’s a 7-day walking plan to lose visceral fat: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday: &lt;/strong&gt;15-Minute Walk &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday: &lt;/strong&gt;20-Minute Walk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday: &lt;/strong&gt;15-Minute Walk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday: &lt;/strong&gt;Rest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday: &lt;/strong&gt;25-Minute Walk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday: &lt;/strong&gt;30-Minute Walk &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday: &lt;/strong&gt;20-Minute Walk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-walking-helps-you-lose-visceral-fat"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Walking Helps You Lose Visceral Fat &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Walking is one of the most achievable forms of exercise, and the only real barrier is often our own motivation to get out the door. But the best part? You can walk almost anywhere (inside or outside), and at almost any time (though maybe not at 3 am, safety first!). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
First, walking helps you &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/activities-that-burn-as-many-calories-30-minute-walk-11727184" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;burn calories&lt;/a&gt;, which creates a calorie deficit. Kuenn explains: “When you walk, your body burns energy, and over time, consistent walking increases your daily calorie expenditure enough to promote fat loss, even if your diet remains the same.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Second, your body uses your fat stores for energy to walk. “Moderate intensity exercise relies mostly on fat for fuel,” says &lt;a href="https://danawhitenutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Dana Angelo White, M.S., RDN, ATC&lt;/a&gt;, a certified athletic trainer. She adds that walking is a great way to get cardiovascular exercise in the moderate-intensity zone. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;And you don’t need to be speedy to see results. One study found that slow walking led to more significant fat loss in individuals with overweight than fast walking, likely because participants could stick with the activity longer at a slower pace.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Walking can also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-reduce-insulin-resistance-for-better-blood-sugar-8750433" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;improve insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;, helping your body use glucose more efficiently rather than storing it as fat, Kuenn explains. “This is important because poor insulin function can lead to increased fat accumulation in the abdominal area.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Yet, walking also helps reduce visceral fat by helping &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8054352/6-fast-ways-to-lower-cortisol-levels/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower cortisol levels&lt;/a&gt;, your body’s stress hormone. “Elevated cortisol due to chronic stress is closely linked to visceral fat storage. Walking, especially in calming environments or as a mindfulness practice, can help lower cortisol levels,” says Kuenn. Research has shown that physical activity is an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-when-you-wake-up-for-healthy-cortisol-levels-8784363" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;effective strategy for reducing cortisol&lt;/a&gt; and even helps you sleep better. Poor or insufficient sleep can also lead to more visceral fat storage.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lastly, one common question trainers often hear is: Can I &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/can-you-target-losing-visceral-fat-8760072" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;spot train visceral fat&lt;/a&gt; away? White sets the record straight: “You can’t ‘spot train’ visceral fat with sit-ups and crunches, going for total body movement for calorie burn is how fat mass is truly lost.” Another win for walking!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-much-to-walk-to-reduce-visceral-fat"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Much to Walk to Reduce Visceral Fat &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;White says you don’t need to walk for &lt;em&gt;hours&lt;/em&gt; each day to see results. For beginners, the sweet spot to shoot is 30-60 minutes daily. But remember, this doesn’t have to be all in one stretch of time. Breaking up your daily goal of 30 minutes into 10-minute chunks can make it easier to hit. For example, try to do 10 minutes in the morning, 10 minutes during a mid-day break and your last 10 minutes in the evening. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;And if the weather has other plans, you can still stay on track by walking on a treadmill, climbing a flight of stairs or simply taking a day to stretch. Slowly over time, you can work your way up to 150 to 300 minutes of walking per week, which aligns with public health recommendations, adds Ruenn. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Pairing your walking plan with a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy (non-restrictive) diet&lt;/a&gt; can help you achieve results in a more sustainable way. And it doesn't have to be a huge overhaul of your current diet. It's best to do it in a healthy, slow and progressive manner too. You might start by adding at least &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-you-should-start-to-lose-visceral-fat-11698263" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;two veggies&lt;/a&gt; to lunch and another two to dinner. Or swap out a sugary soda or sweetened coffee drink for a no-sugar-added option. And add &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-to-buy-if-you-want-to-lose-visceral-fat-8785221" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;foods that can support visceral fat loss&lt;/a&gt; to your shopping cart the next time you hit the grocery store.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Walking is the perfect exercise to help reduce visceral fat. It can be done from almost anywhere and even at your own pace. When done consistently, walking can help reduce visceral fat by burning calories, using fat stores, improving insulin function, lowering cortisol levels, and even helping you sleep better. Certified personal trainers recommend aiming for 30-60 minutes of walking about five days a week. You can add an extra challenge by incorporating bursts of faster walking, hills or stairs. Pair your walking routine with a healthy diet, and you’ll feel your best!&lt;br&gt;

          &lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t seen this in major media yet (except CBS), nor here, but this story is spreading on Facebook and in Europe today: (CBS) &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-reports-cases-new-covid-variant-nb-1-8-1-behind-surge-china/" target="_blank" title=""&gt;U.S. reports cases of new COVID variant NB.1.8.1 behind surge in China&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention/" target="_blank" title=""&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;'s airport screening program has detected multiple cases of the new &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/feature/coronavirus/" target="_blank"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; variant NB.1.8.1, which has been linked to a large surge of the virus in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cases linked to the NB.1.8.1 variant have been reported in arriving international travelers at airports in California, Washington state, Virginia and the New York City area, according to records uploaded by the CDC's airport testing partner Ginkgo Bioworks. . . .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cases of NB.1.8.1 have also now been reported by health authorities in other states, including Ohio, Rhode Island and Hawaii, separate from the airport cases. In California and Washington state, the earliest cases date back to late March and early April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts have been &lt;a href="https://github.com/neherlab/SARS-CoV-2_variant-reports/blob/main/reports/variant_report_latest_draft.md#global-overview" target="_blank"&gt;closely watching&lt;/a&gt; the variant, which is now dominant in China and is on the rise in parts of Asia. Hong Kong authorities say that rates of COVID-19 in the city have climbed to the worst levels they have seen in at least a year, after a "significant increase" in reported emergency room visits and hospitalizations driven by COVID-19.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good to see the CDC is still on the job (NO snark intended).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Daily Express (US version) is also alarming: &lt;a href="https://www.the-express.com/news/health/172633/new-covid-19-variant-nb181-detected-china-us-airports" target="_blank" title=""&gt;New Covid variant lands in US after ripping through countries, killing some in Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is yet to be evidence that this new variant is more severe, but authorities in Hong Kong say they have already begun urging locals to wear masks in crowded places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan has also reported a rise in emergency room visits, including severe cases and deaths, and the country's health authorities have said they are stockpiling vaccines and antiviral treatments in response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, The Food and Drug Administration’s advisory committee unanimously recommended that the newest vaccines for Covid should be updated to target a variant of strains currently on the rise, including NB.1.8.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meeting on Thursday was the first the Administration has had since President Trump took office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The (UK) Economic Times also has some details: &lt;a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/covid-variant-nb-1-8-1-spreading-in-u-s-is-it-more-dangerous-do-vaccines-work-and-whats-the-fatality-rate/articleshow/121369143.cms" target="_blank" title=""&gt;COVID variant NB.1.8.1 spreading in U.S.: is it more dangerous, do vaccines work, and what's the fatality rate?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answers: It does not &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt; to be more severe than previous variants, but it spreads more rapidly. Also, “Early data suggests that updated vaccines targeting related variants such as LP.8.1 may be beneficial.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, there is no sign that NB.1.8.1 causes more severe illness than previous strains. But what it lacks in evasiveness, it may make up for in speed. Early research from China suggests the variant binds more effectively to human cells, which could make it more contagious than its predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By coincidence, during a routine exam last week my doctor suggested getting a COVID booster, which I did. Consult your doctor or other health care to consider doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;

Kennedy Jr., Rep. Laura Friedman (D-Glendale) and 22 of her House colleagues demanded the release of HIV funding allocated by Congress but withheld by the Trump administration. They cited estimates from the Foundation for AIDS Research, known as amfAR, that the cuts could lead to 143,000 additional HIV infections nationwide and 127,000 additional deaths from AIDS-related causes within five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friedman said the effects would be felt in communities small and large across the country but that California would be hit the hardest. She said L.A. County — which stands to lose nearly $20 million in annual federal HIV prevention funding — is being forced to terminate contracts with 39 providers and could see as many as 650 new cases per year as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to amfAR, that would mark a huge increase, pushing the total number of new infections per year in the county to roughly 2,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“South L.A. and communities across California are already feeling the devastating impacts of these withheld HIV prevention funds. These cuts aren’t just numbers — they’re shuttered clinics, canceled programs, and lives lost,” Friedman said in a statement to The Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one example, she said, the Los Angeles LGBT Center — which is headquartered in her district — would likely have to eliminate a range of services including HIV testing, STD screening, community education and assistance for patients using pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, a medicine taken by pill or shot that can greatly reduce a person’s risk of becoming infected from sex or injection drug use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A list reviewed by The Times of L.A. County providers facing funding cuts included large and small organizations and medical institutions in a diverse set of communities, from major hospitals and nonprofits to small clinics. The list was provided by a source on the condition of anonymity in order to be candid about the funding of organizations that have not all publicly announced the cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The affected organizations serve a host of communities that already struggle with relatively high rates of HIV infection, including low-income, Spanish speaking, Black and brown and LGBTQ+ communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to L.A. County, the Trump administration’s budget blueprint eliminates or reduces a number of congressionally authorized public health programs, including funding cuts to the domestic HIV prevention program and the Ryan White program, which supports critical care and treatment services for uninsured and underinsured people living with HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The county said the cuts would have “an immediate and long-lasting impact” on community health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dozens of organizations and hospitals, such as Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles, are bracing for the disruption and potential vacuum of preventative services they’ve been providing to the community since the 1980s, according to Claudia Borzutzky, the hospital’s Chief of Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Borzutzky said without the funding, programs that provide screening, education, patient navigation and community outreach — especially for at-risk adolescents and young adults — will evaporate. So, too, will free services that help patients enroll in insurance and access HIV prevention medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients who “face a variety of health barriers” and are often stigmatized will bear the brunt, she said, losing the “role models [and] peer educators that they can relate to and help [them] build confidence to come into a doctor’s office and seek testing and treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are having to sunset these programs really, really quickly, which impacts our patients and staff in really dramatic ways,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Answers to queries sent to other southern California health departments suggested they are trying to figure out how to cope with budget shortfalls, too. Health officials from Kern, San Bernardino and Riverside counties all said the situation is uncertain, and that they don’t yet know how they will respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friedman and her colleagues — including fellow California representatives Nancy Pelosi, Judy Chu, Gilbert Cisneros Jr., Robert Garcia, Sam Liccardo, Kevin Mullin, Mark Takano, Derek Tran and George Whitesides — said they were concerned not only about funding for programs nationwide being cut, but also about the wholesale dismantling or defunding of important divisions working on HIV prevention within the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They questioned in their letter staffing cuts to the National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as “the reported elimination” of the Division of HIV Prevention within that center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to demanding the release of funds already allocated by Congress, the representatives called on Kennedy — and Dr. Debra Houry, deputy director of the CDC — to better communicate the status of ongoing grant funding, and to release “a list of personnel within CDC who can provide timely responses” when those groups to whom Congress had already allocated funding have questions moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although Congress has appropriated funding for HIV prevention in Fiscal Year 2025, several grant recipients have failed to receive adequate communication from CDC regarding the status of their awards,” Friedman and her colleagues wrote. “This ambiguity has caused health departments across the country to pre-emptively terminate HIV and STD prevention contracts with local organizations due to an anticipated lack of funding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter is just the latest challenge to the Trump administration’s sweeping cuts to federal agencies and to federal funding allocated by Congress to organizations around the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a series of executive orders and with the help of his billionaire adviser Elon Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency” and other agency heads, Trump in the first months of his second term has radically altered the federal government’s footprint, laying off thousands of federal workers and attempting to claw back trillions of dollars in federal spending — to be reallocated to projects more aligned with his political agenda, or used to pay for tax cuts that Democrats and independent reviewers have said will disproportionately help wealthy Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta’s office has repeatedly sued the Trump administration over such moves, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-05-05/california-other-states-sue-to-block-trump-administration-cuts-to-health-department"&gt;including cuts and layoffs within Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; broadly and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-04-01/california-sues-over-cuts-to-cdc-infectious-disease-funding"&gt;cuts to grants intended to make states more resistant to infectious disease&lt;/a&gt; specifically — calling them unwise, legally unjustifiable and a threat to the health of average Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LGBTQ+ organizations also have sued the Trump administration over orders to preclude health and other organizations from spending federal funding on diversity, equity and inclusion programs geared toward LGBTQ+ populations, including programs designed to decrease new HIV infections and increase healthy management of the disease among transgender people and other vulnerable groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The orders seek to erase transgender people from public life; dismantle diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives; and strip funding from nonprofits providing life-saving health care, housing, and support services,” said Jose Abrigo, the HIV Project Director of Lambda Legal, in a statement. The legal group has filed a number of lawsuits challenging the Trump administration cuts, including one on behalf of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation and other nonprofits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has defended his cuts to the federal government as necessary to implement his agenda. He and his agency leaders have consistently said that the cuts target waste, fraud and abuse in the government, and that average Americans will be better served following the reshuffling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has consistently defended the changes within Health and Human Services, as well. Agency spokespeople have said the substantial cuts would help it focus on Kennedy’s priorities of “ending America’s epidemic of chronic illness by focusing on safe, wholesome food, clean water, and the elimination of environmental toxins.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We aren’t just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic,” Kennedy has said. “This Department will do more — a lot more — at a lower cost to the taxpayer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has repeatedly spread misinformation about HIV and AIDS in the past, including by giving credence to the false claim that HIV does not cause AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As recently as June 2023, Kennedy told a &lt;a class="link" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/robert-f-kennedy-jr-2024-presidential-campaign-democratic-primary.html" target="_blank"&gt;reporter for New York Magazine&lt;/a&gt; that there “are much better candidates than H.I.V. for what causes AIDS,” and he has previously suggested that environmental toxins and “poppers” — an inhalant drug popular in the gay community — could be causes of AIDS instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of that is supported by science or medicine. Studies from around the world have proven the link between HIV and AIDS, and found it — not drug use or sexual behavior — to be the only common factor in AIDS cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials in L.A. County said they remained hopeful that the Trump administration would reverse course after considering the effects of the cuts — and the “detrimental impacts on the health and well-being of residents and workers across” the county if they are allowed to stand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 20:47:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNSzZ1alBkbG8zVl9FejlDVG1PQzdqcFROczNBX2ZrRVJwa1UzbjEtNHhtZllZZEZwWWdrWDM2dDVZaC10YjdMU192aE53T3ozM2E4NzVqUmQxQ3dTaTh1YWpzU05Iek02NjI5V1FRbjNhN19Wb0Y3T2RYdmZtaFo3UENBdmV3ejJtRG1ITHI3LXRxenYzbU43X0FKajUxaVh1UThIVXEtc2E4WlAt</guid></item><item><title>科学家们终于证实了1958年关于维生素B1的“疯狂”假设- Earth.com | Scientists finally confirm the 'crazy' hypothesis about vitamin B1 from 1958 - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxOaEZzRllkUmU0cHV5T19YTEx6UXBIYlItdG9reUI0TnA4V2poaEdBQTBCaFQ2Ni1JUlo5ZkdOcG1maHY3cDlTTl92ak5qVzl4WTJtOFBNZFdaWXZ6Rk5zMm9JdzFtY1d3NTdRVlNxVVJQMHpGSTlSeFROcUZvdGtXMkRib0N3WFBGeGcxaVVQNlFjOUw3MmVjR0NlaEZoX1lYUWkwaQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists once dismissed a 1958 hypothesis about vitamin B1, or thiamine, as unlikely. The idea was that this vitamin, vital for basic metabolic functions, might turn into a very reactive intermediate during certain biochemical processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers have shown that the hunch was correct. &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/vincentl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Prof. Vincent Lavallo&lt;/a&gt; from the University of California, Riverside (&lt;a href="https://www.ucr.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCR&lt;/a&gt;), led the investigation that confirms vitamin B1 can form a reactive species called a carbene, even in watery surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-vitamin-b1-and-carbenes"&gt;Understanding vitamin B1 and carbenes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja00001a054"&gt;Carbenes&lt;/a&gt; have only six valence electrons on the carbon atom. They are known for being so reactive that they often vanish moments after forming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water, which normally disrupts these molecules almost instantly, was never thought to be a friendly environment for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first time anyone has been able to observe a stable carbene in water. People thought this was a crazy idea. But it turns out, Breslow was right,” said Lavallo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thiamine is key to &lt;a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/b16594/introduction-nutrition-metabolism-david-bender" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;fundamental tasks&lt;/a&gt; in the body, including the breakdown of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/bumblebees-choose-immediate-rewards-over-energy-efficiency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sugars for energy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-so-much-doubt-for-so-long"&gt;Why so much doubt for so long?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbenes were long considered too unstable for water because of how quickly they react. Even trace moisture in the air could destroy them before scientists had a chance to study them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most early attempts to observe carbenes in water ended in failure. They either disappeared or broke apart into other &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/water-molecule-discovery-will-force-textbooks-to-be-rewritten/"&gt;molecules&lt;/a&gt;, reinforcing the belief that they simply couldn’t last in water-based systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That skepticism ran deep. Researchers preferred to work with these molecules in dry, oxygen-free environments using special lab setups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This made the idea of observing them in water, let alone storing them, sound like science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-fresh-approach-to-working-in-water"&gt;A fresh approach to working in water&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A carbene in water seemed &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cr400640e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;impossible&lt;/a&gt; because water usually attacks such electron-poor carbon centers right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were making these reactive molecules to explore their chemistry, not chasing a historical theory, but it turns out our work ended up confirming exactly what Breslow proposed all those years ago,” said &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Varun-Tej-Raviprolu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Varun Raviprolu&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral researcher at UCLA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and his colleagues developed a special chemical covering – a molecular shield – to keep the carbene from making contact with water. This shield prevented immediate breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1958-theory-turned-out-to-be-true"&gt;1958 theory turned out to be true&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemist &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja01547a064" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ronald Breslow&lt;/a&gt; suggested ages ago that thiamine might transform into a carbene during certain body reactions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one could prove it. The new findings show that under the right conditions, the carbene form of vitamin b1 is stable enough to observe with advanced tools like &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-can-now-trace-forever-chemicals-back-to-their-sources/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nuclear magnetic resonance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers say this stability helps explain how crucial transformations occur in living cells. Their protective strategy shows that the body could be forming short-lived carbene intermediates during routine metabolic tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eco-friendly-b1-manufacturing"&gt;Eco-friendly B1 manufacturing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These carbenes can serve as ligands in metal-based catalysts, which are widely used to produce many substances. Carbenes in water may open a path to cleaner processes, thanks to reduced dependence on harmful solvents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Water is the ideal solvent – it’s abundant, non-toxic, and environmentally friendly. If we can get these powerful catalysts to work in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/water-molecule-discovery-will-force-textbooks-to-be-rewritten/"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, that’s a big step toward greener chemistry,” said Raviprolu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These catalysts could transform how pharmaceuticals and everyday materials are produced. Some industry reactions are notorious for generating chemical waste. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By harnessing water-based techniques, the hope is to cut costs and avoid safety concerns linked to flammable liquids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mimicking-life-s-chemistry-in-the-lab"&gt;Mimicking life’s chemistry in the lab&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living cells rely on complex, water-based reactions to keep the body running. Many of those reactions involve fast, reactive intermediates that are hard to detect or replicate in a lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that Lavallo’s team managed to stabilize a molecule that mimics this behavior could help researchers recreate cellular chemistry more accurately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means a better grasp of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cruelty-free-foie-gras-made-with-enzymes-not-force-feeding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;how enzymes work&lt;/a&gt; and possibly new ways to repair or reprogram those functions in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbenes are often studied for their ability to mimic parts of enzyme action. Now that scientists can make them behave in watery environments, they might start finding ways to control them for specific biological tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could eventually change how we design &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/spider-venom-has-hidden-biochemical-value/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;enzyme-inspired&lt;/a&gt; drugs or materials that react only under the same conditions found inside human cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-next-steps-with-vitamin-b1"&gt;Next steps with vitamin B1&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proving that carbene intermediates can survive in water solves a riddle about &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tomatoes-could-become-an-important-source-of-vitamin-d/"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; b1’s potential. It also raises new questions about other fleeting molecules that may exist in living systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lavallo and his team hope that a similar method might reveal more hidden players involved in major biological reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Something that seems impossible today might be possible tomorrow, if we continue to invest in science,” said Raviprolu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding suggests that nobody should dismiss theories, no matter how far-fetched, without thorough research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adr9681" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 20:45:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOaEZzRllkUmU0cHV5T19YTEx6UXBIYlItdG9reUI0TnA4V2poaEdBQTBCaFQ2Ni1JUlo5ZkdOcG1maHY3cDlTTl92ak5qVzl4WTJtOFBNZFdaWXZ6Rk5zMm9JdzFtY1d3NTdRVlNxVVJQMHpGSTlSeFROcUZvdGtXMkRib0N3WFBGeGcxaVVQNlFjOUw3MmVjR0NlaEZoX1lYUWkwaQ</guid></item><item><title>通过简单的早餐降低胆固醇-心脏健康的“首选” - Surrey Live | Lower cholesterol with simple breakfast - 'top choice' for heart health - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxNUUVnRXhGa3V3VVpteXdyQmxPNmt0SVNwcGdQQXpnZDFibktkRlZmNXI3eFFiY0hMUWJYMUFoQlpuVmFYY2ZORGRCdmlvUEhuT245Rlp5dUFyZUtqMmFDTlZBd0paZ1pSTHE2YnZDZVpPYUxIanRSV3VLd2UxMFpHNDJFYzZNSGtUdHBXS3JuNGTSAZYBQVVfeXFMUHpaY2R3OFNXWmxtZGwtV09ENHJ3N1ZhQzUtb0RRVkUwaTZxRDl0T1NSTkRSQkJxWWJSaXhEdmdsaG5BYmpiVDdJSG5NeDlBU2NNZjdMU21XRURDdlptMFptRjZITXJ2Tm9lTzlRSEFYNjFQZl9nZ0o4V2FxdC1yLVRUNi1OWnlIeG1FYy10LXA2NzRDZVZ3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt; Health experts have suggested a straightforward, fibre-rich breakfast that could aid in reducing cholesterol levels. The &lt;a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/nutrition/breakfast-cereals-ranked-best-to-worst" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;British Heart Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (BHF) has hailed this wholesome dish as a "top choice" for maintaining cardiac health. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Elevated cholesterol indicates an excessive amount of the fatty substance known as cholesterol within your bloodstream. While the body needs some cholesterol to function optimally, too much can cause arterial blockages and hardening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If left unaddressed, this can result in a condition called atherosclerosis, significantly increasing the risk of heart attacks or strokes. Therefore, it's crucial to keep cholesterol levels in check.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Diet plays a pivotal role in managing cholesterol. Foods laden with saturated fats are notorious for boosting cholesterol, but certain foods can actually have the reverse effect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Foods high in fibre, particularly soluble fibre, are beneficial in this regard. Soluble fibre attaches itself to cholesterol during digestion, preventing its absorption into the blood and aiding in its expulsion from the body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The BHF suggests incorporating porridge into your morning routine to increase your soluble fibre intake. A single serving of porridge contains more than half the recommended daily amount of soluble fibre necessary to influence cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On its website, the BHF said: "Porridge is our top choice for a heart-healthy breakfast, made with low-fat milk or water. All porridge oats are wholegrains and they contain a soluble fibre called beta-glucan, which can help lower your cholesterol level if you have 3g or more daily, as part of a healthy diet."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The BHF also pointed out: "A 40g serving of porridge oats contains 1.6g of beta-glucan." Adding to its virtues, porridge naturally has no hidden sugar or salt, both of which are unfavourable for heart health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Further commenting, the BHF added: "As well as beta-glucan, you'll be getting the fibre from the whole grains, plus there is no added sugar or salt." It suggests enhancing the nutritional benefit of porridge by topping it with fruit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rather than sprinkling sugar or salt for taste, the foundation advises: "Instead of adding sugar or salt to your porridge for flavour, instead, try adding a banana or other fruits for extra sweetness," and that "For every 80g that you add it will be one of your five-a-day at the same time."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt; Especially for those dealing with high cholesterol, berries might just be the superior porridge accompaniment. Experts at &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/11-foods-that-can-help-lower-your-cholesterol" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Harvard Health&lt;/a&gt; said: "Because these fruits are packed with tiny seeds, their fibre content is higher than most other fruits." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They continue, specifying that "Raspberries and blackberries provide the most, but strawberries and blueberries are also good sources."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To manage your cholesterol, the &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; recommends: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Adopting a healthy, balanced diet&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Reducing saturated fat intake&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Engaging in more physical activity&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Quitting smoking&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Moderating alcohol consumption.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have worries about your cholesterol levels, it's advisable to consult with your GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 19:38:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNUUVnRXhGa3V3VVpteXdyQmxPNmt0SVNwcGdQQXpnZDFibktkRlZmNXI3eFFiY0hMUWJYMUFoQlpuVmFYY2ZORGRCdmlvUEhuT245Rlp5dUFyZUtqMmFDTlZBd0paZ1pSTHE2YnZDZVpPYUxIanRSV3VLd2UxMFpHNDJFYzZNSGtUdHBXS3JuNGTSAZYBQVVfeXFMUHpaY2R3OFNXWmxtZGwtV09ENHJ3N1ZhQzUtb0RRVkUwaTZxRDl0T1NSTkRSQkJxWWJSaXhEdmdsaG5BYmpiVDdJSG5NeDlBU2NNZjdMU21XRURDdlptMFptRjZITXJ2Tm9lTzlRSEFYNjFQZl9nZ0o4V2FxdC1yLVRUNi1OWnlIeG1FYy10LXA2NzRDZVZ3</guid></item></channel></rss>
