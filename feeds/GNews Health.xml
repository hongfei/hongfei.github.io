Discover why they should be avoided and which healthy practices you should turn to instead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c94685" class="body-graf"&gt;The liver is a remarkable organ. Among its many functions, it rids our blood of toxins, disposes of old cells, metabolizes nutrients and creates the fluid necessary for digestion. And it rarely needs assistance with any of its hundreds of jobs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-57db7c" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, a host of cleanses and supplements are available online and in stores, with claims they can detoxify the liver, thereby improving its function. But there’s no clinical evidence to support that they work, Dr. Raymond Chung, chief of gastroenterology, hepatology and endoscopy at Mass General Brigham, tells TODAY.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3a2597" class="body-graf"&gt;In fact, some have been linked to liver damage and failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-449556" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never Have I Ever: Done a Liver Cleanse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-537b2d" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s only natural to think that being good to our bodies is to find things like supplements that ostensibly reduce the stress to our livers,” Chung tells TODAY.com. But your liver likely doesn’t need any additional help, which is why he’s never done a liver cleanse or taken a liver supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-de45b3" class="body-graf"&gt;Plus, he has safety concerns around the many products that are available. That's in part because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't vet the safety of dietary supplements before they hit shelves (though it can take action against supplement makers after if a dangerous one reaches the market).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b62db8" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/bad-supplements-list-rcna209561" target="_blank"&gt;Certain types of supplements can be especially risky&lt;/a&gt; to liver health, such as black cohosh, kava and vitamin A, TODAY.com previously reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-ac8263" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-056ce5" class="body-graf"&gt;While the liver can incur damage from disease, viruses and lifestyle choices, a detox likely won’t be the fix — and in some cases, they may even make things worse. “Several herbal and dietary supplements have been linked to liver injury, damage or even liver failure,” Chung points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aa4bd9" class="body-graf"&gt;“The liver is the ultimate filter and the ultimate detoxifier,” he adds, but taking supplements can actually “overwhelm that detoxification mechanism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-8a7bec" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to Do Instead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d1cb86" class="body-graf"&gt;If you’ve already taken liver cleanses and supplements, don’t fret. “(The liver) is a sturdy, hardy organ,” with regenerative capacities, says Chung. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-25aec0" class="body-graf"&gt;To keep it functioning at its best, avoid liver supplements and focus on a few lifestyle practices, he advises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-44d9cf" class="body-graf"&gt;“The good news about the liver is that it is such an extraordinarily forgiving organ,” says Chung. “So even if liver damage somehow occurred during the period of exposure to a supplement, in most cases, with removal of the injurious agent, we will see regression of that injury.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b32468" class="body-graf"&gt;Moving forward, focus on a healthy diet. Chung recommends the &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/mediterranean-diet-rcna63362"&gt;Mediterranean diet,&lt;/a&gt; which promotes healthy fats, lean protein, antioxidants, whole grains and produce. This diet has been shown to lower the risk of death, lower levels of heart disease and boost digestive health. Chung is a fan because it lessens the accumulation of fat in the liver — a benefit since &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/fatty-liver-diet-rcna140012"&gt;non-alcoholic fatty liver disease&lt;/a&gt; is the leading cause of liver cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-49cb36" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;He also advises fitting as much movement as you can into your day, and drinking alcohol in moderation, especially if you have liver disease, since it can inflame the liver and destroy its cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQcTYwRzJRS3pWRHRkVXZ1cUF1UER6eXJoZHQtMW1UNHhHUHEyQjk2ZUtpeWZ0cWRVOGJWUmNkeWRBcWNGUGdLdXkyc1E1N24yVFFKVlYtMG01Q1JtWUxsVndqLXBfQzJxUVlJZEpXRmxhRHNRX0ktZW9wT1N2OWdjU1hORjBLazZ5eWxUWGRYc2JMUlpQS1M3M21td9IBVEFVX3lxTE9DVXFyU2RFUS0xeHBlZWxRQmdrdXYwTF9LM1Q3VWFUWjdiNVhFQ284MWNZWE5saWpib1V6S2k1LU80aTBtaWh5N0hXcmoxT0VEallhYg</guid></item><item><title>希腊酸奶有多健康？ -《西雅图时报》</title><link>https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/how-healthy-is-greek-yogurt/</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE45UXQ4ZUNVZFNLS1F5SWVjQmxYMGkyNkRhSEFPQzJwbkhyYms1THFENGpST1hxaTRqYkN0VVZ0bjlQRHJrVEtoUzhiVjA0dXlpTFV0Nl8taUNBMnNXMXloUjZpUU11TGNtWmF6ZDNBaVRzN0hnZ1RlVzRB?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;How healthy is Greek yogurt?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 11:22:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE45UXQ4ZUNVZFNLS1F5SWVjQmxYMGkyNkRhSEFPQzJwbkhyYms1THFENGpST1hxaTRqYkN0VVZ0bjlQRHJrVEtoUzhiVjA0dXlpTFV0Nl8taUNBMnNXMXloUjZpUU11TGNtWmF6ZDNBaVRzN0hnZ1RlVzRB</guid></item><item><title>爱情、毒品和安全套：艾滋病毒感染者身份不同的夫妇面临新的现实-美国国家公共广播电台</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/09/11/g-s1-77007/hiv-condoms-hiv-positive-u-s-aid-cuts</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                Robert Ochweda and Millicent Akoth is HIV positive — she caught the virus from her former husband. She is now married to Robert Ochweda, a fisherman who is HIV negative. After the two of them fell in love, he says he was afraid to marry her lest he contract the virus. "I have been able to stay safe by using condoms and PrEP," Ochweda explains, referring to a pill that prevents infection. In the wake of U.S. foreign aid cuts, they say it's become harder to find the pills and condoms that keep them safe.

   &lt;p&gt;Let's say you fall in love with someone harboring a deadly -- and highly infectious -- virus. And you think … is it crazy to get married?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sometimes love conquers all — with the help of modern medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's the story of serodiscordant couples — the term used when one partner is HIV positive and the other is HIV negative.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Robert Ochweda and Millicent Akoth of Kenya are one such couple. She is HIV positive — she caught the virus from her former husband. He is a fisherman who is HIV negative. After the two of them fell in love, he says he was afraid to marry her lest he contract the virus.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;He was able to overcome his fears.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I have been able to stay safe by using condoms and PrEP," Ochweda explains, referring to a pill that prevents infection. And The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention writes: "Most condoms are highly effective in preventing HIV."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;His wife takes antiretroviral pills that reduce her viral load, so she does not face the risk of death from AIDS. Those pills also reduce the risk that she will infect her husband.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This year, couples in this category are especially anxious. They say that, in the wake of the Trump administration's dramatic foreign aid cuts and dismantling of USAID, the agency that supported health-related programs, it's become harder to find the pills and condoms that keep them safe.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-82272" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Caleb Ochieng, who is HIV negative, has been married to DIana Odhiambo, who is HIV positive, for eight years. They have two children. On a recent visit to pick up his PrEP drugs that reduce his risk of infection, he says, "I was told the supply that was available has been reserved for pregnant women."

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Caleb Ochieng, who is HIV negative, has been married to Diana Odhiambo, who is HIV positive, for eight years. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ochieng learned of Odhiambo's HIV status when they went to do an HIV test as they made plans to tie the knot after several years of cohabiting. She believes she contracted the disease from a previous relationship.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We were shocked because at that time we had two children and wanted others. We were advised on preventive measures like condom use and voluntary male circumcision as a way of preventing HIV infection," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I wondered how we would manage," he recalls. "It's not been easy but with love, we have been taking care of ourselves." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Odhiambo takes pills to suppress the virus; he takes pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to stay safe. He is tested for HIV every three months. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Taking these precautions, the couple has had two children who are HIV negative. After counseling, Odhiambo has become a peer educator who talks to other couples in the same situation.  The partner who is positive, he reflects, "has a lot of emotions. AS a partner, you should be there for them and support them well."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On a recent visit to the clinic where he picks up his PrEP drugs, he says, "I was told the supply that was available has been reserved for pregnant women. I traveled to neighboring Busia county and managed to get a small dose that could last a month and a half."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;His experience echoes a memo from the State Department that NPR obtained, stating that if a clinic receives funding through the U.S. program PEPFAR, this preventative medication can "only" be given to "pregnant and breastfeeding women" during the 90-day freeze on foreign aid that the Trump administration instituted — and that is still in effect.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A senior health official with the Kenyan Ministry of Health told NPR that clinics have been rationing medications and other supplies because of the uncertainties about donor funds.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We acquire most of the HIV medication through partners and donors. The exit of U.S. funding means that there is a gap, and until that gap is filled, there is always bound to be friction but the government has done everything to keep operations going," says the official, who asked not to be identified by name because he did not have permission to speak to the press.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Joywine Adek, a programs officer at &lt;a href="https://www.mildmay.org/kenya" target="_blank"&gt;Mildmay Kenya&lt;/a&gt;, an organization that supports HIV patients, is seeing this gap.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mildmay Kenya is among the organizations that was receiving funding from the U.S. government to support HIV interventions in Kenya, including screening services, distribution of antiretroviral drugs and condoms, and counseling for serodiscordant couples.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"In the current grant that is available after the reduction in funding, there is no support for discordant couples," Adek says, adding that the charity has had to halt many of its services because of the loss of U.S. aid.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We are trying to sort this out by doing what we call integration of HIV care into routine health care," says Fredrick Oluoch, the director of public health in Kenya's Kisumu County.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The lack of condoms is evident. This reporter saw empty dispensers where co Kndoms were once stocked and made available in clinics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-82267" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Empty condom dispensers at a charity called Mildmay Kenya, which supports people who are HIV positive. According to the United Nations Population Fund, the U.S. cuts in foreign aid have had an impact on the supply of free condoms for those in need.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;And even though condoms are inexpensive — as little as $1 or $2 each in the U.S., even less in Kenya — that price could still be daunting in a country where a third of the population lives below the poverty line of about $2 a day in income.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kenya has previously reported that the supply of condoms was not equal to the demand. But this year, officials say, things are worse than ever in the wake of the U.S. foreign aid shakeup, which has affected some of the suppliers, like the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a statement to NPR, UNFPA noted: "Kenya has historically relied heavily on USAID for its free condom distribution programs. Kenya's annual condom requirement is estimated at 400–450 million units. Condom procurement by UNFPA has been affected indirectly — but nonetheless significantly - by U.S. funding cuts. While UNFPA continues its role in condom programming through funding from other global partners, the U.S. stop work order has contributed to shortfalls in supply, putting more pressure on UNFPA and other providers. Some 9.8 million UNFPA-procured condoms were received at the Kenya Central Stores on August 13, 2025, but funding restrictions from the U.S. and other donors mean there is uncertainty as to whether UNFPA will be able to meet projected condom procurement needs for 2026 and beyond."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;NPR asked the State Department to respond to these points about U.S. funding and free condom programs but did not receive a response.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The result of this altered aid landscape is that partners with different HIV status are living with newfound uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-82273" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                "The shortage of the drugs and condoms is a major concern for us, and the government is yet to address our concerns," says Erastus Ng'uono, who is HIV positive and married to Winnie Auma Miyare, who is HIV negative. The couple is standing in front of their home with two of their children, a boy named Rain and a baby girl named Rose. Says Ng'uono: "I don't know what the future holds."

   &lt;p&gt;Erastus Ng'uono was born with HIV positive status. When he met Winnie Auma Miyare and wanted to start a relationship with her, he asked her if she could love someone who is HIV positive and using ARVs. A few days later, he told her about his HIV status. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At first she did not want to have anything to do with him. But when he explained how medications could help her ward off infection, she changed her mind. She takes PrEP pills. They have four children who are all HIV negative. Their youngest is six months old. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The news of U.S. aid cuts that could affect the strategies they use has hit them hard. "I encouraged him to have courage and not to worry," she says. "I know the government will intervene." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I was very afraid," he says. "I even prayed over it and I know God will see us through."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still he worries. "The shortage of the drugs and condoms is a major concern for us and the government is yet to address our concerns," says Ng'uono.

He had heard some people were getting prescriptions for the shots, but when he called his doctor’s office, they wouldn’t even make an appointment for a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;North Carolina is one of several states where pharmacists are requiring prescriptions before administering any shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In some states, pharmacists are prevented by law from administering vaccines that are not recommended by the CDC’s advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP). While doctors have liability protections for Covid vaccines under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (Prep) Act, pharmacists may not if the vaccines are not approved by the advisory committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some insurers might also opt not to cover the shots until they are recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The independent advisers are expected to take up Covid recommendations at the next meeting in mid-September, but that meeting has been embroiled in controversy. Senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana, called for an &lt;a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/rep/newsroom/press/cassidy-calls-for-vaccine-committee-meeting-to-be-postponed-following-cdc-departures" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;indefinite postponement&lt;/a&gt; given the recent upheaval at health agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Shipman said: “It’s incredibly frustrating, because this has significant consequences for public health, and there is no reason in the world for this to be happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It is an entirely manufactured problem that is going to cost people their health and wellbeing and possibly their lives. It is manifestly clear that people who would like the Covid vaccine are not able to access it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Changing the rules to make vaccination easier will depend on the state, said Lindsay Wiley, a professor of law and faculty director of the health law and policy program at UCLA Law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“In several states, governors and health officials are solving the prescription problem pretty swiftly, so it’s a rapidly evolving situation right now. In other states, the legislature may need to take action to fix the problem,” Wiley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Even states that have tried to combat the confusion still have vaccine challenges. The state of Maryland released &lt;a href="https://governor.maryland.gov/news/press/pages/Maryland-Protects-Access-to-Vaccines-for-All-Marylanders.aspx" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt; last week for all residents to access vaccines – without specifying the need to disclose qualifying conditions. Maryland’s governor, Wes Moore, called the federal changes to vaccine policy “harmful for Marylanders and all Americans”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet when Ian Morgan tried to obtain the vaccine in Maryland, the pharmacist said it could only be administered to those over the age of 65 or people with at least one underlying health condition. Morgan tried to make an appointment online, but was told CVS couldn’t schedule his appointment because he did not qualify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Morgan, a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institutes of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and a union steward of NIH Fellows United-UAW 2750, said the tumult has been caused by Kennedy’s messaging on vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I think the chaos is the point, and that chaos has consequences,” Morgan said. “Creating this confusion, creating this chaos, trying to discredit scientific experts – and we see that every time [Kennedy] goes out there – that in and of itself is causing problems, and that in itself is harming the American people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f1f7cf35-b4f9-47ab-aad7-e55e9cb97247" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Workers log a shipment of Covid vaccines in Horsham, Pennsylvania.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Matt Rourke/AP&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Morgan is one of 1,000 current and former HHS employees who signed a &lt;a href="https://www.savehhs.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; calling for Kennedy’s resignation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Vaccine availability for children, especially for those under the age of five, has lagged even further behind adults as pediatricians struggle to understand new limitations and potential legal risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Joanne Hilden, a retired physician, has been searching for the updated vaccines for her four grandchildren, who are between the ages three and 12, in Minnesota.

Pharmacies have not received the pediatric doses yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There are also immense structural barriers that make it harder for marginalized people to access the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Julia Lynch, a professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania, first made plans to get vaccinated in Oakland, New Jersey, a 45-minute drive from her home in Philadelphia, before the state board of pharmacy gave pharmacies the go-ahead to vaccinate Pennsylvanians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CVS pharmacies near her home had no appointments, so she ended up driving to a predominantly white suburb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I don’t know why it is that the vaccines are getting to those CVSes first,” she said. But that means “if you’re Black or Latino, you are less likely than if you’re white to live close to someplace where you can get a vaccine”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-27" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-rsfwa"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;This Week in Trumpland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"the-stakes-us-election-edition","successDescription":"A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Traveling to Oakland by public transit would have taken more than two hours on three buses and one regional train.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Eligibility right now is obviously limited to people who are over 65 or who have at least one medical condition that puts them at high risk,” Lynch said. “These are exactly the people who are most likely to have trouble traveling four-plus hours on a multimodal public transit journey to get their Covid shot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Not everyone has reliable internet access, the technological knowledge to book appointments, or the ability to take time off work or find childcare to locate and travel to appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“For people who are not chronically online, it’s a major undertaking to do all this,” Lynch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Fighting to have the shots covered by insurance, or paying out of pocket for the uninsured, is another major hurdle, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Rachel, who lives in Pittsburgh and asked to be identified by her first name to protect her health history, has two autoimmune disorders and a genetic blood clotting disorder that puts her at high risk if she gets sick with Covid. She said she would like to get the latest Covid shot, but is planning to wait for a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The challenges right now for me are just around information, and actually knowing what is the truth and what is going to happen if I try to get it,” she said. She said she had heard of people being turned away from pharmacies even after the Pennsylvania vaccine announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It just sounds like it’s still a shitshow. It’s still challenging to make an appointment here, so I’m going to wait a little bit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Rachel said it reminded her of 2021, when many people scrambled to get their first Covid shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s just frustrating to me that based on absolutely zero evidence, and in some cases, just making up lies about evidence, [the] HHS has just decided these are so dangerous that we need to limit them,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sarah, who lives in Westchester county, New York, and asked to be identified by her first name so she is not harassed by anti-vaccine activists, said she was finally able to get the shot after days of effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In New York, she needed a prescription. That later changed when Kathy Hochul, the governor, &lt;a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-signs-executive-order-expanding-access-vaccines-amid-uncertainty-washington" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;opened&lt;/a&gt; up access to all New Yorkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The faxed prescription never went through, so her health system had to set up an electronic prescription system. Sarah asked that her doctor prescribe any Covid vaccine; she said she overheard the pharmacist denying one prescription because it was for the Pfizer vaccine and they only had Moderna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Even after the prescription was received, the pharmacist said he needed verbal confirmation from the doctor by phone as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sarah said she paid $250 out of pocket, and has since spent hours on the phone with her insurance company to be reimbursed. After she paid, the pharmacist tried to dissuade her from getting the shot, Sarah said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Do you really know what you’re getting into? This is brand new,” she recalls him saying. She responded: “I know – that’s why I want it.” But he told her they “don’t know anything” about the updated vaccines and “we don’t know what’s gonna happen” to her once she received it, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The roadblocks were “wearing me down”, Sarah said. “It’s trying to make it inaccessible, impossible, confusing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Shipman in North Carolina was dogged in his search, even looking at appointments in other states. Eventually, he was able to receive the vaccine at an urgent care center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But not everyone is able to track down the vaccine and overcome these obstacles, Lynch said. “It’s really hard for ordinary people who are very busy and not necessarily paying close attention to this to know what they’re supposed to do to keep themselves or their loved ones safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 10:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE5aenlhSG9hSV8zOW5oSWpzUmdXZW9xeGxnRWowV0dieGRicEY0NXhfMk01aEdfSUxqLXVqTUtrXzh1Y2hRWmlEbUs2a2lKaGpVRGJVSDdRTXZQY2JPYlRjcEdkSTlPdnJVVDlwa01fM09URGRhQlRna0NnaDc</guid></item><item><title>Dropping hepatitis B shots for newborns would ignore history and endanger children, scientists warn - statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/11/newborn-hep-b-vaccine-debate-how-it-started/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the late 1980s and the American plan to combat hepatitis B wasn’t working. A vaccine had been available since 1982 and recommended for those deemed to be at highest risk, such as health care workers and men who have sex with men. But the infection rates had gone up, not down. When epidemiologists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dug into the data, they noticed one figure that had stayed alarmingly stable: Between 30% and 40% of hepatitis B patients had no identifiable risk factors at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When they published &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/380888" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;their paper&lt;/a&gt; in 1990, it was subtitled, “Need for Alternative Vaccination Strategies.” The next year, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices — the CDC body that sets such guidelines — recommended vaccinating all infants. Over the next two decades, case numbers &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00333549231175548" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;plummeted&lt;/a&gt; by 99% among children and teens. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, under the Trump administration, some members of the ACIP have hinted at a desire to reverse course when the committee &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;next&lt;/a&gt; convenes on Sept. 18 and 19, as part of a broader review of childhood vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the last meeting in June, after health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. abruptly &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/09/rfk-jr-fires-every-member-of-cdc-vaccine-expert-panel-acip/"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; all 17 experts who sat on the committee and &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/11/rfk-jr-names-new-acip-members-replaces-cdc-vaccine-experts-he-just-fired/"&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; them with his own picks, the new chair, Martin Kulldorff, expressed doubts about the current advice. “Is it wise to administer a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine to every newborn before leaving the hospital? That’s the question,” he said. “Unless the mother is hepatitis B positive, an argument could be made to delay the vaccine for this infection, which is primarily spread by sexual activity and intravenous drug use.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To people who study, treat, or have hepatitis B, that argument is dangerously misguided, and if adopted, they warn it could lead to a resurgence of the virus as well as the liver disease and cancer it causes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m speechless. It’s a failure to recognize why that strategy was put into place,” said Miriam Alter, the first author of that 1990 study, now retired from the CDC and the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. If that argument is taken up by the committee, she went on, “the virus, because it still circulates in the population, will rear its ugly head. We’ll be back in the same situation we were in when we depended upon risk-factor-based screening.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;One reason for giving the first vaccine dose on the first day of life, and the next doses soon after, is that infants are exquisitely vulnerable. A newly minted immune system — still learning what’s foreign and what’s self, not yet able to muster certain protective white blood cells — can allow hepatitis B to run amok, replicating continuously. That &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/12/4/439" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;happens&lt;/a&gt; to fewer than 10% of people who get infected as adults, to 30% of those who get infected between the ages of 1 and 4, and to a whopping 90% of babies who get infected in the first year. If they’re vaccinated, though, that rate nosedives into the single digits. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What you need to do is get their bodies the tools they need for the babies to start fighting the virus as soon as they are exposed,” said Chari Cohen, president of the Hepatitis B Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That exposure can take place before an infant has fully entered the world. Hepatitis B is a blood-borne pathogen, and childbirth, be it vaginal or cesarean, is bloody, with a possibility of mother-to-child transmission. While Sen. Rand Paul (R.-Ky.) &lt;a href="https://x.com/RandPaul/status/1962223758896173407" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recently claimed on X&lt;/a&gt; that there is “no medical need to give newborns Hep B vaccine if mother is not infected” because “all mothers who deliver in a hospital are tested,” he was quickly corrected by his Senate colleague Bill Cassidy (R.-La.), who &lt;a href="https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/1962269409642197050" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;posted, “Empirically, this is not true.&lt;/a&gt; Not all mothers have prenatal care. Some get infected between testing in the first trimester and delivery. In some cases, the test is overlooked.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If infection occurs at birth, there’s a 24-hour window of opportunity. “The vaccine needs to be given immediately to help the newborn develop antibodies to fight off that infection they have just been exposed to,” said John Ward, director of the Coalition for Global Hepatitis Elimination, who led the CDC’s viral hepatitis division from 2005 to 2018. “The longer you wait, then the longer that virus has time to set up shop and resist those antibodies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But early immunization isn’t only helpful in cases of maternal infection. Hepatitis B is extremely infectious, some 50-to-100 times more easily transmissible than HIV, with more of it typically present in blood, meaning that a smaller speck may suffice for the pathogen to be passed on. Su Wang, a New Jersey physician specializing in hepatitis B, has seen young people with so much virus per milliliter of blood that “the lab test couldn’t even quantify it,” and technicians had to dilute the specimen in order to get a read. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means that a child’s risk doesn’t end once they come home from the hospital: Transmission can happen in the household or at day care, in the infinitesimal-seeming blood exposure that might stem from a razor nick or shared toothbrush, a bite or scratch from another kid. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Wang is a case in point. She was diagnosed with hepatitis B in her first year of college, when she signed up to donate blood, and she assumed she’d gotten it from her mom. But when her mom got tested, it came back negative. Her maternal grandparents, on the other hand, tested positive. They’d lived with Wang’s family when she was little, and Wang imagines that they may have been her source of exposure, but can’t be sure. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those cases of early-childhood transmission are rare in the United States, but the consequences can be dire. Often, the virus lurks silently in the liver. It triggers inflammation that kills cells, which means someone may end up needing a transplant. But it also hijacks the genetic machinery and increases the likelihood of mutations. “We hear these stories all the time. Someone wakes up with tremendous pain in their side, they go to the emergency room, and by the end of the day, they’re told they have liver cancer,” Cohen said. “They don’t find out they have hep B until after they’re diagnosed with liver cancer, and they live for six weeks.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such horrible outcomes are part of the calculus behind a “birth dose.” While critics of the strategy point out that some countries such as Denmark don’t vaccinate against hepatitis B until later in infancy, American researchers respond that the setting is quite different: Unlike European countries with smaller populations and universal health care systems, the United States has no unified public health apparatus that tracks every baby born and every intervention they receive. Prenatal care falls through the cracks; childhood visits fall through the cracks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other issues emerge when trying to screen or vaccinate adults based on their risk, as was recommended in the 1980s. If patients get to the doctor’s office at all, doctors may not think to ask about risk factors. Even if they do, patients might not feel comfortable disclosing their histories of sexual encounters and drug use, for instance, given the potential for stigma. Plus, by then, it might be too late.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“How do you identify individuals before they become ‘at risk’? You can’t,” said Alter. “That’s why immunizing young children was such a successful strategy. Because, by doing that, you immunize the population before they develop risk factors, whatever those risk factors might be.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Plus, hundreds of millions of people have received the hepatitis B vaccine worldwide, and follow-up studies have shown that it is remarkably safe, with the most common side effects being fever, redness and soreness at the injection site, and vomiting. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to forget, when discussing statistics and stratifications of risk, that real people’s lives are at stake. There are antivirals that can help control hepatitis B, but there is no cure. Once people have it, they have it for life. If their immune systems become suppressed, it can roar out of hiding. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After she was diagnosed at 21, during a routine screening before a college semester abroad, Wendy Lo sometimes couldn’t bring herself to go to her appointments. She’d likely been infected from her mom at birth; every visit was a painful reminder of the stigma she’d inherited. “Monitoring was doing a number to my psychology,” said Lo, 52, a former tech professional who now works as a fitness coach and hepatitis B advocate. “It’s just telling me I have this blemish. It’s kind of like a scarlet letter, this stain.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She eventually did seek care, but at every stage, the virus shadowed her life. She canceled her study abroad program. The need to disclose her status made dating a minefield. Even the mildest of social drinking was off limits, given her elevated risk of liver failure. When she got married, her husband was protected by vaccines but she was terrified of giving the disease to her children. When doctors reassured her, saying that her babies would be safe with the administration of vaccines and other protective proteins, she worried that she might leave them without a mom. “Premature death, that is a very real and perpetual anxiety,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fear was heightened as her uncle died of liver failure caused by hepatitis B. There were jobs and promotions Lo didn’t accept because she worried the stress might be too much for her health, or because the new health insurance wouldn’t cover the hepatitis drugs she needed. There are all sorts of medications she’s avoided so as not to burden her liver. In her 40s, when she was diagnosed with scarring of the liver, she became so anxious she couldn’t eat or sleep or make even the most quotidian decision. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She’d been born years too early. But she can’t help but splice those two time frames together, and imagine what might’ve happened if she hadn’t gotten the virus, if she’d gone to do that semester abroad in Nanjing, if she’d stayed in China to start her career as planned — all of the worries and complications and curveballs she could have sidestepped with a vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The discovery offers a promising pathway toward targeted therapies using a familiar, already approved drug. Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MiR-93 promotes fatty liver disease, but vitamin B3 can counteract its effects. This discovery suggests a new treatment approach.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly 30% of people worldwide are affected by metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MASLD), a condition that until recently lacked targeted therapies. In an important breakthrough, scientists have identified a genetic factor that worsens the disease, and notably, the FDA-approved compound shown to be most effective against this factor is vitamin B3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A global first was achieved by a collaborative research group led by Professor Jang Hyun Choi of the Department of Life Sciences at UNIST, together with Professor Hwayoung Yun from the College of Pharmacy and Research Institute for Drug Development at Pusan National University (PNU) and Professor Neung Hwa Park from Ulsan University Hospital (UUH). Their work revealed the critical role of microRNA-93 (miR-93), a molecule expressed in the liver, as a genetic regulator influencing the onset and progression of MASLD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Role of miR-93 in liver function&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MiR-93 is a type of &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;RNA&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;RNA, or ribonucleic acid, is a single-stranded molecule involved in coding, decoding, and regulating gene expression. It acts as a messenger between DNA and protein synthesis and plays crucial roles in both genetic function and viral replication. Variants like mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA support different stages of protein assembly.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt; found in hepatocytes that suppresses the activity of specific target genes. Researchers detected unusually high levels of miR-93 in both human patients with fatty liver disease and in experimental animal models. Molecular studies showed that miR-93 drives lipid buildup, inflammation, and fibrosis by blocking the expression of SIRT1, a gene essential for regulating lipid metabolism in liver cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When scientists used gene-editing techniques to block miR-93 production in mice, they observed major reductions in liver fat accumulation, along with improved &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;insulin&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, crucial for regulating blood glucose levels. It helps cells in the body absorb glucose from the bloodstream and convert it into energy or store it for future use. Insulin production and action are essential for maintaining stable blood sugar levels. In people with diabetes, the body either does not produce enough insulin (Type 1 diabetes) or cannot effectively use the insulin it does produce (Type 2 diabetes), leading to elevated levels of glucose in the blood. This can cause various health complications over time, including heart disease, kidney damage, and nerve dysfunction. Insulin therapy, where insulin is administered through injections or an insulin pump, is a common treatment for managing diabetes, particularly Type 1. The discovery of insulin in 1921 by Frederick Banting and Charles Best was a landmark in medical science, transforming diabetes from a fatal disease to a manageable condition.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;insulin&lt;/span&gt; sensitivity and liver function markers. In contrast, mice engineered to overexpress miR-93 displayed more severe impairments in liver metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Vitamin B3 as a therapeutic candidate&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, screening 150 FDA-approved drugs revealed that niacin (vitamin B3) most effectively suppresses miR-93. Mice treated with niacin showed a significant decrease in hepatic miR-93 levels and a notable increase in SIRT1 activity. The activated SIRT1 restored disrupted lipid metabolism pathways, thereby normalizing liver lipid homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team explained, “This study precisely elucidates the molecular origin of MASLD and demonstrates the potential for repurposing an already approved vitamin compound to modulate this pathway, which has high translational clinical relevance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They added, “Given that niacin is a well-established and safe medication used to treat hyperlipidemia, it holds promise as a candidate for combination therapies targeting miRNA pathways in MASLD.”&lt;/p&gt;

(&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADerDrK0Vs/"&gt;selvanegra/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new blood test measures the protein p-tau217, which is considered an effective biomarker of the presence of both the rogue proteins in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the test has already proven effective in finding p-tau217, scientists want to investigate whether administering it when memory issues are first assessed can help diagnosis and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts believe blood tests such as plasma p-tau217 can detect the presence of amyloid and tau as accurately as current –  but more invasive – methods such as PET scans and lumbar punctures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial is part of the Blood Biomarker Challenge, a multimillion-pound research project supported by UK Alzheimer's charities hoping to make breakthroughs in the use of blood tests to diagnose Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Schott, a professor of neurology at UCL's Dementia Research Centre who is co-leading the trial, &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/sep/uk-trial-launches-transform-alzheimers-diagnosis-simple-blood-test"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; he hoped it would "take us a step forward in revolutionizing the way we diagnose dementia".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early diagnosis would become even more important in coming years "as a new generation of treatments emerge that can slow down the decline of memory and thinking," he &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/sep/uk-trial-launches-transform-alzheimers-diagnosis-simple-blood-test"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Timely diagnosis will be key to ensuring these advances reach the people who need them most," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;© &lt;a href="terms-and-conditions"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Research on the microbes living in our digestive tract has triggered a '&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9503711/"&gt;revolution&lt;/a&gt;' in nutritional science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, dietary fiber has become the "&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/inulin-is-being-added-to-many-foods-but-it-could-be-causing-stomach-problems"&gt;new protein&lt;/a&gt;", added to foods &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-create-invisible-fiber-that-can-make-cakes-and-pizzas-better-for-you"&gt;in abundance&lt;/a&gt; to feed our gut's microbiome and boost our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a study on mice published in 2024 suggests that not all fiber supplements are equally beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-fiber-could-protect-you-from-infections-heres-why"&gt;Eating Fiber Could Protect You From Infections. Here's Why.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A form that is readily found in oats and barley, called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oat_beta-glucan"&gt;beta-glucan&lt;/a&gt;, can control blood sugar and assist in weight loss among mice fed a high-fat diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Arizona (UA) and the University of Vienna found it decreased a mouse's fat content and body weight within 18 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other fibers they tested, including wheat dextrin, pectin, resistant starch, and cellulose, had no such effect, despite shifting the makeup of the mouse microbiome significantly compared to mice fed no fiber supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know that fiber is important and beneficial; the problem is that there are so many different types," &lt;a href="https://news.arizona.edu/news/how-your-morning-oats-could-help-you-manage-your-weight"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; biomedical scientist Frank Duca from UA in July last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We wanted to know what kind of fiber would be most beneficial for weight loss and improvements in glucose homeostasis so that we can inform the community, the consumer, and then also inform the agricultural industry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietary fibers are the &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-nutrition-society/article/interactions-between-dietary-fibre-and-the-gut-microbiota/0BEF28B809F38D02AC0B1D4E4990210C"&gt;main source of energy&lt;/a&gt; for bacteria living in our guts, and &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/health-benefits-dietary-fibers-vary"&gt;yet less than 5 percent&lt;/a&gt; of people in the US consume the &lt;a href="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/increasing-fiber-intake"&gt;recommended 25–30 grams (0.9–1 ounce)&lt;/a&gt; of fiber a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_133570" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-133570" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OatsAndABowl.jpg" alt="A bowl of oats and some oat grains " class="size-full wp-image-133570" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OatsAndABowl.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OatsAndABowl-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-133570" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Beta-glucan is found in oats and barley. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADat1fdGi4/"&gt;ArxOnt/Canva Pro&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make up for this, fiber supplements and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-create-invisible-fiber-that-can-make-cakes-and-pizzas-better-for-you"&gt;'invisible fiber'-infused foods&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/inulin-is-being-added-to-many-foods-but-it-could-be-causing-stomach-problems"&gt;growing in popularity&lt;/a&gt;. But fibers are extremely diverse, so which do we choose?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some fibers, like oat beta-glucans and wheat dextrin, are water-&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/compare-dietary-fibers"&gt;soluble&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they are easily fermented by gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others, like cellulose and resistant starch, are less soluble or insoluble, meaning they &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/whats-the-difference-between-soluble-and-insoluble-fiber"&gt;stick to other materials to form stool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjnut.2024.05.003"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; biomedical scientist Elizabeth Howard from UA and her colleagues, "there is no study that has investigated the role of various fibers in one cohort."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make up for this, the current study tested several forms of fiber in one cohort of mice. Only beta-glucan was found to increase the number of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileibacterium"&gt;Ileibacterium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in the mouse intestine. Other &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/nxy011"&gt;studies on mice&lt;/a&gt; have linked this bacterium to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, long before the 10-week marker, mice fed beta-glucan showed reduced body weight and body fat content compared to mice fed other forms of fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings align with another recent &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12986-023-00767-8"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Duca, which fed barley flour, rich in beta-glucan, to rodents. Even though the rats continued eating just as much of their high-fat diet as before, their energy expenditure increased and they lost weight anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar outcome was observed in mice fed beta-glucan in the new study. These animals also showed increased concentrations of butyrate in their guts, which is a metabolite made when microbes break down fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Butyrate induces the release of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which is the natural protein that synthetic drugs like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-ozempic-and-why-are-people-saying-its-a-sad-way-to-lose-weight"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; mimic to stimulate insulin release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_124692" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-124692" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/FingersHoldOzempicPen-642x260.jpg" alt="Fingers Hold Ozempic Pen" class="size-medium wp-image-124692" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/FingersHoldOzempicPen-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/FingersHoldOzempicPen-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/FingersHoldOzempicPen-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/FingersHoldOzempicPen.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-124692" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Ozempic and other semaglutide drugs mimic the effects of GLP-1. (imyskin/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Part of the benefits of consuming dietary fiber is through the release of GLP-1 and other gut peptides that regulate appetite and body weight," &lt;a href="https://news.arizona.edu/news/how-your-morning-oats-could-help-you-manage-your-weight"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Duca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, we don't think that's all of the effect. We think that there are other beneficial things that butyrate could be doing that are not gut peptide related, such as improving gut barrier health and targeting peripheral organs like the liver."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far more research is needed before these results can be extended to humans, but the findings suggest that some fibers may be better suited to weight loss and insulin control than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjnut.2024.05.003"&gt;Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in July 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;COVID-19 is no longer one of the top 10 causes of death in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Early data on deaths in 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr039.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;published by&lt;/a&gt; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, show that COVID dropped from the list for the first time since the start of the pandemic. It became the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db456.htm" target="_blank"&gt;third leading cause of death&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. in 2020, and remained among the leading causes until now.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"COVID is still in the top 15 leading causes of death, so it hasn't disappeared," says Farida Ahmad, a health scientist at the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics and lead author on the publication.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Since its &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db456.htm" target="_blank"&gt;peak in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, when more than 463,000 people died from COVID, it has been moving steadily down the list. Last year, it was a factor in around &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;47,000&lt;/a&gt; U.S. deaths.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Overall, deaths last year were down 4% from the previous year, and it was the third consecutive year of that downward trend, Ahmad says. The declines extend across the board, to most age groups and to people of all races and ethnicities, and can be attributed to a number of factors, such as fewer deaths from COVID and from drug overdoses, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The leading causes of death included suicide, diabetes, kidney disease, and unintentional injury. Heart disease and cancer — both chronic diseases — remained the top two leading causes of death, as they have been for more than a decade, and were responsible for more than 40% of U.S. deaths in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Death rates were higher for men than women, for older adults, and for Black Americans compared with other racial and ethnic groups.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The fact that we're seeing people living into older and older age and dying of chronic diseases is a sign that we've been successful at dealing with infectious diseases," says Kathleen Ethier, a former CDC official at the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion&lt;/a&gt;, who left the agency in January and was not involved in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Tackling chronic diseases takes a different strategy, Ethier says: "These are things that develop over time, that are highly impacted by our behavior and environments and genetics."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;With heart disease, for instance, a person may have higher risks if they have a family history of the condition, if they live in &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.123.323613" target="_blank"&gt;stressful or polluted environments&lt;/a&gt;, if they mainly eat &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/05/25/1178163270/ultra-processed-foods-health-risk-weight-gain" target="_blank"&gt;ultraprocessed foods&lt;/a&gt;, and if they have spotty access to health care. "What kinds of food can people afford? Do they have insurance and money to pay for services? Those are difficult, entrenched things for public health to impact," Ethier says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. released a report titled "Make Our Children Healthy Again," which &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/09/nx-s1-5534412/rfk-maha-report-childrens-health" target="_blank"&gt;drew mixed reviews&lt;/a&gt; from public health advocates, who note that its goals clash with other recent moves by the Trump Administration, including cuts to food assistance, scientific research, Medicaid programs and changes that limit access to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What this administration is doing is going to make the top ten causes of death worse," says Ethier. She notes that President Trump's &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;FY 2026 budget&lt;/a&gt; targets the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC division&lt;/a&gt; that's focused on preventing chronic diseases for elimination in. This includes the &lt;a href="https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/press-releases/2025_05_05_administrations-budget-would-devastate-cdc-efforts-to-fight-chronic-disease-and-tobacco-use" target="_blank"&gt;office that deals with smoking&lt;/a&gt;, a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke and some cancers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            Among all high-income Western countries, the United States has shown the worst performance in reducing the probability of dying from chronic diseases, a new study finds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvyce00043b6ngt3q0w0d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            From 2010 to 2019, deaths due to chronic diseases declined in most age groups in the US but increased among adults 20 to 45, “a rare phenomenon in high-income western countries,” according to the study, published Wednesday in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01388-1/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The study, led by researchers at Imperial College London, analyzed data on 185 countries and territories and found that, from 2010 to 2019, the probability of dying by age 80 from a noncommunicable disease — such as cancer, heart disease and stroke — declined in most of those countries, but the decline&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;had slowed compared with&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the previous decade.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvyce00063b6nild6cgho@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The risk of dying – or what we call probability in the paper – from chronic diseases in most countries in the world is coming down,” said Majid Ezzati, the study’s senior author and a professor in the School of Public Health at Imperial College London and Imperial Global Ghana.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvyce00073b6necpuru5j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But we were doing better before,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvyce00083b6nz5rda8n1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among the 25 high-income Western countries in the study, Denmark had the largest decline in chronic disease deaths, while the United States had the smallest, and Germany did only slightly better than the United States.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvyce00093b6nqn9mrc75@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The US is the slowest, but it’s by no means the exception,” Ezzati said. “Germany is doing nearly as badly.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000a3b6nuznk8at0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among the high-income Western countries, there were small to moderate declines in the probability of dying from a chronic disease by age 80 from 2010 to 2019&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;overall. But the researchers noted that a possible reason why the declines were not larger as a group is that in many countries, neuropsychiatric conditions such as dementia increased and contributed unfavorably to the trends.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000b3b6nt75iqwnh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new study included data from the World Health Organization’s &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/data/global-health-estimates" target="_blank"&gt;Global Health Estimates&lt;/a&gt;, and the team of researchers analyzed deaths between time periods, countries and by age groups: young adults 20 to 45, working-age adults 45 to 65, and older adults 65 to 80.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000c3b6n7sccev1z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The data showed that from 2010 to 2019, chronic disease deaths declined in about 80% of the world’s countries, home to more than 70% of the global population.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000d3b6nazce3hrr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The reasons for widespread decline in chronic disease mortality could be tied to improvements in diagnosing and treating chronic diseases, according to the study. For instance, there have been changes in clinical guidelines as well as increases in the use of certain medications and the early detection of certain cancers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000e3b6nchlfuy6c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But in about 60% of countries, either the decline in chronic disease deaths from 2010 to 2019 was smaller than it had been in the preceding decade or there was a reversal of an earlier decline, the data showed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000f3b6nzrshd1ia@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The countries that did really well did well both in older and working ages. Countries that did really badly did badly in both older and working ages,” Ezzati said. “And then there was some tradeoff between these. Some places never slowed down in older ages, but they have in working ages, and vice versa.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000g3b6ndumo1prx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            From 2010 to 2019, Finland, Norway and Denmark all had a slower decline in chronic disease deaths among older ages than they had in the previous decade. But they still maintained significant progress in reducing the risk of chronic disease deaths overall because that slower decline among older adults was countered by faster declines among working-age adults.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000h3b6n2nyupit9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the United States, small reductions in mortality among older adults were combined with a stagnation among working-age adults and increases in mortality among young adults, leading to the nation’s poor performance compared with other high-income Western countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000i3b6nndxkmozs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study did not analyze why some countries had greater improvements than others in reducing the probability of chronic disease deaths, but Ezzati had some ideas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000j3b6nxtz69a9w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In both high-income Western countries that performed poorly compared with their peers – the United States and Germany – there are segments of the population in which there has been less investment in public health, he noted, and these disparities in investment can lead to broad barriers to accessing care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000k3b6nw55t9kn7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For instance, a barrier can be not having a primary care physician in your local area, which can lead to the delayed screening for and diagnosis of chronic conditions, Ezzati said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000l3b6nnw91guzz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many Americans live in areas where critical-care services are lacking. It’s estimated that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/03/health/hospital-deserts"&gt;nearly 30 million Americans don’t live within an hour of trauma care&lt;/a&gt;. And a CNN analysis has found that people living in 16% of the mainland United States are 30 miles or more from the nearest hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000m3b6n5o94sfdp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The United States also has had a rise in the probability of dying from neuropsychiatric conditions, such as dementia and alcohol use disorders, which did not appear to offset continued declines in deaths from cancers and cardiovascular diseases – and these trends could have contributed to the nation’s poor performance in reducing chronic disease mortality, according to the researchers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000p3b6nr7214aud@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new study was published a day after the Trump administration released the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/09/health/make-america-healthy-again-maha-report"&gt;Make America Healthy Again Commission&lt;/a&gt;’s action plan on reducing &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/maha-commission-report-childhood-disease-strategy.html" target="_blank"&gt;childhood chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt; in the United States.

            US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has made tackling chronic diseases a primary focus. In an &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/bretbaier/reel/DOZjGEPj3c3/" target="_blank"&gt;interview Tuesday on Fox News&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy noted that the share of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2025/24_0539.htm" target="_blank"&gt;US adults with at least one chronic condition is 76.4%&lt;/a&gt;, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000s3b6nxakxnxm9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Elena Ladas, a professor of global integrative medicine at Columbia University and an expert on noncommunicable diseases in young people, said she is optimistic the United States is heading toward embracing wellness as a prevention tool to reduce chronic disease deaths, but she wants to see a clear implementation plan.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000t3b6n69djci5b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’re talking about the right things: Ultraprocessed foods need to really be minimized, and exposures to pesticides and environmental contaminants,” Ladas said of the MAHA report. “They’re talking about what I think a lot of epidemiologists and clinicians have been saying for a very long time. But how they’re going to implement that remains to be seen.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000u3b6nta4i7ft8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ladas, who was not involved in the new study but has done public health work in nearly two dozen countries, said the United States should “think about wellness comprehensively” to reduce the burden of chronic disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000v3b6n9brmur57@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Wellness approaches include good nutrition. We need to make healthy food reasonably priced. A lot of times, farmer’s markets are more expensive than the grocery store. You don’t see that in Europe. In Europe, farmer’s markets are far less expensive than grocery stores,” Ladas said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfebvycf000w3b6nxyp4yfic@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And mental health can include meditation and deep-breathing,” she added. “There are more holistic wellness approaches to include for a lot of these chronic conditions versus being only medication-based resolutions. You need both.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USF and FAU researchers identify bacterium behind 1,500-year-old pandemic mystery.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time, scientists have obtained direct genomic evidence of the bacterium responsible for the Plague of Justinian, the earliest known pandemic in recorded history. The outbreak, which struck the Eastern Mediterranean nearly 1,500 years ago, has now been firmly tied to &lt;em&gt;Yersinia pestis&lt;/em&gt;, the pathogen that causes plague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An international team led by researchers at the University of South Florida and Florida Atlantic University, working with partners in India and Australia, identified &lt;em&gt;Y. pestis&lt;/em&gt; in human remains from a mass grave at the ancient city of Jerash in Jordan, close to the heart of the pandemic. This pivotal discovery confirms the bacterium’s role in the Justinian Plague (AD 541–750), resolving a mystery that has lingered for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_493351" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-493351" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rays-Jiang-1-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-493351" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rays-Jiang-1-777x519.jpg" alt="Rays Jiang" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rays-Jiang-1-777x519.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rays-Jiang-1-400x267.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rays-Jiang-1-768x513.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rays-Jiang-1-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rays-Jiang-1-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rays-Jiang-1-150x100.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rays-Jiang-1-450x300.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Rays-Jiang-1-1200x801.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-493351" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Rays Jiang, PhD, University of South Florida.

&lt;h4&gt;Filling historical gaps with genetic proof&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For hundreds of years, scholars debated the origins of the catastrophic outbreak that killed tens of millions, reshaped the Byzantine Empire, and altered the trajectory of Western history. Although written accounts hinted at plague, no biological proof had been available, leaving a critical gap in the narrative of pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, two newly released papers led by USF and FAU provide that missing proof, offering fresh insight into one of humanity’s most transformative health crises. The findings also highlight plague’s continued presence today: although uncommon, &lt;em&gt;Y. pestis&lt;/em&gt; still circulates globally. In July, a resident of northern Arizona died from pneumonic plague, the deadliest form of the disease and the first U.S. fatality since 2007, followed just a week later by a confirmed case in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_493348" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-493348" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/USF-Researcher-Holding-Excavated-Human-Tooth-With-Roots-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-493348" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/USF-Researcher-Holding-Excavated-Human-Tooth-With-Roots-777x378.jpg" alt="USF Researcher Holding Excavated Human Tooth With Roots" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/USF-Researcher-Holding-Excavated-Human-Tooth-With-Roots-777x378.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/USF-Researcher-Holding-Excavated-Human-Tooth-With-Roots-400x194.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/USF-Researcher-Holding-Excavated-Human-Tooth-With-Roots-768x373.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/USF-Researcher-Holding-Excavated-Human-Tooth-With-Roots-1536x747.jpg 1536w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/USF-Researcher-Holding-Excavated-Human-Tooth-With-Roots-2048x996.jpg 2048w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/USF-Researcher-Holding-Excavated-Human-Tooth-With-Roots-150x73.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/USF-Researcher-Holding-Excavated-Human-Tooth-With-Roots-450x219.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/USF-Researcher-Holding-Excavated-Human-Tooth-With-Roots-1200x583.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-493348" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Tooth from the Jerash architectural site.

&lt;p&gt;“This discovery provides the long-sought definitive proof of &lt;em&gt;Y. pestis&lt;/em&gt; at the epicenter of the Plague of Justinian,” said Rays H. Y. Jiang, PhD, lead PI of the studies and associate professor with the USF College of Public Health. “For centuries, we’ve relied on written accounts describing a devastating disease, but lacked any hard biological evidence of plague’s presence. Our findings provide the missing piece of that puzzle, offering the first direct genetic window into how this pandemic unfolded at the heart of the empire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Evidence of widespread mortality&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Plague of Justinian was first documented in Pelusium (modern-day Tell el-Farama) in Egypt, before sweeping across the Eastern Roman, or Byzantine, Empire. Although remnants of &lt;em&gt;Y. pestis&lt;/em&gt; had been detected in small villages in western Europe thousands of miles away, no genetic evidence had ever been uncovered within the empire itself or close to the pandemic’s center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Using targeted ancient &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;DNA&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a molecule made of two long strands of nucleotides twisted into a double helix. It serves as the hereditary material in humans and nearly all other organisms, encoding the genetic instructions used for development, functioning, and reproduction. Most DNA resides in the cell nucleus (nuclear DNA), while a smaller portion is found in mitochondria (mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; techniques, we successfully recovered and sequenced genetic material from eight human teeth excavated from burial chambers beneath the former Roman hippodrome in Jerash, a city just 200 miles from ancient Pelusium,” said Greg O’Corry-Crowe, PhD, co-author and a research professor at FAU Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute and a National Geographic Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_493347" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-493347" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/The-Ancient-DNA-Lab-at-Florida-Atlantic-University.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-493347" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/The-Ancient-DNA-Lab-at-Florida-Atlantic-University.jpg" alt="The Ancient DNA Lab at Florida Atlantic University" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/The-Ancient-DNA-Lab-at-Florida-Atlantic-University.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/The-Ancient-DNA-Lab-at-Florida-Atlantic-University-400x240.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/The-Ancient-DNA-Lab-at-Florida-Atlantic-University-768x461.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/The-Ancient-DNA-Lab-at-Florida-Atlantic-University-150x90.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/The-Ancient-DNA-Lab-at-Florida-Atlantic-University-450x270.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-493347" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The Ancient DNA lab at Florida Atlantic University. Credit: FAU&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arena had been repurposed as a mass grave during the mid-sixth to early seventh century, when written accounts describe a sudden wave of mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genomic analysis revealed that the plague victims carried nearly identical strains of &lt;em&gt;Y. pestis&lt;/em&gt;, confirming for the first time that the bacterium was present within the Byzantine Empire between AD 550-660. That genetic uniformity suggests a rapid, devastating outbreak consistent with historical descriptions of a plague causing mass death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Jerash site offers a rare glimpse of how ancient societies responded to public health disasters,” said Jiang. “Jerash was one of the key cities of the Eastern Roman Empire, a documented trade hub with magnificent structures. That a venue once built for entertainment and civic pride became a mass cemetery in a time of emergency shows how urban centers were very likely overwhelmed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Broader evolutionary patterns&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/14/8/797"&gt;companion study&lt;/a&gt;, also led by USF and FAU, places the Jerash discovery into a wider evolutionary context. By analyzing hundreds of ancient and modern &lt;em&gt;Y. pestis &lt;/em&gt;genomes — including those newly recovered from Jerash — the researchers showed that the bacteria had been circulating among human populations for millennia before the Justinian outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also found that later plague pandemics, from the Black Death of the 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century to cases still appearing today, did not descend from a single ancestral strain. Instead, they arose independently and repeatedly from longstanding animal reservoirs, erupting in multiple waves across different regions and eras. This repeated pattern stands in stark contrast to the &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;SARS-CoV-2&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, first identified in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily spreads through respiratory droplets and has infected hundreds of millions worldwide.

&lt;figure id="attachment_493350" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-493350" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Greg-OCorry-Crowe.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-493350" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Greg-OCorry-Crowe-777x1021.jpg" alt="Greg O’Corry Crowe" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Greg-OCorry-Crowe-777x1021.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Greg-OCorry-Crowe-400x525.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Greg-OCorry-Crowe-768x1009.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Greg-OCorry-Crowe-1169x1536.jpg 1169w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Greg-OCorry-Crowe-150x197.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Greg-OCorry-Crowe-450x591.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Greg-OCorry-Crowe-1200x1576.jpg 1200w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Greg-OCorry-Crowe.jpg 1559w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-493350" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Greg O’Corry-Crowe, PhD, Florida Atlantic University.

&lt;p&gt;Together, the landmark findings reshape the understanding of how pandemics emerge, recur and spread, and why they remain a persistent feature of human civilization. The research underscores that pandemics are not singular historical catastrophes, but repeating biological events driven by human congregation, mobility and environmental change — themes that remain relevant today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Shared humanity across pandemics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This research was both scientifically compelling and personally resonant. It offered an extraordinary opportunity to delve into the study of human history through the lens of ancient DNA at a time when we ourselves were living through a global pandemic,” said O’Corry-Crowe. “Equally profound was the experience of working with ancient human remains — individuals who lived, suffered, and died centuries ago — and using modern science to help recover and share their stories. It’s a humbling reminder of our shared humanity across time and a moving testament to the power of science to give voice to those long silent.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While very different from COVID-19, both diseases highlight the enduring link between connectivity and pandemic risk, as well as the reality that some pathogens can never be fully eradicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been wrestling with plague for a few thousand years, and people still die from it today,” Jiang said. “Like COVID, it continues to evolve, and containment measures evidently can’t get rid of it. We have to be careful, but the threat will never go away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on the Jerash breakthrough, the team is now expanding its research to Venice, Italy, and the Lazaretto Vecchio, a dedicated quarantine island and one of the world’s most significant plague burial sites. More than 1,200 samples from this Black Death-era mass grave are now housed at USF, offering an unprecedented opportunity to study how early public health measures intersected with pathogen evolution, urban vulnerability, and cultural memory.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — West Nile virus infections are intense so far this year, with case counts running 40% higher than normal, health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 770 cases, including about 490 severe cases, were reported as of early September, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/data-maps/current-year-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;data posted this week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. About 550 cases — 350 of them severe — are usually reported by this time of year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials are ramping up warnings to the public, because most cases of the mosquito-borne disease are reported in August and September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“West Nile virus can be a very serious disease and its presence in mosquitoes remains high right now in Massachusetts,” said the state’s public health commissioner, Dr. Robbie Goldstein, in a statement last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can protect themselves by wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants when possible, and using an EPA-registered &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/mosquito-repellent-cdc-recommends-e47c0c35ffe49d6f36b39d03f1b95e06"&gt;insect repellent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; when spending time outdoors, health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus was first reported in the United States in 1999 in New York, and then gradually spread across the country. It &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/data-maps/historic-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;peaked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 2003, when nearly 10,000 cases were reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists say many people — perhaps tens of thousands each year — are infected but don’t know it because they have no symptoms, or only mild ones such as headaches, body aches, joint pain, vomiting, diarrhea and rashes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In severe cases, damage to the central nervous system causes inflammation of the brain or spinal cord, and even death.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;In the last decade, health officials have fielded reports of 2,000 cases annually on average, including 1,200 life-threatening neurological illnesses and approximately 120 deaths. Deaths are on pace to be higher this year, CDC officials said, but they declined to discuss specifics, saying mortality statistics are too preliminary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is not that there are more mosquitoes this year, but rather that a higher proportion of the bugs are carrying the virus, CDC officials said. Mosquito infection rates can be affected by such factors as temperature, rainfall, the amount of insect control going on, and how many nearby birds are infected.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Colorado, which tends to see more West Nile virus, has reported about 150 of the nation’s cases — more than double what other states are reporting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fort Collins is a hot spot. Monitoring last month in an area in the southwest part of the city found that 35 out of every 1,000 female mosquitoes were infected — far higher than the 8 per 1,000 that would be expected for that time of year — said Roxanne Connelly, a CDC entomologist who lives there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear why, but she noted it’s been a wet and warm year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

&lt;p&gt;Most conversations about menopause health revolve around things like hot flashes and brain fog, but new research points to another less discussed but no less impactful change to women’s health: voice changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All women undergo menopause, which occurs, on average, around age 52 at the point when menstruation stops occurring. In a comprehensive review of existing literature on menopause, researchers shine a spotlight on how menopausal vocal changes are both less understood and potentially more significant for certain women.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Voice changes during menopause are subtle [and] gradual but for those who use their voice a lot — voice super users — these have massive implications on their daily life and also their profession,” says &lt;a href="https://ai.northeastern.edu/our-people/rupal-patel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rupal Patel&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of communication sciences and disorders and director of the Voice of Women Lab at Northeastern University. “Many times the other symptoms of menopause have more attention but voice changes, because they’re subtle and gradual, are not necessarily given the same importance in terms of affecting the individual’s life.”&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p&gt;During menopause, estrogen levels decrease, which changes tissue in the vocal folds. The end result is women’s voices get deeper and hoarser, and it can even get harder to project the voice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In reviewing the literature around menopause, Patel and collaborators found that these changes are not well studied and “not necessarily well understood” in part because they are so gradual that most women might not notice them unless someone else draws attention to it. However, for women who use their voice a lot — teachers, reporters or voice actors, for example — these changes have much more of an impact, Patel notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you’re a teacher or in any one of these professions that uses the voice a lot, it can actually mean a difference between taking days off of work and being productive or not,” Patel says. “Voice-over actors who are females often complain that they’re no longer desirable voices.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s actually a big issue because most of the voice super users, 75% of them are women,” Patel adds. “If you think about teachers, 75% of teachers are women. If you think about voice-over artists, there’s just a high predominance of women.”&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p&gt;Another reason very little attention has been paid to menopausal vocal changes is that they have historically been conflated with other conditions. As much as Patel and her Voice of Women Lab, or VOxx Lab, are trying to analyze the voice as a marker for certain health conditions, she notes that the human voice is a “sensitive kind of cue.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If someone’s voice changes, we don’t know if it’s due to these hormonal changes or due to a neurological change,” Patel says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Patel and her lab aim to fill the knowledge gap around these vocal changes that all women will go through in their lives. New technology, like artificial intelligence, has unlocked the potential to study the human voice in even more subtle ways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previously, Patel, through the company she founded, VocaliD, cloned the voices of female voice-over artists with their permission, partially as a way of preempting some of the issues women face later in their careers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They knew that people would have less interest in their voice as they aged, and they thought that would be an insurance policy,” Patel says. “If they banked their voice ahead of time, created their synthetic voice, they could still speak as their younger selves with their synthetic voice and then as their voice ages take on other roles.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finding the gaps that have existed in previous research has spurred new lines of research that Patel and her collaborators are in the early stages of pursuing. They include an examination of how hormone replacement therapy can help improve women’s voices later in life and even a study of how menopausal changes to the oral cavity can trigger sleep apnea in women.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The end goal of all this work, Patel says, is to better understand, and potentially remedy, something that for far too long has been understudied and underdiscussed, despite being a factor in half of the population’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“How can this be ignored for so long when 100% of women, regardless of whether you’ve had a child or not, are going to go through menopause?” Patel says.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The mortality rate in the United States declined by 3.8% in 2024, and COVID-19 was no longer among the 10 leading causes of death, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr039.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;a federal report&lt;/a&gt; released Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using provisional death certificate data, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics estimates there were 3,072,039 deaths last year, which equates to about 722 deaths per 100,000 people compared to 750.5 per 100,000 in 2023. This is the lowest death rate since 2020, the authors of the report note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for the first time since 2020, COVID-19 was not one of the 10 leading causes of death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top three causes of death were heart disease with 683,037 deaths, cancer with 619,812 and unintentional injury with 196,488. The other leading causes were stroke, chronic lower respiratory disease, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, kidney disease, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, and suicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the overall death rate decline, deaths for both heart disease and cancer, the two leading causes, increased from 2023. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broken down by demographics, death rates were highest for males, older adults and Black people, the data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are limited due to the use of provisional data, but the estimates still give "researchers and policymakers an early signal about shifts in mortality trends," the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S., &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/heart-disease-risk-factors/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;a survey from the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; earlier this year found many Americans are unaware of the &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch-out-for-these-top-heart-disease-risk-factors/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;risk factors&lt;/a&gt;, including things like tobacco use and air pollution. And the risk doesn't appear to be slowing anytime soon — &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/61-percent-us-adults-cardiovascular-disease-2050-american-heart-association/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;a 2024 report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from the American Heart Association projected more than six in 10 U.S. adults, about 61%, will have some type of cardiovascular disease by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;h2&gt;Reducing anxiety and providing reassurance for patients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team at Penn is currently enrolling patients in &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search/v?id=NCI-2021-12420"&gt;two ongoing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials-search/v?id=NCI-2021-06208"&gt;large-scale studies&lt;/a&gt; that could help support their findings. Trial sites are located across the country, including &lt;a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/acc-cancer-research/breast-cancer-tce/"&gt;at the University of Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal, Chodosh said, is to not only identify and treat those who are at a higher risk of recurrence, but to be able to offer reassurance to survivors who don’t have dormant cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The goal would be to get a test that’s so good that, if you’re negative with this test, you could confidently say your risk of recurring is extremely low over the course of your lifetime,” he said. “That would have such a big benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers are also following breast cancer survivors who don’t ever test positive for dormant cancer cells in order to compare their long-term survival outcomes to those who get treated for sleeper cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some clinicians and experts were worried about whether participation in these kinds of trials would cause more distress in survivors, DiMichele said. But her team studied that, too, and found it to be the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Regardless of the answer, whether the patient found out they were positive or negative, overall their anxiety went down,” she said. “And we think it’s because, and what patients tell us is, ‘Look, at least I’m doing something.’ It was the not doing something, not knowing, that was so anxiety-provoking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, LaScala has become more involved in research efforts and now serves as a patient advocate on research boards at Penn, where she can help shape studies and participant guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among breast cancer survivors, she said there has always been passion and an eagerness for &lt;a href="https://whyy.org/articles/breast-density-cancer-mammogram-counseling/"&gt;advancing testing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/treatment.html"&gt;treatment options&lt;/a&gt; for everyone — survivors, people actively battling disease and those who may one day get a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s so energizing,” LaScala said. “To be around the research and to be able to participate … it’s incredible.”&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — Lyme disease can cause serious harm, but so can bogus tests and treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complexity of diagnosing the tick-borne disease has given rise to an entire industry of unapproved tests and unproven alternative treatments that experts say should be avoided, including lasers, herbal remedies and electromagnets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It really is a buyer-beware situation,” said Dr. Robert Smith, a Lyme specialist at MaineHealth Institute for Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no one-size-fits-all approach to diagnosing Lyme. Doctors use a combination of visual clues, information reported by their patients and the standard medical test, which has a number of limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When patients show the classic symptoms — including a bull’s eye rash, fever and fatigue — a short course of antibiotics usually resolves them. But a subset of patients will go on to experience months or even years of arthritis, pain and fatigue — poorly understood symptoms that overlap with a number of other medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That has left an opening for so-called “nonstandard” Lyme tests and treatments. Interest in those products has been amplified by influencers and a growing list of celebrities attributing various health problems to the disease, most recently Justin Timberlake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That might lead patients to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on bogus tests, which aren’t covered by insurance, followed by unapproved treatments that may do more harm than good. And it’s possible some of them may not have had Lyme at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent consensus report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, Smith and other experts called for more funding and research into the chronic symptoms experienced by some Lyme patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The key thing is that these people are suffering and we need to come up with strategies to alleviate that suffering, whatever the trigger was,” Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Smith and his colleagues warn that “profiteering entities” are pushing Lyme products that are “costly, may not work and may cause harm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at the established approach for testing and treating Lyme and how to spot unproven alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The standard Lyme test comes with limits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First identified 50 years ago, Lyme disease takes its name from the Connecticut town where the earliest cases were diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge of diagnosing it begins with the standard laboratory test, which comes with a number of caveats that must be carefully weighed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bacteria that causes Lyme, carried by certain ticks in the Northeast and Midwest, doesn’t circulate throughout the body. Often it stays in the skin near the tick bite, making it hard to detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Lyme tests look for antibodies, proteins that help fight off foreign invaders, which usually only appear in the blood several weeks after an infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/what-more-can-be-done-to-treat-lyme-disease-and-its-potential-long-term-effects"&gt;What more can be done to treat Lyme disease and its potential long-term effects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the best approach available, but experts acknowledge its shortcomings: If the test is given too early it will come back negative because antibodies haven’t yet appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s one of the problems,” Smith says. “We can’t say for sure in the first couple of weeks that it’s Lyme disease or not based on these tests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, these antibodies continue to circulate in the blood long after the infection. That means the test can return a positive result years or even decades later — making it difficult to distinguish between a new case and an old one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical guidelines deal with this ambiguity by recommending doctors diagnose and start antibiotics in all patients who have the signature bull’s eye rash associated with Lyme. But as many as 30% of those infected never get the rash, causing further uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unproven options for testing are plentiful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limitations of the approved test has opened the door to alternative tests, ranging from over-the-counter kits to specialty laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more expensive tests are often ordered by self-described “Lyme literate” physicians and health providers, who may have backgrounds in fields unrelated to infectious disease, like homeopathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotting unproven Lyme tests is relatively easy, since only antibody blood tests are approved by the Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any Lyme test available for sale at a drugstore or website is unapproved, says Andrea Love, a microbiologist and director of the American Lyme Disease Foundation. Another red flag is the use of saliva, urine or other bodily fluids besides blood to detect Lyme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you see these other tests appear on the market, it’s very likely that they’re not accurate and haven’t done their due diligence, which should make people skeptical” Love says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients will bear most of the costs for unapproved tests, which may provide inaccurate information and derail a diagnosis for other conditions that are sometimes mistaken for Lyme, such as rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While acceptance of post-treatment Lyme is growing, Love and some other experts recommend caution when approaching the topic. Studies estimate that 10% to 20% of people treated for Lyme will have ongoing symptoms that can’t be clearly explained. But she and others point to startlingly high numbers of people reporting such problems in regions that have no documented history of Lyme, such as Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The sheer number of people who believe they have these post-treatment Lyme symptoms is orders of magnitude higher than what you would expect among people who legitimately have Lyme,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Serious risks with alternative Lyme treatments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the downsides of ineffective Lyme tests are considerable, experts say they are often the gateway to even riskier therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent medical paper documented nearly 120 clinics across the U.S. offering unproven Lyme treatments, some with consultation fees as high as $3,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatments include electrical stimulation, “ozone-based therapy” and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, procedures that aren’t covered by insurance and can carry price tags as high as $6,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love and other doctors say the most worrisome approach involves long-term intravenous use of antibiotics — sometimes multiple drugs for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While antibiotics are effective for quickly killing Lyme bacteria, multiple large studies have shown no benefits to their long-term use for chronic Lyme symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith and other experts have reported cases of patients who spent years getting regular antibiotic infusions, only to develop life-threatening gut infections after the drugs killed off healthy bacteria needed to support the digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is clearly harm being done to people who are suffering and who, out of desperation, take on these great expenses or can be harmed by treatments that are not proven effective,” Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;

In brief, the data were processed for each batch as follows. First, idats files were loaded into a RGChannelSet object, and minfi quality metrics using the qcReport function were performed, removing samples with unexpected distributions of methylation values (that is, distributions markedly distinct from a bimodal centred around 0 and 1 β-values and/or from the remaining samples) and low signal intensities of internal control probes for each sample, including bisulfite conversions I and II, extension hybridization, hybridization, non-polymorphic, specificities I and II, and target removal probes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, further quality metrics were derived using the function minfiQC on the unnormalized RGChannelSet obejct. Those samples with median signal intensities of unmethylated and methylated channels of at least 10.5 in log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; scale were considered as having good signal intensities. Subsequently, detection &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were calculated across all CpGs and samples using the detectionP function for the unnormalized RGChannelSet object. Samples were considered as good if having a mean detection &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value across all CpGs of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; ≤ 0.01. On a CpG level, we retained CpGs with a detection &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; ≤ 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−16&lt;/sup&gt; in 90% or more of the samples, which has been shown to improve the quality of downstream analyses&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 52" title="Lehne, B. et al.

The RGChannelSet object was normalized with the single-sample batch-independent preprocessNoob function with dye bias correction. We next retained only CpGs (excluding CH probes) that did not contain any SNP neither in the interrogated CpGs nor in the probe extension using the dropMethylationLoci and dropLociWithSnps functions with default options (minor allele frequency (MAF) = 0). Further analyses using long-read nanopore data, Illumina array control probes, annotation packages and a data-driven approach were used to ensure the lack of any genetic confounding in the methylation values of the resulting fCpGs (see the next sections).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, CpGs with any previous evidence of potential cross-hybridization were excluded&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 54" title="Chen, Y.

                    &lt;p&gt;Unlikely to be associated with specific cell or cancer types.

We first excluded the possibility that common germline SNPs caused methylation heterogeneity at fCpG sites between individuals. We observed very distinct methylation dynamics of array control probes containing SNPs (which had been removed during the initial array processing) versus fCpGs. SNP probes showed the same distribution in all samples (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#Fig7"&gt;2c&lt;/a&gt;), including longitudinally followed cases (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#MOESM1"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;), whereas fCpGs only showed a W distribution in cancer samples with ongoing fluctuations over time. Thus, although SNPs reflect the stable genetic identity of the individual, fCpGs reflect the identity of a single cell and its evolving lineage. In addition, we used the packages SNPlocs.Hsapiens.dbSNP155.GRCh38 (v0.99.24) and MafH5.gnomAD.v4.0.GRCh38 (v3.19) to check for any known significant germline or somatic genetic confounding on the resulting 978 fCpGs. We found approximately 60% of fCpGs reported in the gnomAD v4 database (with the array background having approximately 65%), but with a very low MAF (median of 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; and mean of 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;). To exclude the possibility of unknown or very rare genetic confounding, we used the data-driven gaphunting algorithm&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 57" title="Andrews, S.

Finally, Oxford Nanopore long read of a subset of normal and neoplastic samples further validated that fCpGs represent de/methylated cytosines (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#Fig7"&gt;2d,e&lt;/a&gt;; see next section).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec14"&gt;Generation and analyses of long-read nanopore data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For long-read methylation sequencing in CLL and Richter transformation samples, concentration was assessed using the Qubit assay and DNA integrity was analysed either with the Femto Pulse System (Agilent) or the Fragment Analyzer (Agilent). When more than 6 µg of material with good integrity was available, DNA was additionally treated with the Short Fragment Eliminator Kit XS (PacBio) and eluted in EB buffer. Approximately 4 µg of DNA was used for library preparation according to the standard LSK114 kit and protocol from Oxford Nanopore. The time for DNA repair and end-prep was increased up to 30 min at 20 °C and 30 min at 65 °C. Adapter ligation was performed for 1 h at room temperature. All elutions were performed at 37 °C for 1.5 h, and 550–600 ng of DNA was loaded onto a FLO-PRO114M (CLL cells) flow cells. Flow cells were washed (EXP-WSH004) after 1–2 days, if pore count decreased to less than 30%. A total of 1–4 washes were performed for each flow cell. Flow cells were run for 100 (CLL cells) hours in total with the Fast model (MinKNOW 23.11.7, Dorado 7.2.13). The raw data were rebasecalled using dorado duplex (v0.5.3) and applying the SUP and modified call to detect 5mC and 5hmC, (model dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_sup@v4.3.0_5mCG_5hmCG@v1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In normal B cell samples, 1–3 µg of DNA was used for WGS. Libraries were prepared with the DNA ligation kit LSK110 with no modifications. Libraries were loaded onto a flow cell version FLO-PRO002 (R9.4) and were run for 90–110 h. The basecalling was performed on live mode with the Guppy basecaller (v6.2.7), included in the MinKNOW (v22.08.6), using the SUP model for base modification detection of 5mC and 5hmC (dna_r9.4.1_450bps_modbases_5hmc_5mc_cg_sup.cfg).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all samples, the generated unmapped BAM files after the basecalling were converted to FASTQ files using the SAMtools fastq -T Mm, Ml command. The FASTQ files were then mapped to BAM files using the command minimap2 -ax map-ont -y../GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fna.mmi. The methylation values were extracted from the BAMs into bedMethyl files using the in-house tool bam2bedmethyl (v0.3.2) and compressed/indexed using bgzip/tabix. Reads from each strand were combined to generate DNA matrices for each CpG and were used for obtaining the methylation values of all fCpGs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, mini BAM files containing all reads from the 976 fCpGs were generated (in hg38 genome assembly). The reads showed excellent mappability, with a mean of perfect nucleotide matches (NM tag; Levenshtein distance) for all fCpGs across samples of 96.41% (range of 73.31–97.90), and mean mapping quality (MAPQ) of all the reads covering all fCpGs across samples of 59.510 (range of 2–60). Subsequently, long reads were phased using variants called using Clair 3 (v1.0.9, model r941_prom_hac_g360 + g422)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 58" title="Zheng, Z. et al.

The methylation status of each CpG was called using the modcall function within the Longphase package. At fCpGs, only 2.7% of the reads were non-canonical bases (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#Fig7"&gt;2d&lt;/a&gt;). The variant allele frequency (VAF) of these mutations tended to be low and was negatively correlated with the coverage at that site (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#MOESM1"&gt;4a&lt;/a&gt;). Hence, the majority of these non-canonical base pairs are probably due to errors in nucleotide assignment. There is also no association between the methylation status of different reads and the variants present within a 50-bp window of each fCpG locus (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#MOESM1"&gt;4b&lt;/a&gt;). Hence, assessment of fCpG methylation via bead array was not majorly confounded by miscalled variants. The fCpG methylation patterns seen in the bead array data were replicated in the long-read data (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#Fig7"&gt;2e&lt;/a&gt;) and the correlation between the fraction methylated measured via bead array and long-read sequencing at fCpGs was excellent (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#Fig7"&gt;2e&lt;/a&gt;). The same correspondence was observed in WGBS data (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#Fig7"&gt;2f&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess the intra-sample long-read diversity for each sample, the pairwise Hamming distances were calculated between every read on both haplotypes. The two lists of Hamming distances were concatenated, and the mean calculated as a summary statistic of the read diversity for each sample. One normal B cell sample contained only two reads from one haplotype, and zero from the other, and so was excluded from further analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec15"&gt;Analysis of scRRBS data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously published single-cell reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (scRRBS) data were obtained&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 6" title="Gaiti, F. et al.

There was a high dropout rate, so to extract meaningful patterns we plotted a subset of 40 cells and 20 fCpGs with a high density and overlap of fCpGs across single cells as examples (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#MOESM1"&gt;5a,b&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To compare the full set of data accounting for the high degree of missing data, we used a metric of heterogeneity at a given fCpG that weights by the number of non-missing fCpGs according to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equa" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${d}_{i}=\sqrt{\frac{{n}_{i}({n}_{i}-1)}{2}}\sigma ({\beta }_{i})$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of non-NaN values for the &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;th fCpG, &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\)&lt;/span&gt; is the total possible pairwise comparisons between a set of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; objects and &lt;i&gt;σ&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) is the standard deviation across the methylation values of the &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;th fCpG (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#MOESM1"&gt;5c&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec16"&gt;Characterization and annotation of fCpGs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To characterize the genomic and regulatory context of fCpGs, we used a series of statistical analyses and database annotations. We annotated fCpGs using Illumina manifest and other genomic annotation packages available at Bioconductor including IlluminaHumanMethylation450kanno.ilmn12.hg19 (v0.6.1) and IlluminaHumanMethylationEPICanno.ilm10b2.hg19 (v0.6.0). We additionally used the packages SNPlocs.Hsapiens.dbSNP155.GRCh38 (v0.99.24) and MafH5.gnomAD.v4.0.GRCh38 (v3.19) to check any possible germline or somatic genetic confounding on the resulting 978 fCpGs.

In addition, we used the Illumina 450k and EPIC array internal SNP probes and showed a dramatically distinct methylation dynamics compared with fCpGs in single-timepoint (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#Fig7"&gt;2c&lt;/a&gt;) and longitudinal (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#MOESM1"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;) samples.

Initially, our model focused on neutral evolution, before expanding to non-neutral modes of tumour evolution below. For the full explanation of the model, see the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#MOESM1"&gt;Supplementary Information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our model was parameterized in terms of the age of the patient at which the MRCA emerged (&lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;), the exponential growth rate of the cancer (&lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt;) and the epigenetic switching rates of the fCpGs (&lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ν&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ζ&lt;/i&gt;). The model was partitioned into two phases: before and after the emergence of the MRCA. At time &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; = 0, the fCpGs were assumed to be equally likely to be homozygously methylated or demethylated. The fCpG status of the MRCA at time &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt; was calculated by applying matrix exponentiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second phase of the model consisted of a discrete time Markov process. The effective population size of the growing cancer was modelled as growing according to a deterministic exponential growth equation, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; − &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;. Each fCpG was considered independently; at each time step, &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; → &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; + &lt;i&gt;δt&lt;/i&gt;, the number of homozygous-methylated (&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;), heterozygous-methylated (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;) and homozygous-demethylated cells (&lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt;) at a specific fCpG was updated according to the epigenetic switching rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of sample, &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;, the fraction methylation of each simulated fCpG was calculated by summing the number of methylated alleles and normalizing by the total number of alleles in the population:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equb" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${\beta }_{c}=\frac{k+2m}{2{N}_{e}}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We further accounted for contaminating normal cells and the technical noise introduced by the methylation bead array. The methylation of the contaminated samples was assumed to be an average of the cancer methylation, &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;), weighted by the tumour purity &lt;i&gt;ρ&lt;/i&gt;, and the average of the normal population, &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, weighted by &lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt; − &lt;i&gt;ρ&lt;/i&gt;.

                &lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;span class="u-custom-list-number"&gt;(1)&lt;/span&gt;
                  
                    &lt;p&gt;A subclonal selection model in which a single cell within the cancer develops a selective advantage and begins to grow at an increased growth rate.&lt;/p&gt;
                  
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;span class="u-custom-list-number"&gt;(2)&lt;/span&gt;
                  
                    &lt;p&gt;An independent clonal origins model, in which a patient has developed two distinct cancers concurrently.&lt;/p&gt;
                  
                &lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the subclonal selection model, we replaced the growth rate (&lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt;) and the time of the MRCA (&lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;) with the growth rates and time of the MRCA of the initial, slower-growing population (&lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively), and that of the more recently emerging, faster-growing population (&lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), constraining &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; &lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#Fig13"&gt;8a&lt;/a&gt;). We assumed that the initial cancer population began exponentially growing at &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; as above, but at time &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, we selected a single cell with a set of fCpG states drawn according to the cancer population and allowed this second population to grow concurrently with a growth rate &lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The independent-cancer model followed the same scheme as the nested subclonal selection model, except the methylation status of the emerging cancer was that of an independent cell that experienced random fluctuations between &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; = 0 and &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we let the number of cells in the less fit subclone in each methylation state be {&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;} and in the fitter subclone be {&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}, following the convention above, then in both cases the measured methylation patterns at the time of sample are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equc" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${\beta }_{c}(T)=\frac{{k}_{1}(T)+2{m}_{1}(T)+{k}_{2}(T)+2{m}_{2}(T)}{2{N}_{e}(T)}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({N}_{e}(T)={e}^{{\theta }_{1}(T-{\tau }_{1})}+{e}^{{\theta }_{2}(T-{\tau }_{2})}\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec21"&gt;Adaption of simulations to a longitudinal setting&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We modified the simulations of how the fCpG methylation distribution changes over time to allow for multiple sequential sample collections. These simulations allow for neutral, independent clones, a single subclonal expansion or two subclonal expansions, which can either be nested or emerge from the clonal trunk in parallel. This required pre-specification of sampling times, along with the emergence times of any subclones or independent clones, which we collected to form a set of ‘landmark times’. The discrete time steps of the simulation were split into phases between the landmark times, which evolved according to the discrete time Markov process outlined above. At each sampling time, the fCpG methylation fraction was calculated as above and stored as a column in the output matrix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec22"&gt;Prior functions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each methylation array blood sample, we had matched age (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;) and purity (&lt;i&gt;ρ&lt;/i&gt;) information. Hence, the parameters to be inferred are the growth rate (&lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt;), the age of the patient when the MRCA emerged (&lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;), the epigenetic switching rates (&lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ν&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ζ&lt;/i&gt;), the average fraction methylated of contaminating normal cells (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;), the β-offsets from 0 and 1 due to the background noise on the methylation array (&lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ε&lt;/i&gt;, respectively) and the precision of the β-distributed noise (&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These parameters are constrained either to be positive (&lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;μ, ν&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ζ&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0) or to lie within a specified range (0 &amp;lt; &lt;i&gt;τ/T&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ε&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 1), which we achieved using appropriate prior distributions. To better allow for priors to be set on a biologically meaningful scale, the priors for the log-normal distribution were set in terms of the real scale mean and standard deviation, rather than the standard log-scale. To reduce correlations in the posterior and make sampling more efficient, the variables &lt;i&gt;ν&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ζ&lt;/i&gt; were normalized by &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The priors are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equd" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\theta  \sim {\rm{lognormal}}(\mathrm{3,2})$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="Eque" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\frac{\tau }{T} \sim {\rm{beta}}(2,2)$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="Equf" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\mu  \sim {\rm{halfnormal}}(0,0.05)$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="Equg" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\gamma  \sim {\rm{halfnormal}}(0,0.05)$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="Equh" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\frac{\upsilon }{\mu } \sim {\rm{lognormal}}(1,0.7)$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="Equi" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\frac{\zeta }{\gamma } \sim {\rm{lognormal}}(1,0.7)$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="Equj" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${\beta }_{n} \sim {\rm{beta}}(2,2)$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="Equk" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\delta  \sim {\rm{beta}}(5,95)$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="Equl" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${\epsilon } \sim {\rm{beta}}(95,5)$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="Equm" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\kappa  \sim {\rm{halfnormal}}(100,30)$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When fitting non-neutral models of tumour growth, the inference was parameterized in terms of the relative growth of the fitter subclone, &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({\tilde{\theta }}_{2}=\frac{{\theta }_{2}}{{\theta }_{1}}\)&lt;/span&gt;, and the fraction of the population consisting of the fitter subclone, &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(f=\frac{{e}^{{\theta }_{2}(t-{\tau }_{2})}}{{e}^{{\theta }_{1}(t-{\tau }_{1})}+{e}^{{\theta }_{2}(t-{\tau }_{2})}}\)&lt;/span&gt;.

Individual switching rate parameters (&lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ν&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ζ&lt;/i&gt;) were largely uninformative of prognosis and were summarized into a mean epigenetic switching rate, which was scaled by a factor of 100. In addition, growth rate and effective population were analysed as continuous variables in multivariate Cox regression models together with &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt; aberrations (considering mutations and deletions together), IGHV gene mutational status and the age of patients at sampling. Kaplan–Meier curves were generated for low and high growth rates and effective population size within IGHV subtypes using maximally selected log-rank statistic using the maxstats package (v0.7-25). &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values from Kaplan–Meier curves were derived using the log-rank statistic. Survival (v3.5-7), survminer (v0.4.9) and ggsurvfit (v0.3.1) packages were used under R (v4.3.1). Plots were generated using ggplot2 (v3.5.2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec30"&gt;Estimating the rate of change in lymphocyte counts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historical records of the absolute number of lymphocytes in blood obtained via haemocytometer were collected for patients with CLL over the whole disease course (that is, an approximate of the number of malignant CLL cells in blood). In 231 patients with CLL, we could obtain at least 10 sample timepoints (that is, at least 10 medical appointments, median &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 27 and mean &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 34) before the first treatment, allowing us to track the natural history of the disease before treatment intervention for the tumour (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#MOESM1"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;).

Four attendees were infected with the highly infectious disease, none of whom were vaccinated, but more are feared to be sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The newest cases bring the state’s total measles count to 24. All but one of those patients had been vaccinated before getting sick. Nationwide, the US is facing the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14772281/US-map-measles-MMR-vaccine-rate-study.html"&gt;largest measles caseload&lt;/a&gt;, over 1,400 infections, since the virus was declared ‘eliminated’ in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is an infectious, preventable disease caused by a virus that leads to flu-like symptoms, a rash that starts on the face and spreads downward across the body, and, in severe cases, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/pneumonia/index.html" id="mol-f7dd5c60-8e51-11f0-a9b3-618ddb70db89"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;, seizures, brain inflammation, permanent brain damage, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The virus is spread through direct contact with infectious droplets or through the air. Patients with a measles infection are contagious from four days before the rash through four days after the rash appears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14583809/rfk-jr-u-turn-mmr-vaccine-measles-outbreak-milestone.html"&gt;who are not vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; have a 90 percent chance of getting sick if they are exposed, even from sharing the same air, briefly or hours later, with someone who has measles. Three in 1,000 people who contract measles will die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The two-dose measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) is about 97 percent effective at preventing the infection and is recommended as part of the childhood vaccine schedule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US has recorded 1,454 cases of measles this year, with 266 of those cases having been confirmed within the past two months. Three people, including one in Colorado and two children in Texas, have died this year from the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Several people have been infected with measles after a mass exposure at the Utah High School Cycling League event in Soldier Hollow on August 16&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Soldier Hollow, Utah, event was a competition for teen cyclists, with teams that came from all over the state, which has a population of 3.5million people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Leisha Nolen, an epidemiologist with the state of Utah, said: ‘Measles is highly contagious and spreads easily, even at outdoor events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Given the number of people who may have been exposed to measles at Soldier Hollow on August 16, 2025, we encourage attendees and participants of upcoming Utah High School Cycling League Region 6 events to check their MMR vaccination status.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An estimated 90 percent of Utahns have received the MMR vaccine, below the CDC's target rate of 95 percent, the level needed to prevent community transmission of measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Immunization rates for specific vaccines in Utah have decreased among kindergartners statewide since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rate fell from an average of more than 85 percent for the 2014-2015 school year statewide to slightly over 78 percent for the 2024-2025 school year, the second lowest rate since 77.4 percent were vaccinated in the 2020-2021 school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Utah State Epidemiologist Leisha Nolan stated that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent the measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Public health officials are working with the Utah High School Cycling League to inform families of the race participants who attended the Soldier Hollow event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The virus virus leads to flu-like symptoms, a rash that starts on the face and spreads downward across the body, and, in severe cases, pneumonia , seizures, brain inflammation, permanent brain damage, and death (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The US has reported more than 1,400 measles cases in 2025, the highest tally since the disease was declared 'eliminated' in 2000 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before the current two-dose childhood vaccine’s approval in 1968, there were up to 500 US deaths each year from measles, 48,000 hospitalizations, and 1,000 cases of brain swelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, the virus is almost completely preventable, with a vaccine efficacy rate of 97 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sporadic outbreaks have occurred since the virus was declared ‘eliminated’ by health agencies in 2000, but recent case counts are a tiny fraction of the 27,000 cases reported in 1990 or the 450,000 cases reported in 1964.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The skyrocketing rate of measles cases in the US among a growing number of children and adults who have not been vaccinated has been attributed to renewed fervor in the anti-vax movement stoked by HHS Secretary Robert F Kennedy, Jr. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A long-time vaccine skeptic, RFK Jr in the past has parroted the widely debunked link between the MMR shots and autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;RFK has also relayed mixed messages about the MMR vaccine, saying at once that it is the most effective way to prevent measles, while also telling Congress that he believes that the increased risk of autism in children is in part due to a wide array of childhood immunizations recommended now compared to when he was a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;US MMR vaccination coverage among kindergartners dropped to 92 percent nationwide for the 2024–2025 school year, a decline from 95 percent during the 2019–2020 school year and is below the 95 percent threshold needed for herd immunity to protect communities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Texas is a hotspot for measles, though outbreaks have cropped up nationwide in 2025 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He has also endorsed cod liver oil and vitamin A as treatments for measles. Doctors use doses of vitamin A as a supportive treatment in patients in the early stages of measles, but it is not a cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In high doses, vitamin A supplementation can be toxic and potentially lead to chronic liver damage and failure, as well as death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is generally used for people with measles in parts of the world where a deficiency in the vitamin is common, which increases the risk of severe or deadly outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin A deficiency in the US affects less than one percent of the population, and last spring, Texas doctors saw a jump in the number of children with measles who had potentially irreversible vitamin A toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excessive alcohol consumption can disrupt the liver's unique regenerative abilities by trapping cells in limbo between their functional and regenerative states, even after a patient stops drinking, researchers at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and collaborators at Duke University and the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Chicago describe in a new study.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;This in-between state is a result of inflammation disrupting how RNA is spliced during the protein-making process, the researchers found, providing scientists with new treatment pathways to explore for the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/deadly+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;deadly disease&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63251-2" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; their findings in the journal &lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liver has a remarkable ability to regenerate itself after damage or partial removal. However, it loses that ability in patients with alcohol-associated liver disease—the leading cause of liver-related mortality worldwide, resulting in roughly 3 million deaths annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We knew that the liver stops functioning and stops regenerating in patients with alcohol-related hepatitis and cirrhosis, even when a patient has discontinued consuming alcohol, but we didn't know why," said U. of I. biochemistry professor Auinash Kalsotra, who co-led the study with Duke University School of Medicine professor Anna Mae Diehl. "The only real life-saving treatment option once a patient reaches the liver failure stage in those diseases is transplantation. But if we understood why these livers were failing, maybe we could intervene."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the Kalsotra and Diehl labs have studied the molecular and cellular underpinnings of liver regeneration. Over the last five years, they found that in order to regenerate, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/liver+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;liver cells&lt;/a&gt; reprogram their &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gene+expression/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gene expression&lt;/a&gt; to revert to fetal-like progenitor cells, multiply and then reverse the process back to become mature functioning cells again. Armed with this knowledge, the group turned to the question of how those mechanisms were disrupted in alcohol-associated liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The researchers compared samples of healthy livers and samples of livers with alcohol-associated hepatitis or cirrhosis obtained from Johns Hopkins University Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing the researchers noticed in diseased livers was that, although damaged cells had begun the process of reverting to the regenerative state, they did not complete the process and instead remained in transitional limbo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They are neither functional adult cells nor proliferative progenitor cells. Since they are not functioning, more pressure builds on the remaining cells. So they try to regenerate, and they're all ending up in this unproductive quasi-progenitor state, and that's what is causing liver failure," said U. of I. graduate students Ullas Chembazhi and Sushant Bangru, the co-first authors of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To figure out why the cells were getting stuck in this state, the team investigated which proteins were being made by the liver cells and, in turn, the RNA molecules carrying the instructions for those proteins from the DNA to the cell's protein-building machinery.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most studies focus only on the total amounts of RNA or protein in a cell, Kalsotra's team used deep RNA sequencing technology and computational analyses to zoom in on the splicing of RNA fragments, a key step in stitching together different parts of genetic instructions to make proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In comparing the samples, we saw RNA was getting misspliced broadly in alcohol-related liver disease, across thousands of genes, and it was affecting major functions of proteins," said Kalsotra, who also is affiliated with the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology at Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;The researchers found a possible driver of the RNA missplicing: Alcohol-damaged liver cells had a deficiency of the protein ESRP2, which binds to RNA to splice it properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Proteins function at a very specific place in the cell, and that is directed by sequences within the protein that take the protein to that particular spot. We found that, in many cases, the sequence that dictates where the protein localizes within a cell was misspliced. That's why it was important that we did the multiple analyses we did," said Kalsotra, also a member of the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There was the same amount of RNA and protein, but the protein was not at the right place to function. Due to missplicing, key proteins that are required for productive liver regeneration were getting stuck in the cytoplasm, when they needed to be in the nucleus."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To verify that ESRP2 deficiency was a likely culprit, the researchers studied mice without the gene that produces ESRP2. They displayed similar liver damage and regeneration failure to that seen in patients with advanced alcohol-related hepatitis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why was ESRP2 missing from liver cells from patients with alcohol-related hepatitis? Upon investigation, the researchers found that liver support cells and immune cells, drawn to the liver tissue damaged by alcohol processing, released high amounts of inflammatory and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/growth+factors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;growth factors&lt;/a&gt;. Those factors suppress ESRP2 production and activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To verify this finding, the researchers treated liver cell cultures with a molecule that inhibits the receptor for one of the inflammation-promoting factors. ESRP2 levels recovered and splicing activity was corrected, pointing to the pathway as a possible treatment target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm hopeful these findings will become a launching pad for future clinical studies. We can use these misspliced RNAs as diagnostic markers or develop treatments that can curb the inflammation. And if we can correct the splicing defects, then maybe we can improve recovery and restore damaged livers," Kalsotra said.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — The Center for Disease Control and Prevention is warning people of a deadly bug that can be found in Arkansas and other states.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insect is known scientifically as Triatominae and commonly by its nickname the "kissing bug." &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insect has the ability to transmit Chagas disease. an illness that is primarily found in the rural areas of Mexico, Central America and South America. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently Chagas disease has been reported in 32 states and out of those states, eight states have reported human cases. Those states are as follows: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee and Texas. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC has said that roughly 8 million globally have the disease, which includes roughly 280,000 in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials with the CDC said that many times people are unaware that they even know they have the illness, but that if the illness is left untreated it can be deadly. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what you need to know about the disease and the insect:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does the "kissing bug" look like? &lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kissing bug is primarily known for its distinctive orange-red to yellowish markings on its body and wings. According to the CDC, here's a look at the key characteristics for the insect: &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul id="isPasted"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Orange-red to yellowish horizontal markings covering less than one-fourth of abdominal segment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mouthparts relatively hairless&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pronotum black with orange-red to yellowish side and top margins&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tip of scutellum long, narrow&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Distinctive orange-red to yellowish markings on wings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How is Chagas disease spread?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, Chagas disease is caused by a parasite named Trypanosoma cruzi — this parasite is usually spread through contact with the "kissing bugs." &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health professionals shared that the kissing bugs bite and suck blood animals and people who are infected, which causes the insects to then become infected with the parasite. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After biting, the bugs poop, and the poop has the parasite within it. From there, if the insect's poop gets in someone's body either through a cut, eyes, or mouth, it can lead to an infection. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC officials said that people could subconsciously rub the feces into a cut, eyes, or mouth without even knowing it. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="isPasted"&gt;Symptoms of Chagas disease in adults&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health professionals said that shortly after infection, a type of eyelid swelling known as Romaña's sign may appear.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling tired&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Body aches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rash&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loss of appetite&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diarrhea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vomiting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others impacted by the disease may experience symptoms for years or a lifetime — health officials said that is known as the "chronic phase of infection," and can include heart and digestive issues.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="isPasted"&gt;Avoiding the "kissing bugs"&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are no vaccines or drugs that can prevent Chagas disease, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, health officials emphasized that it's important to protect yourself through preventative measures. Here's a look at prevention measures you can take: &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Staying in well-built places if traveling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using insecticides and bug spray&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wearing clothes that cover your skin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not eating raw fruits and vegetable (the infection can be acquired orally or via contaminated food).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

This phase may last a few years and is characterized by irregular cycles, hot flashes, mood swings, sleep problems, and metabolic changes. It is often thought of as a simple hormonal change, but is a crucial time for early screenings and preventative medical treatment because it also occurs when women are more susceptible to osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and many types of cancer.&lt;br&gt;Here are six ways perimenopause quietly increases cancer risk and how awareness and prompt action can be lifesaving.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 18:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>“接吻虫”病在美国呈上升趋势- TribLIVE.com</title><link>https://triblive.com/local/regional/kissing-bug-disease-on-the-rise-in-u-s/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storyContent"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deadly malady known as “kissing bug” disease is now an endemic illness in the United States, according to the &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nation is seeing a rise in the illness, which is officially known as Chagas disease.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be life-threatening and is transmitted through “kissing bugs” that bite human faces, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/09/kissing-bug-disease-chagas-endemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Washington Post reported&lt;/a&gt;. Pets can carry the disease.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A disease is considered endemic when it is constantly present within a specific area or population.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 100 million people worldwide are considered at risk of being infected with Chagas disease, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis)#:~:text=development%20of%20information%2C%20education%20and,up%2C%20and%20notification%20of%20cases." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;World Health &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis)#:~:text=development%20of%20information%2C%20education%20and,up%2C%20and%20notification%20of%20cases." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Organization&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “kissing bug” itself is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which is found in the feces of the triatomine bug — commonly known as the “kissing bug” because it often bites people’s faces, the Post said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insects can become infected when they feed on the blood of hosts carrying the parasite.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans and animals can become infected in a few ways, according to the Post:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When contaminated feces are accidentally rubbed into open wounds, the eyes or the mouth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From pregnant mother to child&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Through contaminated blood transfusions (but this is rarer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogs are one of the animals that can host the parasite, and there has been growing evidence of canine infections in states including Texas and California.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are at least eight states where cases of Chagas disease have been identified: California, Arizona, Texas, Tennessee, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi and Arkansas.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kissing bugs themselves “occur naturally in the southern half of the country and have been identified in 32 states,” according to the CDC, the Post said. They’re often found in rural parts of Mexico, Central America and South America.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;No vaccines&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There aren’t any vaccines or drugs right now to prevent Chagas disease, the CDC said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in the U.S., two anti-parasitic medicines have been approved for those who are suspected to have been infected, the Post said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitigation tactics include:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spraying areas with long-lasting insecticides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wearing clothing that covers the skin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoiding raw vegetables and unpeeled fruits in areas where Chagas disease has been detected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pet owners can help prevent Chagas disease by using anti-flea and tick medications such as Nexgard and Bravecto.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When traveling in areas where the insects are present, the CDC recommended reducing the risk of contact with infected kissing bugs, which are “sometimes found in the cracks and crevices of poorly constructed houses and can survive both indoors and outdoors,” according to the Post.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two phases of Chagas disease — acute and chronic — with the former potentially being asymptomatic.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acute phase happens in the first few weeks or months after infection. It can cause mild symptoms like fever, fatigue, body aches or swelling of the eyelid.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People should seek treatment at this stage, the CDC advised, according to the Post.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without treatment, the chronic disease can develop, lasting for several years or even a lifetime.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As many as 30% can develop serious health complications — leading to conditions like heart failure or an enlarged esophagus or colon, according to the CDC. Others may remain asymptomatic.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is “often fatal by the time symptoms develop,” Paula Stigler Granados, an associate professor at the San Diego State University School of Public Health, told the Post.

&lt;/p&gt;

"I would recommend drinking 4 to 8 ounces of kefir every day. Start with 2 ounces per day and then work your way up to 4 to 8 ounces per day," says Castro.&lt;br&gt;

It's a warm drink that is packed with nutrients to help support the function of the intestinal barrier, says Castro.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It's rich in amino acids such as glutamine, glycine, proline, histidine, arginine, as well as minerals including calcium, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, and zinc. Getting enough minerals is essential to maintaining bone strength.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Glutamine is especially helpful in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/best-anti-inflammatory-foods-11716890" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reducing inflammation&lt;/a&gt;," says Castro. The gelatin in bone broth helps repair the gut lining, improving absorption, which is crucial as digestion capacity decreases with age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to promoting bone and gut health, bone broth can also benefit the skin.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It contains a significant amount of collagen, which helps with skin elasticity. When buying bone broth, check the label to see if it has been simmered for at least eight hours, "the levels of nutrients released from the bones are higher with longer cooking times," says Castro.&lt;br&gt;

"Chamomile or lemon balm can help with restful sleep and stress reduction, which are both crucial for aging well.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I recommend 1 cup of any flavor of herbal tea daily," says Castro.

"There is increasing evidence in favor of protective effects of coffee consumption in development and progression of liver disease. Caffeine may stimulate liver enzymes and improve liver function," says Castro.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

"If possible, it’s best to eat breakfast first, then drink it after breakfast, so you’re not consuming coffee on an empty stomach, which can irritate your stomach lining," says Balls.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While drinking coffee has health benefits, it's essential to note that adding excess sugar, cream, or flavored syrups can cancel out these benefits.

"It is rich in the polyphenol EGCG, which acts like a powerful antioxidant that helps reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which greatly impact aging," says Castro.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Green tea helps balance blood sugar, which is also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/8193876/healthy-recipes-graceful-aging" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;important for longevity&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you choose to drink green tea daily, Castro recommends 2 to 3 cups steeped for about 2 to 3 minutes and consumed before 2:00 p.m. to maximize health benefits and ensure good sleep.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Black Tea &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme figure-portrait figure-high-res"&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like green tea, black tea is from the &lt;em&gt;Camellia sinensis&lt;/em&gt; plant, but is brewed at a higher temperature and boasts a more bitter taste. Black tea contains polyphenols, such as theaflavins and thearubigins, that act like prebiotics, benefiting the bacteria in your microbiome.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "These polyphenols feed keystone strains like &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacteria&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/1542077/foods-healthy-immune-system" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support the immune system as you age&lt;/a&gt;. I recommend up to 1-2 cups of black tea daily, steeped for about 4-5 minutes before 2:00 PM to avoid sleep disruption," says Castro.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Incorporating even one of these drinks into your weekly wellness routine can support healthy aging. But drinking enough water each day is essential. "Sure, it doesn't have a lot of bells or whistles, but water is such an important part of your body, and can help manage blood sugar levels if you're adequately hydrated," says Balls. "Staying hydrated with water helps lower your risk of heart disease, kidney stones, and diabetes, which are common concerns as we age."&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-tips callout--bordered" data-text="Tip" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If plain water is hard to drink in large amounts, Castro recommends adding flavor without artificial sweeteners:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infuse with fruit:&lt;/strong&gt; Slice citrus, berries, or cucumbers to give your water a natural flavor boost.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freeze flavored ice cubes:&lt;/strong&gt; Make ice cubes from herbal tea or pureed fruit and drop them into your water for a burst of flavor as they melt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balance caffeine with water:&lt;/strong&gt; Drink a glass of water for every cup of coffee, tea, or energy drink.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set reminders: &lt;/strong&gt;If you often forget to hydrate, set gentle phone reminders for water breaks and pay attention to your body's thirst and dehydration signals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead of relying on caffeinated drinks throughout the day, check in with yourself to be sure you're drinking enough water. Staying hydrated supports energy levels, which can motivate you to be active and maintain healthy habits, says Balls. "Your hydration status is also linked to your metabolic health, crucial for fat metabolism, nutrient transport, and waste removal."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And of course, we can't forget Martha's green juice. For years, she has credited her prized green juice for contributing to her good health. "This is what I recharge my batteries with every single morning," she says. "I don't leave my house without it." &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/1050707/green-juice" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Her recipe&lt;/a&gt; includes pears, celery, cucumbers, parsley, ginger, and orange. While juice lacks the fiber of whole fruits and vegetables, green juice is a health-boosting blend that makes it easy to drink your greens. If certain ingredients are low or out of season, simply swap them out with other nutritious vegetables and fruits that you like. Note that we are referring to juice fresh-pressed at home, which doesn't include the sweeteners or other additives you might find in bottled versions.

Advice flips, trends flare up, and people are left unsure about what actually supports the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A careful look at spicy food offers a clear signal worth your attention. A new population analysis from Sichuan Province, China, tracked adults and linked frequent chili intake to lower rates of major heart and brain events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-spicy-food-and-heart-health"&gt;Spicy food and heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/706473/bio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Marialaura Bonaccio&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.reteneuroscienze.it/en/Istituto/irccs-istituto-neurologico-mediterraneo-neuromed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IRCCS&lt;/a&gt; Neuromed has spent years studying chili peppers and heart outcomes in Europe, and her work helps frame this topic globally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her perspective complements findings from China while reminding us to keep lifestyle and culture in the mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese team analyzed 54,859 adults and found that compared with people who rarely ate spicy food, those who ate it 6 to 7 days per week were less likely to develop ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also saw a reduced risk of ischemic stroke, a blockage in brain blood flow, with the likelihood of these problems dropping further as spicy food consumption became more frequent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/spicy-foods-can-slow-down-eating-and-cut-calorie-intake/"&gt;Moderate spice&lt;/a&gt; intensity tracked with a lower overall risk of cardio and cerebrovascular disease in the cohort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting regular spicy intake earlier in life also lined up with lower risk, although the effect did not extend to hemorrhagic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-food-gets-spicy"&gt;How food gets spicy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main bioactive in chilies is &lt;a href="https://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/capgen.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;capsaicin&lt;/a&gt;, which is responsible for the burning sensation people feel when eating spicy foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond taste, capsaicin works on a special sensor in the body, found in nerves and in the lining of blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When this sensor is stimulated regularly, research in animals shows that it can increase the natural production of nitric oxide, a chemical that relaxes blood vessels and helps blood flow more smoothly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process has also been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/trying-to-lower-your-blood-pressure-this-common-nutrient-can-help/"&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, especially in animals with hypertension, which is long term high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-capsaicin-and-arteries"&gt;Capsaicin and arteries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes are important because they improve the overall health of the inner walls of arteries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong, flexible arteries are better able to expand and contract, which reduces the workload on the heart and lowers the chance of damage over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better vessel relaxation means the circulatory system can adjust more easily when the body needs more blood flow, such as during exercise or stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capsaicin’s impact is not just about the immediate burning feeling on the tongue. Inside the body, it sets off chemical signals that affect how cells behave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, researchers have measured changes in proteins connected to nitric oxide pathways, and these shifts line up with long term improvements in how &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tiny-blood-vessels-may-fuel-the-spread-of-cancer-cells/"&gt;blood vessels function&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that eating spicy foods regularly may provide benefits for cardiovascular health that go well beyond flavor or temporary sensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-this-fits-with-past-evidence"&gt;How this fits with past evidence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large-scale work in China from 2004 to 2013 linked frequent spicy eating to lower all cause mortality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26242395/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study,&lt;/a&gt; participants who ate spicy food 6 or 7 days per week had a 14 percent lower risk of death than those who ate it less than once a week, with inverse associations also seen for ischemic heart disease and respiratory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate Italian &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31856971/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cohort&lt;/a&gt; found that people who ate chili peppers more than four times per week had lower total and cardiovascular mortality. The association persisted even when researchers accounted for adherence to the Mediterranean diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings from the Italian study showed that chili pepper consumption appeared to offer protection for the heart even when overall eating habits differed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefit was seen both in people who followed a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mediterranean-diet-boosts-brain-power-by-altering-the-gut/"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; and in those whose diets were less healthy, suggesting that the positive effect of chili peppers was consistent across different dietary patterns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marialaura Bonaccio, who also led this study, underscored this point when presenting the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-spicy-food-means-in-real-life"&gt;What spicy food means in real life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of these studies say &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mild-chili-peppers-may-be-the-anti-spice-weve-been-looking-for/"&gt;chili peppers&lt;/a&gt; cure heart disease. They do say that in large groups of people, more frequent spicy intake is linked to fewer heart and brain problems across time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is observational research, so cause and effect remain open questions. Still, the consistency across settings argues that spicy eating patterns often travel with other helpful choices or may deliver direct biological benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spice strength matters too. The Chinese work reported signals at weak to moderate levels, which gels with the simple idea that daily habits beat extremes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole chilies, simple sauces, and meals that use chili to season real food are sensible places to start. People with reflux, ulcers, or other conditions should adjust to tolerance and talk to a clinician if symptoms flare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limits-and-what-comes-next"&gt;Limits and what comes next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A much larger China Kadoorie Biobank incidence&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12273639/"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;followed 486,335 adults for a median of 12.1 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found lower risks of vascular disease in people who ate spicy foods one to seven days per week, with trends that held for ischemic heart disease and major coronary events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The association was particularly clear in younger adults and those living in rural regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also possible that people who enjoy spicy foods eat differently in other ways, or live in places where chili use reflects cultural patterns that bring other benefits or risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Careful sensitivity checks, such as excluding early events, help probe these points but do not close the book on causality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies could test how foods high in capsaicin or standardized chili products influence blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood vessel health over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers could also examine how chili affects nitric oxide activity in people by using amounts similar to those found in everyday cooking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cutting-through-the-noise"&gt;Cutting through the noise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutrition debates can feel noisy, yet some messages are steady. Frequent &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-chili-during-pregnancy-may-actually-be-a-good-idea/"&gt;chili&lt;/a&gt; use, inside a balanced pattern of eating, shows a consistent association with better heart and brain outcomes across very different populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People do not need to chase extreme heat or complicated protocols. A modest, regular habit built around meals you enjoy is easier to keep, and the data suggest that rhythm matters more than bragging rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taste and tolerance vary, so personal comfort should lead the way. If spicy foods agree with you, using chilies to season home cooked meals looks like a choice with upside and little downside for most healthy adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40677177/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zh&lt;/em&gt;i&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 17:56:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxOWkc1VUNKXzhlQVRrd2M2VEMzYzhydF9UNXBJVHY4bWtIaF9fRE80WDNEd3MtZmlGVVdOODJYVENUOVY5dml4ajRQcXJ3TlhtbGtQbTJZa2o0eURGQlpLSi1GekIwVWxrQ2JSd3djTjlpVEQySFFfWjVpbEIzaHVxUGdKX0JlZkc0SmhnanFHLTZYZw</guid></item><item><title>一些阿灵顿药店开始提供没有处方的Covid-19疫苗- ARLnow</title><link>https://www.arlnow.com/2025/09/10/some-arlington-pharmacies-begin-offering-covid-19-shots-without-prescriptions/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content pt-6 px-4 content-post"&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Amid &lt;a href="https://www.arlnow.com/2025/09/08/arlington-pharmacies-requiring-prescriptions-for-new-covid-19-vaccine/"&gt;shifting federal guidelines&lt;/a&gt; on Covid-19 vaccines, some pharmacies around Arlington are now offering the shots without requiring a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only days ago, all CVS locations in Virginia required a prescription for most patients to receive the latest version of the vaccine. That’s no longer the case, CVS spokesperson Amy Thibault told ARLnow today (Wednesday).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virginia is now among the states where CVS can offer the vaccine “without a patient-specific prescription.” Thibault said the company’s approach is “based on FDA approval and recent regulatory action by certain states.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Virginia law permits a prescriber to enter a protocol arrangement that authorizes pharmacist-administered vaccinations for adults,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sign at a Safeway in Falls Church also currently advertises Covid-19 shots for patients ages 18 and up, no prescription required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True to the business’s word, an ARLnow reporter successfully received a vaccine there this morning without a doctor’s prescription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_382767" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-382767" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-382767 size-full" src="https://www.arlnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_6539.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.arlnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_6539.jpg 1600w, https://www.arlnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_6539-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.arlnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_6539-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.arlnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_6539-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.arlnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_6539-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.arlnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_6539-730x548.jpg 730w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-382767" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A sign advertising free Covid-19 shots at a Safeway in Falls Church (staff photo by Vernon Miles)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tipster told ARLnow that all 33 Safeway locations with pharmacies in Virginia have the same policy. As of this afternoon, patients over the age of 18 with Virginia zip codes can schedule Covid-19 vaccinations on the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.safeway.com/health/appointments/home"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccines are indicated for people ages 65 and older, and those under 65 years of age at increased risk for severe COVID-19,” the website says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safeway’s parent company, Albertsons, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More clarity on this topic could come once the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meets from Sept. 18-19. The Virginia Department of Health said last week that it “anticipates that ACIP will vote on the updated COVID-19 vaccines at this meeting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If approved by the CDC, pharmacists will be able to administer the COVID-19 vaccine,” the department said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health agency encouraged Virginians to contact their health-care providers to ask about receiving the vaccine or request a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

Another time, trying to break a fall, he broke two bones in his left hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So in 2022, he told the oncologist who had been treating him for prostate cancer that he wanted to stop the cancer drug he had been taking, off and on, for four years: enzalutamide (sold as Xtandi).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Among the drug’s &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/203415lbl.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:listed side effects;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;listed side effects&lt;/a&gt; are higher rates of falls and fractures among patients who took it, compared with those given a placebo.

In 2023, the most recent year of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 41,000 Americans over 65 died from falls, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2837039" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:an opinion article in JAMA Health Forum;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;an opinion article in JAMA Health Forum&lt;/a&gt; pointed out last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More startling than that figure, though, was another statistic: Fall-related mortality among older adults has been climbing sharply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The author, Dr. Thomas Farley, an epidemiologist, reported that death rates from fall injuries among Americans over 65 had more than tripled over the past 30 years. Among those over 85, the cohort at highest risk, death rates from falls jumped to 339 per 100,000 in 2023, from 92 per 100,000 in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The culprit, in his view, is Americans’ reliance on prescription drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="mb-4 border-l-2 pl-5 italic text-tertiary"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Older adults are heavily medicated, increasingly so, and with drugs that are inappropriate for older people,” Dr. Farley said in an interview. “This didn’t occur &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31831549/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:in Japan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;in Japan&lt;/a&gt; or in Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Yet that same 30-year period saw a flurry of research and activity to try to reduce geriatric falls and their potentially devastating consequences, from hip fractures and brain bleeds to restricted mobility, persistent pain and institutionalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The American Geriatrics Society adopted updated &lt;a href="https://geriatrictoolkit.missouri.edu/balance/AGS-BGS-CPG-Fall-Prevention-JAGS-2011.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fall prevention guidelines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;fall prevention guidelines&lt;/a&gt; in 2011.

Geriatricians and others who research falls and prescribing practices question that conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Farley, a former New York City health commissioner who teaches at Tulane University, acknowledged that many factors contribute to falls, including the physical impairments and deteriorating eyesight associated with advancing age; alcohol abuse; and tripping hazards in people’s homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But “there’s no reason to think any of them have gotten three times worse in the past 30 years,” he said, pointing to studies showing &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568(24)00198-3/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:declines in other high-income countries;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;declines in other high-income countries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The difference, he believes, is Americans’ increasing use of medications — like benzodiazepines, opioids, antidepressants, and gabapentin — that act on the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The drugs that increase falls’ mortality are those that make you drowsy or dizzy,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Problematic drugs are numerous enough to have acquired an acronym: FRIDs, or “fall risk increasing drugs,” a category that also includes various cardiac medications and early antihistamines like Benadryl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Such medications play a major role, agreed Dr. Thomas Gill, a geriatrician and epidemiologist at Yale University and a longtime falls researcher. But, he said, “there are alternative explanations” for the increase in death rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He cited changes in reporting the causes of death, for instance. “Years ago, falls were considered a natural consequence of aging and no big deal,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Death certificates often attributed fatalities among older people to ailments like heart failure instead of falls, making fall mortality appear lower in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Today’s over-85 cohort may also be frailer and sicker than the oldest-old were 30 years ago, Dr. Gill added, because contemporary medicine can keep people alive for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Their accumulating impairments, more than the drugs they take, could make them more likely to die after a fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another skeptic, Dr. Neil Alexander, a geriatrician and falls expert at the University of Michigan and V.A. Ann Arbor Healthcare System, argued that most doctors have come to understand the dangers of FRIDs and prescribe them less often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Message delivered,” he said. Given the alarms sounded about opioids, about benzodiazepines and related drugs, and especially about opioids and benzos together, “a lot of primary care doctors have heard the gospel,” he said. “They know not to give older people Valium.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Moreover, prescriptions for some fall-related drugs have already declined or hit plateaus, even as death rates because of falls have risen. Medicare data shows &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40266-025-01237-x" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lower prescription opioid use;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;lower prescription opioid use&lt;/a&gt; beginning a decade ago, for example. Benzodiazepine prescriptions for older patients have slowed, Dr. Maust said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On the other hand, the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2820722" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:use of antidepressants;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;use of antidepressants&lt;/a&gt; and of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11233090/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gabapentin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;gabapentin&lt;/a&gt; has increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="my-4"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Whether or not medication use outweighs all other factors, “nobody disputes that these agents are overused and inappropriately used” and contribute to the troubling increase in fall death rates among seniors, Dr. Gill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Thus, the ongoing campaign for “de-prescribing” — stopping the medications whose potential harms outweigh their benefits, or reducing their dosage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We know a lot of these drugs can increase falls by 50 to 75 percent” in older patients, said Dr. Michael Steinman, a geriatrician at the University of California, San Francisco, and co-director of the &lt;a href="https://deprescribingresearch.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:US Deprescribing Research Network;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;US Deprescribing Research Network&lt;/a&gt;, established in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s easy to start meds, but it often takes a lot of time and effort to have patients stop taking them,” he said. Harried doctors may pay less attention to drug regimens than to health issues that seem more pressing, and patients can be reluctant to give up pills that seem to help with pain, insomnia, reflux and other common age-related complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Beers Criteria, a directory of drugs often deemed inadvisable for older adults, recently published &lt;a href="https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jgs.19500" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recommendations for alternative medications and nonpharmacological treatments;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;recommendations for alternative medications and nonpharmacological treatments&lt;/a&gt; for frequent problems. Cognitive behavioral therapy for sleeplessness. Exercise, physical therapy and psychological interventions for pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s a real tragedy when people have this life-altering event,” Dr. Steinman, co-chair of the Beers panel on alternatives, said of falls. He urged older patients to raise the issue of FRIDs themselves, if their doctors haven’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Ask, ‘Do any of my medications increase the risk of falls? Is there an alternative treatment?’” he suggested. “Being an informed patient or caregiver can put this on the agenda.

Harried doctors may pay less attention to drug regimens than to health issues that seem more pressing, and patients can be reluctant to give up pills that seem to help with pain, insomnia, reflux and other common age-related complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Beers Criteria, a directory of drugs often deemed inadvisable for older adults, recently published &lt;a href="https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jgs.19500" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recommendations for alternative medications and nonpharmacological treatments;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;recommendations for alternative medications and nonpharmacological treatments&lt;/a&gt; for frequent problems.

&lt;p&gt;The governor has issued executive actions that his office said would allow Connecticut residents who want COVID vaccines to be able to get them and “that coverage under state-regulated health insurance policies remains uninterrupted.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This comes at a time when new federal guidance has raised questions about who will be eligible for the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Gov. Ned Lamont issued executive actions on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His office said the state Department of Public Health is recommending that children 6 months and older receive the vaccine, as well as adults of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/health/covid-19-vaccine-complicated-process/3631179/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has OK’d new shots for adults 65 and older and younger adults who a health condition that makes them vulnerable to severe COVID-19.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As uncertainty in Washington continues, our administration is doing everything we can to ensure the residents of Connecticut have access to the health care they need to stay safe,” Lamont said in a statement. “Making vaccines accessible is grounded in health and safety, which is too important to leave to the whims of a political agenda. Vaccines have been proven for many decades to prevent serious illness, hospitalization, and death, and patients and their doctors should be able to decide what is the best course of treatment for themselves. We will not allow gridlock in Washington to put the people of our state at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state Department of Public Health has released interim guidance for the 2025-2026 season, which the governor said is similar to those issued in previous years, recommending that children 6 months and older receive the vaccine, as well as adults of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-documentcloud wp-block-embed-documentcloud"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We cannot predict which respiratory viral infection will be most prevalent this season, but we can protect our families against them and potential severe complications by getting vaccinated this fall,” Department of Public Health Commissioner Juthani said in a statement. “I am currently assembling an advisory committee to work with me on matters relating to recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the federal Food and Drug Administration using evidence-based data from peer-reviewed literature and studies. We are in the process of scheduling our first meeting for this month. I am looking forward to discussing with this group the ongoing changes at the federal level regarding vaccines and other public health recommendations to ensure that we continue to provide the best care and guidance to the people of Connecticut.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection is &lt;a href="https://portal.ct.gov/dcp/home/knowledge-base/articles/drug-control/pharmacy/covid-vaccine-guidance-update?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;providing pharmacists with guidance&lt;/a&gt; on distribution of vaccines and says pharmacists may continue to order, prescribe, and administer FDA-approved or authorized COVID-19 vaccines using the most recent CDC administration instructions until the later of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;30 days from issuance of DCP’s notice, or the vaccine’s inclusion on the CDC Adult Immunization Schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“While federal actions restrict eligibility for adults ages 18 to 65 with no underlying medical conditions, prescribers and pharmacists may order, prescribe, and administer the COVID-19 vaccine to individuals who fall outside the eligibility criteria authorized by the FDA, consistent with “off-label” use,” according to the statement from the governor’s office.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Here in Connecticut, pharmacists played a critical role in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic, and that will continue this fall as patients seek protection against the most current strains of the virus,” DCP Commissioner Bryan T. Cafferelli said in a statement. “Pharmacists are trusted frontline healthcare workers who are often the first point of contact for patients seeking vaccination. While federal vaccine schedules are in flux, we have issued interim guidance to provide clarity and consistency for our pharmacists administering COVID-19 vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Connecticut Insurance Department has issued a bulletin issued to all health insurers and health care centers in Connecticut that affirms that the state Department of Public Health interim guidance for the 2025-2026 season aligns with existing state law requiring immunization coverage in Connecticut-issued health insurance policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-provider-wordpress wp-block-embed-wordpress"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The governor’s office said, based the current guidance from the Department of Public Health and the medical academies, there will be no change to existing COVID-19 immunization coverage in Connecticut-issued insurance policies, regardless of the CDC’s position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This bulletin confirms that based on current DPH guidance, there will be no change to existing COVID-19 immunization coverage in Connecticut-issued insurance policies,” CID Commissioner Andrew Mais said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The governor’s office said pharmacists in Connecticut may continue to order, prescribe, and administer FDA-approved/authorized COVID-19 vaccines to adults using the most recent CDC administration instructions until the later of 30 days from DCP’s notice or the vaccine’s inclusion on the CDC Adult Immunization Schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pharmacists can also continue to vaccinate pursuant to a prescriber’s verbal or written prescription, and prescribers may order the vaccine consistent with FDA labeling and prevailing clinical recommendations. Vaccine supply and guidance for children will continue through the Connecticut Vaccine Program and medical homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The governor’s office said the administration is in frequent communication with public health officials from regional states in the Northeast to coordinate on a collaborative approach to these issues and the Lamont administration is researching potential legislative changes that might be needed within state statutes to “ensure continued stability in the future, regardless of any potential shifts in positions from the federal government.”&lt;/p&gt;

		The Little Round Pill That’s Winning Awards Season	&lt;/h2&gt;





&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	When EGOT winners step up to the mic, they usually thank Steven Spielberg, Bryan Lourd or whichever other deity delivered their career. Lately, though, a new name keeps sneaking into the acceptance-speech shout-outs: beta-blockers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	Over the past year, a slew of stars — from Rachel Sennott to Robert Downey Jr. — have been openly admitting that their preshow ritual involves more than Spanx and stylists. It now also includes a little pill to help to steady the hands and keep one’s pits dry.

	&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	At the 2024 Tonys, &lt;em&gt;Stereophonic&lt;/em&gt; playwright David Adjmi quipped, “Oh, no. My agent gave me a beta-blocker, but it’s not working,” before collecting his best play award. Downey cracked a similar gag at the last Golden Globes: “I took a beta-blocker, so this will be a breeze.” Kristen Bell at the 2025 SAG &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/awards/" id="auto-tag_awards_1" data-tag="awards"&gt;Awards&lt;/a&gt;, Natasha Rothwell at the 2025 Spirit Awards and Sennott at the 2025 Oscars also jokingly — perhaps not entirely — confessed to popping blockers before staring down ballrooms filled with black ties and gowns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	Doctors say the pills don’t exactly cure stage fright — they just keep the body from betraying it. “Using beta-blockers for performance anxiety is off-label, but it’s not uncommon,” notes Dr. Andrew Leuchter, director of UCLA’s neuromodulation division. “This is a drug that prevents adrenaline from activating the fight-or-flight response.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	Still, like most Hollywood quick fixes, there’s a dark side. Harvard psychiatrist Helen Riess warns that overuse or a too-high dose can lead to “a risk of fainting.” And fainting, as any publicist will tell you, makes for a much worse viral moment than a sweaty brow. — ANDREW ZUCKER

	&lt;h2 class="heading larva //   lrv-a-font-accent-l   "&gt;
		Who Launched Armani in Hollywood?  It Wasn’t Richard Gere	&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	Paul Schrader’s &lt;em&gt;American Gigolo&lt;/em&gt; gets all the credit, but it was a very different film — Brian De Palma’s &lt;em&gt;The Untouchables&lt;/em&gt; — that really put the late, great Giorgio Armani on the map. Or at least so claims one legendary Hollywood heavyweight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	“Everything Giorgio designed after that got better and better,” says former über agent Mike Ovitz, 78, who, in a completely unrelated and not-at-all self-serving coincidence, happened to package De Palma’s 1987 star-studded drama about Eliot Ness and his gang of G-men. Yes, &lt;em&gt;Untouchables&lt;/em&gt; came out seven years after &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/richard-gere/" id="auto-tag_richard-gere_1" data-tag="richard-gere"&gt;Richard Gere&lt;/a&gt; made a huge splash swanning around &lt;em&gt;Gigolo&lt;/em&gt; in Armani’s breezy, unstructured tailoring, but never mind. “All our clients were in it — Sean Connery, Kevin Costner, Bobby De Niro, Andy Garcia,” Ovitz goes on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	“I introduced Bobby and Sean to Giorgio, and he ended up getting the nod from Brian to do everybody’s wardrobe.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	History will judge which film was more responsible for making soft-shouldered, mini-malistic menswear a fashion hit, but Ovitz can rightfully grab credit for turning Armani — who died Sept. 4 at the age of 91 — into the go-to power-suit designer for Hollywood agents. “We told both the men and women in our office that they had to dress a step up — a suit and tie for the men, and the women had to dress accordingly,” Ovitz tells Rambling, recalling how, after co-founding CAA during the mid-1970s, he’d send his executives to the Armani outpost in Beverly Hills to get fitted with what quickly became the agency’s de facto uniform.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	“We gave that store a lot of business, and in return, they gave us a bit of a discount,” he says. “Not that they were losing anything by doing so — they did very well with us, and they were smart to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	What made Armani’s designs so appealing to Ovitz and his minions wasn’t just their confident power-suit cut. It was the comfort. Compared to the boxy old Brooks Brothers armor that had once dominated the agency biz, Armani felt downright breathable. “They had this loose fit, and that was novel for the time,” Ovitz says. “When you had to wear a suit from 8 in the morning until you’re getting home from a dinner at 10 p.m., comfort was important.” — LAURIE BROOKINS&lt;/p&gt;



	&lt;h2 class="heading larva //   lrv-a-font-accent-l   "&gt;
		How Emily Brontë Got Her New Bra Font	&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	Monet took inspiration from the Seine. Van Gogh found his spark in a star-filled sky. Teddy Blanks? He discovered his muse in his wife’s underwear drawer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	“Warner Bros. contacted me about doing a custom logo for their &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/wuthering-heights/" id="auto-tag_wuthering-heights_1" data-tag="wuthering-heights"&gt;Wuthering Heights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; marketing campaign,” explains the title designer behind the eye-catching fonts in the key art for Emerald Fennell’s upcoming adaptation of Emily Brontë’s bodice-ripping 19th century gothic novel. “I was working on a bunch of different designs, and my wife suggested something sultry and sexy that had lace inside of it. That’s when I came up with the idea to use one of her bras to get the texture right.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	Blanks’ wife, by the way, has highbrow literary credentials of her own — she’s former &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; book critic Molly Young — but still seems delighted to have her unmentionables plastered on posters nationwide. “From a young age I always knew my Intimate Apparel would be 1 inch from Jacob Elordi’s head, I just didn’t know how,” she recently joked on Instagram.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	Blanks started designing titles in the mid-2000s when he did the cards for Lena Dunham’s first short films, then her debut feature, 2010’s &lt;em&gt;Tiny Furniture&lt;/em&gt;. Since then, he’s gone on to create title treatments for &lt;em&gt;Barbie&lt;/em&gt; (designing a whole alphabet based on the 1980s doll packaging) as well as for Apple TV+’s trippy dystopian workplace dramedy &lt;em&gt;Severance&lt;/em&gt; (for which he just picked up his second Creative Arts Emmy).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	But the lacy logo for &lt;em&gt;Wuthering Heights&lt;/em&gt; could mark a breakthrough for Blanks and his Brooklyn-based CHIPS Studio. “I’m hoping this will become my thing — anyone who’s looking for lingerie to be placed in their title cards will come to me,” he quips. “Underwear of any kind — boxer briefs, jock straps, I’m willing to go there.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(HARTFORD, CT) – In the face of recent actions within the federal government that have created uncertainty in the ability of Americans to access COVID-19 vaccines during the upcoming respiratory virus season, Governor Ned Lamont today announced a series of executive actions his administration is implementing to ensure that Connecticut residents who wish to be vaccinated continue to have access to these vaccines and that coverage under state-regulated health insurance policies remains uninterrupted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“As uncertainty in Washington continues, our administration is doing everything we can to ensure the residents of Connecticut have access to the health care they need to stay safe,” &lt;strong&gt;Governor Lamont said&lt;/strong&gt;. “Making vaccines accessible is grounded in health and safety, which is too important to leave to the whims of a political agenda. Vaccines have been proven for many decades to prevent serious illness, hospitalization, and death, and patients and their doctors should be able to decide what is the best course of treatment for themselves. We will not allow gridlock in Washington to put the people of our state at risk.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Lamont administration’s actions include a multi-pronged approach among several state agencies, notably the Connecticut Department of Public Health (DPH), the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection (DCP), and the Connecticut Insurance Department (CID).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DPH releases interim guidance on who should receive COVID vaccines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Under the leadership of Commissioner Manisha Juthani, MD, DPH today released interim guidance for the 2025-2026 season emphasizing that vaccination remains the most effective defense against severe COVID-19. The guidance is similar to those issued in previous years, recommending that children six months and older receive the vaccine, as well as adults of all ages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The guidance was developed based on evidence-based recommendations from professional and expert medical organizations such as the recently released guidance from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/15585/AAP-Immunization-Schedule?autologincheck=redirected&amp;amp;utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;&lt;span&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (AAP), &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/08/acog-releases-updated-maternal-immunization-guidance-covid-influenza-rsv?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;&lt;span&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (ACOG), and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/news/media-center/statements/aafp-announces-fall-immunization-recommendations-reaffirming-commitment-to-vaccine-safety-and-public-health.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;American Academy of Family Physicians&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (AAFP).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We cannot predict which respiratory viral infection will be most prevalent this season, but we can protect our families against them and potential severe complications by getting vaccinated this fall,” &lt;strong&gt;Commissioner Juthani said&lt;/strong&gt;. “I am currently assembling an advisory committee to work with me on matters relating to recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the federal Food and Drug Administration using evidence-based data from peer-reviewed literature and studies. We are in the process of scheduling our first meeting for this month. I am looking forward to discussing with this group the ongoing changes at the federal level regarding vaccines and other public health recommendations to ensure that we continue to provide the best care and guidance to the people of Connecticut.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;DCP provides guidance on distribution of vaccines to pharmacists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To maintain seamless access while federal schedules are in flux, DCP today issued a guidance document to pharmacists, advising that – consistent with state law (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_400j.htm#sec_20-633"&gt;&lt;span&gt;C.G.S. § 20-633&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) – pharmacists may continue to order, prescribe, and administer FDA-approved or authorized COVID-19 vaccines using the most recent CDC administration instructions until the later of:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;30 days from issuance of DCP’s notice, or&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The vaccine’s inclusion on the CDC Adult Immunization Schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While federal actions restrict eligibility for adults ages 18 to 65 with no underlying medical conditions, prescribers and pharmacists may order, prescribe, and administer the COVID-19 vaccine to individuals who fall outside the eligibility criteria authorized by the FDA, consistent with “off-label” use.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Here in Connecticut, pharmacists played a critical role in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic, and that will continue this fall as patients seek protection against the most current strains of the virus,” &lt;strong&gt;DCP Commissioner Bryan T. Cafferelli said&lt;/strong&gt;. “Pharmacists are trusted frontline healthcare workers who are often the first point of contact for patients seeking vaccination. While federal vaccine schedules are in flux, we have issued interim guidance to provide clarity and consistency for our pharmacists administering COVID-19 vaccines.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;CID issues bulletin on insurance coverage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A bulletin issued today by CID to all health insurers and health care centers in Connecticut affirms that the DPH interim guidance for the 2025-2026 season aligns with existing state law requiring immunization coverage in Connecticut-issued health insurance policies. It also affirms that the DPH guidance is consistent with the COVID-19 immunization recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians or the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for which coverage is mandated by state law.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Based the current guidance from DPH and the medical academies, there will be no change to existing COVID-19 immunization coverage in Connecticut-issued insurance policies, regardless of the CDC’s position.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This bulletin confirms that based on current DPH guidance, there will be no change to existing COVID-19 immunization coverage in Connecticut-issued insurance policies,” &lt;strong&gt;CID Commissioner Andrew Mais said&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;What this means for Connecticut residents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Combined, these actions will help address some restrictions created by the CDC to access to the COVID-19 vaccines in Connecticut. Adults of all ages can receive COVID-19 vaccinations at pharmacies and medical practices, and children between 6 months and 18 years can receive vaccinations through pediatric providers participating in the Connecticut Vaccine Program (CVP).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additionally, these actions ensure that insurance coverage for COVID-19 vaccines based on current guidance from DPH, continues unchanged for state-regulated plans. For employers that offer self-funded (ERISA) plans, individuals should confirm their immunization benefits with their plan administrator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;What this means for Connecticut pharmacists and providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Following these actions, pharmacists in Connecticut may continue to order, prescribe, and administer FDA-approved/authorized COVID-19 vaccines to adults using the most recent CDC administration instructions until the later of 30 days from DCP’s notice or the vaccine’s inclusion on the CDC Adult Immunization Schedule.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additionally, pharmacists may continue to vaccinate pursuant to a prescriber’s verbal or written prescription, and prescribers may order the vaccine consistent with FDA labeling and prevailing clinical recommendations. Vaccine supply and guidance for children will continue through the Connecticut Vaccine Program and medical homes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next steps to bring stability amid uncertainty in the federal government&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Looking forward, Governor Lamont and officials within his administration continue to be in frequent communication with public health officials from regional states in the Northeast to coordinate on a collaborative approach to these issues. Additionally, the Lamont administration is researching potential legislative changes that may be needed within state statutes to ensure continued stability in the future, regardless of any potential shifts in positions from the federal government.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For information on how to be vaccinated in Connecticut, residents are encouraged to visit &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.easyvax.com/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;www.easyvax.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; or speak with their local pharmacy or medical provider.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
