They have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. They are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down in the environment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study checked the blood of about 300 firefighters from four departments across the country who were exposed to high levels of Pfas. The chemicals are the main ingredient in most firefighting foam, and are frequently used in “turnout gear” worn by firefighters because of their heat repelling properties&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Furlong said she was surprised to find the number of genes and biological pathways that were impacted by Pfas, which suggests the chemicals may cause or contribute to a broad range of health problems. The study did not prove the chemicals cause certain diseases, but findings point to biological changes that might precede disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Genes play a range of roles in developing or preventing disease, and Pfas essentially change the way the genes are supposed to act, Furlong said. A gene may act as tumor suppressor, but the Pfas interferes with how it expresses, which affects whether cancer develops, or the type of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For example, PFOS, among the most common and dangerous Pfas compounds, reduces levels of miR-128-1-5p, a gene tied to cancer development. Branched forms of PFOS were linked to changes in five other genes, including some that regulate cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-10" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1sbse14"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;Detox Your Kitchen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;A seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"detox-your-kitchen","successDescription":"A seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries."}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not all compounds impacted gene expressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The research found connections among Pfas-related gene changes and biological pathways involved in leukemia, as well as bladder, liver, thyroid and breast cancers. Other genes and biological pathways were involved in Alzheimer’s disease, and autoimmune and infectious diseases such as lupus, asthma and tuberculosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Furlong said it remains unclear at which step in the biological processes disease is triggered, but the picture is clear enough to point to possible treatments. Pharmaceutical companies are trying to develop drugs that could alter gene activity and potentially prevent Pfas-linked disease from developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 12:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxPa0JkUDNndi14aTFfajdoN0lDN3k4Ymwzb3haMFduLTk4QnA5UzBLNy1LUVNBaTNzQTkzSi00bmt1LS1jYmQzeWxtR09uUExNcjhDWHdyOUFLdnd2Skw4NDZRb3U4ZnhMMTNZS3NQYVdYcmlZTEc0OXI4RWlnQWxkcDBOV1lfUDZBSGd2RWJBUkprWElVeTlmaGNaV1lYUQ</guid></item><item><title>罗奇博士：补充维生素B12的适当量各不相同-底特律新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1AFBVV95cUxNNWVkY05RV25zUEFuYXlIb1hzM0Zja294V0N2b005RmJiRmU3aUZNZlV4aE1memRSNkRCMGpEa1RBRW81RmY0ZU1NZkNWdXphSDFZOVM0NVJNTG5WbVc1VE92WWlURGN1M1Z4dzlScW9xOWV6c1Nzc2t4bDJTbmxMZndaeHFhZ1kxR20wZzVwQUpEaEFrUGNfRWM1N2RUaDhHRXU5d3VORlBmMTZBQ3BnSWx5Z3BRWEROUW9KSUY5ZHR2Ml9yajJ1SHlWVHI5MGtBRWU1Sg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_by"&gt;Dr. Keith Roach&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; How much vitamin B12 should I take as a diabetic?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— T.H.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear T.H.:&lt;/strong&gt; Many people have strong feelings that vitamin B12 can dramatically improve their health, but it only helps to take vitamin B12 if you are deficient. Vitamin B12 deficiency isn't too common. Still, there are a few situations where supplemental vitamin B12 should be considered, and two of them are specific for people with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People with Type 1 diabetes, which usually presents itself during childhood, are at a high risk for other autoimmune diseases, including pernicious anemia — an autoimmune destruction of the cells in the stomach that make a protein called intrinsic factor. This protein is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12. Multiple autoimmune diseases are often diagnosed in the same person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also:&lt;/strong&gt; R&lt;a href="/story/life/advice/2025/08/13/dr-roach-rash-and-hives-develop-after-taking-an-aramotase-inhibitor/85507213007/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/life/advice/2025/08/13/dr-roach-rash-and-hives-develop-after-taking-an-aramotase-inhibitor/85507213007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;ash and hives develop after taking an aramotase inhibitor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People with Type 2 diabetes who take metformin are at risk for vitamin B12 deficiency due to poor absorption. I recommend testing vitamin B12 in people who have been on metformin for a long time. Proton-pump inhibitors (like omeprazole) may also reduce B12 absorption to the point of deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People who are very strict with avoiding any type of animal products will develop B12 deficiency over the years unless they use supplements. Finally, people who can't absorb nutrients for a variety of reasons (such as bariatric surgery, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, bacterial overgrowth, fish tapeworm, and disease of the pancreas) may all become B12-deficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Treatment of B12 deficiency depends on the underlying cause. For example, a vegan only needs about 1 mcg a day to avoid B12 deficiency. By contrast, people with pernicious anemia need 1,000 times the usual oral dose of B12 or B12 injections. Measuring B12 levels to ensure adequate supplementation is wise in people who have difficulty absorbing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For healthy people (apart from the above and a few other rare conditions) with a non-vegan diet, it is not necessary to supplement B12, nor is testing necessary. B12 toxicity is essentially unheard of since the body simply excretes the B12 that you don't need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Apart from severe absorption problems like pernicious anemia, the dosing of B12 supplementation is the same whether a person has diabetes or not. Fifty micrograms a day is almost always more than enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; Is the Naltrexone shot (for alcohol abstinence) more effective when given on one side of the body compared to the other? A person I know who receives the shots feels that it's only effective when they receive it on their right buttock. Is this possible, or could they be noticing a placebo effect?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— C.M.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear C.M.:&lt;/strong&gt; Naltrexone is an effective treatment for people with alcohol dependence. The exact effectiveness depends on the setting, but people who use naltrexone are less likely to relapse on their drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Of course the drug will be absorbed just as well from the left side as the right. However, our expectations can have a huge influence on the effectiveness of a treatment. When there is an expectation of benefit, there is a placebo effect. (When there is an expectation of harm, it's called a nocebo effect.) The placebo effect isn't as critical in a situation like antibiotics for pneumonia but can be of immense importance when the desired effect is a decrease in alcohol cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If I were this person's doctor, I would keep giving the injection on their right side.&lt;em&gt; Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 11:39:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1AFBVV95cUxNNWVkY05RV25zUEFuYXlIb1hzM0Zja294V0N2b005RmJiRmU3aUZNZlV4aE1memRSNkRCMGpEa1RBRW81RmY0ZU1NZkNWdXphSDFZOVM0NVJNTG5WbVc1VE92WWlURGN1M1Z4dzlScW9xOWV6c1Nzc2t4bDJTbmxMZndaeHFhZ1kxR20wZzVwQUpEaEFrUGNfRWM1N2RUaDhHRXU5d3VORlBmMTZBQ3BnSWx5Z3BRWEROUW9KSUY5ZHR2Ml9yajJ1SHlWVHI5MGtBRWU1Sg</guid></item><item><title>退伍军人疾病爆发导致纽约市数十人患病后，第四人死亡- ABC新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxNU01lV2I3cElFcE9qQmJwd1lDOGNKVHZlMEpjbENmblpoNDhZUnJFeHBXUDRnc2RCOWpSS3JlVmRPWFUtVkY3bmtYMmRTekN4Qi1LS3U0dkZxcWpSd0VtelRpZVhiamtqY3Fmb2U1UTltZ2JwMTFEN0F5TlpjMzdfRE5BeUR6dEx6Z1pDYTlwVDBoXzg3VTJMN1drNjBFbzdUNFI1Z2JpUXhFbXp0ckHSAbMBQVVfeXFMT1plZnZFdXRDUTNiMFhOX2NieHdMU2wwUTF4N09YNUYtN0UxdVBSSFBma0JrcEN4MDEydDVnaXpxUVR4emo1U0pMX2tTa3FFRUQ4eGw1NGxQdUVDYm1HSXdEeUVqMklXZ2I5U2NTbFlyQ3dRclV1dzNhd21tdW12VjV5Nl8zdTRIT3d6NlJDRzlVX05YZnBlTEJXajZiZXhiNjA3X0ZpUDJVUUo1b2luOFNPS1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;&lt;span class="oyrPY qlwaB AGxeB  "&gt;NEW YORK -- &lt;/span&gt;A fourth person has died in connection with a &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/article/legionnaires-disease-water-harlem-321a278807329f3843c8d37d40e09e51"&gt;Legionnaires’ disease outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in New York City, health officials disclosed Thursday as they revealed that some cooling towers that tested positive for the bacteria are in city-run buildings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The outbreak in Central Harlem has sickened dozens since it began in late July.

And if you like a glass of wine with dinner or a cocktail on the weekends, brace yourself: New guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/guidelines/high-blood-pressure" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:released Thursday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;released Thursday&lt;/a&gt; suggest you abstain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Committees from the heart organizations continuously assess the latest research so they can help medical providers figure out the best approach to &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, but this is the first new set of guidelines since 2017. Heart disease has long been the No. 1 killer in the world and blood pressure is one of the most easily modifiable ways to avoid such a death. Keeping your blood pressure in check can also reduce your risk of kidney disease, type 2 diabetes and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly half of all adults in the US have higher than normal blood pressure. The goal numbers for adults haven’t changed, according to the guidelines: Normal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg, elevated blood pressure is 120-129/80 mm Hg. If you are at 130/80 mmHg or higher, according to the new guidelines, your medical provider will want you to make some changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury, which is abbreviated as mm Hg. The measurement has an upper number, or systolic reading, and a lower number, a diastolic reading: Systolic pressure measures the force of blood as it pumps out of the heart into the arteries, and diastolic is the pressure created as the heart rests between beats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure doesn’t have any symptoms typically. But when your blood pressure is high, the force of your blood pushes against the walls of your blood vessels, making your heart less efficient, so both the vessels and heart must work harder. Without treatment, high blood pressure will eventually damage your arteries, raising your risk of having a heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How high blood pressure is treated&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new blood pressure guidelines say that if your systolic blood pressure is in the 130 to 139 range, your medical provider should first encourage you to adopt healthy lifestyle changes. After three to six months, if the lifestyle changes alone don’t lower your blood pressure to the goal range, then medication is recommended, the new guidelines say. That’s a shift from 2017 recommendation that anyone with systolic blood pressure above 140 should be prescribed lifestyle changes and medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So just trying to more aggressively control blood pressure, for it to be better for more people, to prevent cardiovascular disease, strokes, kidney disease, and now we know lowering blood pressure actually helps reduce the risk for dementia as well. So that’s really big news out of this guideline,” said Dr. Daniel Jones, American Heart Association chair of the writing committee for the guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle changes, according to the new guidelines, include maintaining or achieving a healthy weight, eating a heart-healthy diet, reducing the amount of salt in what you eat and drink, managing stress, at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week and resistance exercise like weight training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s another shift from 2017: The new guidelines also recommend forgoing alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines used to say that if people chose to drink, it should be one drink or less a day for women, and two or less a day for men. Jones said there’s just too much evidence now that alcohol negatively impacts your blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people enjoy drinking, but because the evidence is there, we want you to make an informed decision,” said Jones, who is also dean and professor emeritus of the University of Mississippi School of Medicine. “There’s a lot of individual variability with the relationship between alcohol and blood pressure, but we put forward the ideal as abstinence, and for those who choose to drink, less than one for women and less than two for men.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on a growing body of evidence, there’s also more emphasis on how important it is to lower blood pressure to reduce the risk of developing dementia, Jones said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more studies about women having trouble with &lt;a href="https://www.goredforwomen.org/en/mom-life/for-moms-with-babies-and-toddlers/expert-advice-about-high-blood-pressure-and-pregnancy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high blood pressure during pregnancy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;high blood pressure during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;, Jones said, the guidelines also newly emphasize how important it is for people who want to become pregnant or those who are pregnant to monitor their blood pressure. High blood pressure can hurt the pregnancy and can raise a person’s risk of having elevated blood pressure even long after pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietary recommendations still include the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan#:~:text=Description%20of%20the%20DASH%20Eating,sugar%2Dsweetened%20beverages%20and%20sweets" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DASH diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DASH diet &lt;/a&gt;which is a diet high on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, poultry, beans, nuts, and vegetable oils and and low on fat, sugar, and tropical oils like coconut and palm oils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also harp on sodium again and we know salt and alcohol are favorites for lots of people, but we do recommend limiting salt intake, increasing potassium intake,” Jones said. One easy way to do that is if cooking at home to use potassium-enriched salt substitutes. Sodium intake should be less than 2,300 mg per day, moving toward a more ideal limit of 1,500 mg per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with overweight or obesity, the guidelines recommend losing at least 5% of body weight. For people with more severe obesity, the guidelines recommend what Jones says are clinically proven interventions: diet and exercise, and weight loss medications &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/13901-glp-1-agonists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:including GLP-1s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;including GLP-1s&lt;/a&gt;. For people with very severe obesity, the guidelines also suggest surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones said he knows it can be difficult for people to keep their blood pressure in check, but taking these steps can help a person’s health significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The reality is the first line of things we recommend for both prevention and treatment of high blood pressure have to do with eating and we live in a very difficult environment for food. It’s hard for people to have a low sodium intake. It’s hard for people to eat enough potassium. It’s hard for people to take in a small number of calories, but the good news is that all that stuff works if you’re willing to do it,” Jones said. “It’s hard, but it works.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News Singapore</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 03:25:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxQVG45MC10M0hxMnRhSXB6YWppOHN3WGd3NXpzTGUwM1l2dEpqZFNMaTZJdzllMUdPUDJWbGdrdHQ0MW93QU5YbzZnUVlFOWxjMGVTRVFuTm9pcFc5RDVIazNwSmRneUJ6VEphSWdIV2paVE1xVTF6OUQwZGVFOEVON1JYZDFINUN2TGZjVlBn</guid></item><item><title>这种饮食有助于降低痴呆症风险，我们可能最终知道原因- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxOQ25vSVdIX3UyYmlyQ1VCMXJfU1R6WVZwNnlUdFJhMTFPSmZUanRuU2tTRnVORG9hVUdsVjd4QkJoZW1SN3N1YjR5WEJ6NzRlcjNXRi1HUlpDcF9HYi15eDk3ZTR6dnU4cWo4ZXdYNm0xZ3R2STEtN2w4QWhQUnpoYlRiU1NyRXJyaDMwQzJuRURJRlN4MHhR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean diet and others like it have been extensively linked to reducing the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mediterranean-diet-could-protect-against-a-common-form-of-liver-disease"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/12-year-study-reveals-how-the-mediterranean-diet-might-affect-your-brain"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-mediterranean-lifestyle-really-can-help-you-live-longer-study-shows"&gt;premature death&lt;/a&gt;. Now a new study provides more evidence that this choice of foods can protect against dementia – as well as giving us some clues as to why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team from Rush University Medical Center in Chicago wanted to look specifically at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIND_diet"&gt;the MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet&lt;/a&gt;, which combines elements of the Mediterranean diet with the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's a lot of acronyms, but it essentially means lots of vegetables, whole grains, fish, and poultry, and not so much dairy, red meat, and fried food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ask-yourself-these-4-questions-before-you-start-a-new-diet"&gt;Ask Yourself These 4 Questions Before You Start a New Diet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers investigated links between this balance of food items and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampal_sclerosis"&gt;hippocampal sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; – a condition linked to dementia and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="170804" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, where neurons die off in the brain's hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the postmortem brains of 809 people for whom diet information had been logged for several years before their death, the study found that those who stuck closest to the MIND diet were less likely to show signs of hippocampal sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings suggest that consuming a healthy diet, such as the MIND diet, may decrease the likelihood of hippocampal sclerosis and may support hippocampal health," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.26089"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170808" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170808" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainScan-1.jpg" alt="Brain scan" class="wp-image-170808 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainScan-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainScan-1-600x362.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170808" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers connected certain types of brain damage to diet choices. (Agarwal et al., &lt;em&gt;JAMA Netw. Open&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diet's impact on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sticking-to-the-mind-diet-could-reduce-your-risk-of-developing-dementia"&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt; has been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/major-study-links-4-healthy-diets-with-up-to-28-lower-dementia-risk"&gt;well established&lt;/a&gt; by prior research. This latest study offers fresh insight into a significant part of the reason why that link is there: the foods in the MIND diet appear to protect the hippocampus in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucial to remembering, learning, and navigating, damage to the hippocampus is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-one-isolated-brain-change-may-signal-alzheimers-study-finds"&gt;closely tied to dementia&lt;/a&gt;. While not everyone with hippocampal sclerosis has dementia, or vice versa, there's a significant overlap between the two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research accounted for a variety of demographic and genetic factors, but isn't enough to prove direct cause and effect. What it does show, together with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-say-this-one-particular-diet-may-slow-the-decline-of-the-brain"&gt;earlier studies&lt;/a&gt;, is a strong probability that dementia risk is to some extent affected by what we eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To our knowledge these are the first findings in human studies to report that the association of diet and dementia is partially mediated by hippocampal sclerosis," nutrition epidemiologist Puja Agarwal told Hannah Millington at &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/alzheimers-dementia-mind-diet-food-disease-prevention-2110316"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not clear how hippocampal sclerosis gets started, but scientists are continuing to discover more about it, and its connections to dementia. It's not the first time it's been shown that the health of this part of the brain could be &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2024.03.015"&gt;affected by diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies may endeavor to understand why this link exists. It's possible that the anti-inflammatory and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"&gt;antioxidant effects&lt;/a&gt; of the foods in the MIND diet are helping to guard the brain's neurons from damage in some way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To further understand the mechanisms linking diet and nutrients with the overall brain health, investigating diet's relationship with other biomarkers of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in the brain will be critical," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.26089"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.26089"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It starts as a painless sore where the infection entered the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This infection is easily treated with an antibiotic when caught early. If left untreated, it often progresses, over weeks or months, to a worsening rash that may be accompanied by symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, headache and fatigue, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/syphilis/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" dir="ltr"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Symptoms can resolve on their own over time but without treatment, syphilis enters a "latent stage," or asymptomatic stage, that can last for years and may progress further to a "tertiary stage" that can impact multiple organs in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/syphilis/about/about-congenital-syphilis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" dir="ltr"&gt;Congenital syphilis occurs&lt;/a&gt; when a pregnant person with untreated syphilis passes the infection to their baby either during pregnancy or at birth. It can be treated with antibiotics and it's best to treat as soon as possible to prevent more severe complications of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The CDC recommends that all pregnant people get tested for syphilis at their first health care visit after learning they are pregnant. Some places with higher rates of this infection may recommend additional screening throughout pregnancy and at birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Partridge said women of childbearing age who have barriers to prenatal care are at greater risk because they may miss out on syphilis screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I see a lot of times that moms don't get those full screenings done, they don't have access to that kind of prenatal care.

Partridge says common symptoms of congenital syphilis are known but many aren't obvious at birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I think up to 70% of babies who may meet the case definition for congenital syphilis are actually asymptomatic, which makes diagnosing it quite challenging," Partridge said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Without treatment, babies who are asymptomatic at birth can begin to show signs of the disease weeks, months or years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"If they're undetected, if the infants are left untreated, they go on to develop what we call later sequelae, and that's when you see deafness, blindness, developmental delay, the quite devastating illness," Partridge said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;Why is congenital syphilis on the rise?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. James McDonald, commissioner of the NYDOH, told ABC News that the three newborn deaths from syphilis are concerning because it's uncommon to see infant deaths from the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;McDonald said that New York State has seen 21 cases of congenital syphilis so far this year, compared to 36 cases all of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Keep in mind, these may sound like big numbers, but for upstate New York, they are big numbers," he said. "What concerns me, though, is it should be zero."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Kristin Wall, an associate professor of epidemiology at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health, told ABC News the U.S. has seen a steady rise in congenital syphilis cases over the last 10 years.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study links eating French fries three times a week to a 20% higher risk of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Baked, boiled or mashed potatoes were not tied to increased diabetes risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swapping potatoes—especially fries—for whole grains lowered risk, while replacing them with white rice raised it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potatoes may be a dinner staple, but they've long carried a mixed reputation—a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vegetables-to-eat-each-week-11746040" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nutrient-rich vegetable&lt;/a&gt; to some and a boring, unhealthy carb to others.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new analysis published in &lt;em&gt;The BMJ &lt;/em&gt;suggests it’s not the potato itself, but how it’s cooked and what you eat instead that matters.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; French fries were linked to a higher &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/processed-meat-diabetes-risk-study-11772952" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;risk of type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, while baked, boiled or mashed potatoes were not. Swapping potatoes—especially fries—for whole grains lowered that risk, but replacing them with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7918184/is-white-rice-healthy-heres-what-a-dietitian-has-to-say/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;refined carbs like white rice&lt;/a&gt; pushed it higher.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health analyzed about 30 years of diet and health data from more than 205,000 U.S. adults taking part in three major long-term studies—the Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study II and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. All were health care workers and healthy when the research began. Every two to four years, they filled out detailed food questionnaires that included questions on how often they ate different kinds of potatoes, from French fries to baked, boiled or mashed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Over time, the team identified &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/newly-diagnosed-diabetes-8584338" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;new cases of type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; through follow-up questionnaires. They used statistical models to account for factors such as age, weight, lifestyle and overall diet so they could better isolate the role potato consumption might play in diabetes risk. They also examined how risk might change if potatoes were replaced with other carbohydrate sources.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Over the course of the study, 22,299 participants developed type 2 diabetes. Those who ate more potatoes overall tended to be less active, consume more calories and have lower diet quality, with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/top-inflammatory-foods-to-limit-11779534" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;higher intakes of red meat, refined grains and sugary drinks&lt;/a&gt;. Baked, boiled or mashed potatoes were eaten much more often than French fries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After the researchers took those other lifestyle and diet factors into account, they found a clear pattern. Eating three extra servings of potatoes each week was linked to about a 5% higher rate of type 2 diabetes. The increase was much steeper for French fries, at around 20%, while baked, boiled or mashed potatoes did not show a significant change in risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When the researchers modeled different food swaps, they saw a similar pattern. Replacing three weekly servings of potatoes with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-whole-grains-for-to-improve-insulin-resistance-8424201" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt; lowered diabetes rates by about 8%. Making the same swap from fries cut the rate by about 19%. Swapping baked, boiled or mashed potatoes for whole grains resulted in a smaller 4% drop. However, replacing potatoes with white rice was linked to a higher risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s worth keeping in mind that this was an observational study, so it can’t prove that French fries directly cause type 2 diabetes. The findings show an association, meaning other unmeasured habits or health factors could still play a role in the results, even with adjustments for lifestyle and diet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study isn’t telling you to give up potatoes. Instead, it’s a reminder to pay attention to how you prepare them and what you eat alongside them. Boiled, baked or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-potato-for-mashed-potatoes-according-to-chefs-8742394" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;mashed potatoes&lt;/a&gt; can be part of a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-can-spike-your-blood-sugar-11762553" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;healthy routine&lt;/a&gt;, especially when they’re paired with vegetables, healthy fats and protein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; French fries are best enjoyed as occasional enjoyment rather than a staple. Having them once in a while is fine, but making them a frequent part of your meals can tip the balance away from your health goals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you want to make a healthier swap, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290547/whole-grain-cooking-guide/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whole grains like quinoa, farro, barley or brown rice&lt;/a&gt; are solid choices. Replacing potatoes with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047875/what-are-refined-carbs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;refined carbs&lt;/a&gt;—especially white rice—can push your risk in the opposite direction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study found that French fries, but not baked, boiled or mashed potatoes, were linked to a higher risk of type 2 diabetes—and swapping fries or total potatoes for whole grains lowered that risk. Your overall eating habits, activity level and body weight still matter more for long-term health than any single food. Potatoes can be part of a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;balanced diet&lt;/a&gt;—it’s how they’re prepared and how often you eat them that makes the difference.&lt;br&gt;

As a result, the FDA said it had notified drugmakers of its “intent to take action” against the products, but added that it wouldn't do so immediately to give patients time to switch medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bb5679" class="body-graf"&gt;“The agency urges patients taking these unapproved animal-derived thyroid medications to treat hypothyroidism to talk to their doctor,” it wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5364be" class="body-graf"&gt;The statement in and of itself was nothing surprising. Warnings about unapproved drugs are standard fare for the FDA. What followed also wasn’t unheard of: social media backlash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6fa9f4" class="body-graf"&gt;But on Wednesday evening, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary seemingly reversed course, writing in a &lt;a href="https://x.com/drmakaryfda/status/1955783788040159558?s=46"&gt;post on X that &lt;/a&gt;the FDA was committed to pursuing the first-ever approval of desiccated thyroid extract, pending results of the ongoing clinical trials. “In the mean time, we will ensure access for all Americans,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0add89" class="body-graf"&gt;Five minutes later, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. responded. “Love your approach of using gold standard science and common sense, @DrMarkaryFDA,” &lt;a href="https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1955785019194269945?s=46"&gt;Kennedy wrote&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9ffc62" class="body-graf"&gt;So, what was this all about?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-00f8fa" class="body-heading"&gt;Animal-derived thyroid pills &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f5aa62" class="body-graf"&gt;The thyroid — a small, butterfly-shaped gland located at the front of the neck — helps regulate how the body uses energy by producing thyroid hormones. When it doesn’t produce enough, it can lead to hypothyroidism, which can cause symptoms including unexplained &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/happens-stop-taking-wegovy-ozempic-many-people-regain-weight-rcna66282" target="_blank"&gt;weight gain,&lt;/a&gt; tiredness, sensitivity to cold, changes in menstrual cycles and symptoms of depression and anxiety, according &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypothyroidism/symptoms-causes/syc-20350284"&gt;to the Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. The condition is more common in women than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a6bfff" class="body-graf"&gt;The standard treatment is prescription thyroid hormone replacement therapy — basically, taking pills that contain the needed thyroid hormones. Typically one of two synthetic hormones, levothyroxine or liothyronine, or a combination of both, are prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aa1b7a" class="body-graf"&gt;Some patients, however, turn to animal-derived thyroid pills either because they don’t respond well to the synthetic versions or want to take something marketed as natural, said Dr. Michael Weintraub, an endocrinologist at ​​NYU Langone Health in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-350ec4" class="body-graf"&gt;The pills — which aren’t FDA-approved — are made from dried thyroid glands, usually from pigs, and are sold under brand names like Armour Thyroid, NP Thyroid, Nature-Thyroid and Natural Thyroid, according to the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e25719" class="body-graf"&gt;About 1.5 million people in the U.S. were prescribed animal-derived thyroid pills in 2024, the FDA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ee9441" class="body-graf"&gt;In the FDA statement warning against the animal-derived drugs, the agency said they may contain impurities that could result in infections and could also contain inconsistent levels of thyroid hormones, another risk for patients. Taking too much can cause unwanted effects, the FDA said, and too little could not be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-24024c" class="body-heading"&gt;The backlash&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-055410" class="body-graf"&gt;In the days that followed the FDA’s statement, patients and doctors took to social media to voice their opposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7986bb" class="body-graf"&gt;“BREAKING FDA set to BAN natural desiccated thyroid medications. Millions rely on these for hypothyroidism who don’t respond well to synthetic thyroid pharmaceuticals,” &lt;a href="https://x.com/drwillcole/status/1955000605740527843"&gt;read one post from Will Cole&lt;/a&gt;, a functional medicine doctor. “Let your voice be heard. The FDA needs to change course on this one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-452c82" class="body-graf"&gt;Dave Asprey, the founder of Bulletproof Coffee, a coffee and supplement brand, &lt;a href="https://x.com/daveasprey/status/1954915041163026467?s=46"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;: “I found out I had very low thyroid levels in my mid-20s, and Hashimoto’s. Normal synthetic thyroid drugs did not work. Natural thyroid extract worked very well and I have been taking it for more than 25 years without a problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4d98fb" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Robert Malone — an &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-cdc-acip-vaccine-panel-eight-new-members-rcna212477"&gt;anti-vaccine activist who was recently appointed by Kennedy to a vaccine advisory panel&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="https://x.com/rwmalonemd/status/1955775248634139070?s=46&amp;amp;t=uVo2mMUKz5lRhylxUS3GKw"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; the decision “terrible news — particularly for postmenopausal women.” He called on doctors and patients to contact the FDA in response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0ed9fe" class="body-graf"&gt;Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, did not respond to a question about whether Makary’s post on Wednesday was in response to social media backlash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e57343" class="body-graf"&gt;When asked about whether the FDA would still take action against unapproved thyroid products, Nixon referred NBC News to the agency’s statement last week, which said, “FDA is not taking immediate action against manufacturers who make unapproved animal-derived thyroid medication to give patients time to transition to an FDA-approved medication to treat their hypothyroidism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7e4b83" class="body-graf"&gt;Nixon added that the agency “will share additional information as it becomes available and as clinical trial results are released.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b88cde" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s unclear which ongoing trials Makary and Nixon were referring to. &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01739972"&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov&lt;/a&gt; lists a trial initiated by Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in 2012, but the trial’s status is currently marked as “unknown.” Allergan, the maker of Armour Thyroid, &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04124705"&gt;completed a trial in 2021&lt;/a&gt; comparing its product to levothyroxine, a synthetic thyroid hormone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-2b0364" class="body-heading"&gt;So, are these pills safe?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6f1c78" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Pieter Cohen, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said the FDA was correct to issue its initial warning about the thyroid pills, noting that the animal-derived pills aren’t regulated by the agency and can pose significant risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d28af2" class="body-graf"&gt;The FDA-approved synthetic versions usually replace one of two thyroid hormones: T4, the main hormone the thyroid produces, or T3, the active form of T4 that helps regulate energy and metabolism. Companies that make FDA-approved drugs must follow certain regulations, including consistent dosing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2fbe87" class="body-graf"&gt;The animal-derived versions also contain the thyroid hormones, just like prescription medications, Cohen said, but because they’re unregulated, the amount they contain can be all over the place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d9977b" class="body-graf"&gt;“Getting too much or too little thyroid hormone has long-term health risks,” he said. “If you take too much, it can damage your bones, it can damage your heart. If you take too little, if you’re not getting enough, a number of problems can occur too, including mood problems, like depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d94b06" class="body-graf"&gt;Weintraub, of ​​NYU Langone Health, said that tiny changes in thyroid hormone levels can have a big impact, so it’s important to get the dosage right. He noted that pigs naturally have much higher levels of T3 than humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-17ac5c" class="body-graf"&gt;“It can lead to heart rhythm disturbances, which can be life-threatening. It can lead to bone degradation, which can lead to broken bones,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5d8adc" class="body-graf"&gt;Weintraub said he’s had patients who took animal-derived thyroid pills who’ve had issues with sleeping, had sensitivity to heat or developed osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d222ce" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Susan Spratt, an endocrinologist and senior medical director for the Population Health Management Office at Duke Health in North Carolina, however, said that it would be unfair for the FDA to “suddenly yank” the animal-derived versions from the market “without dedicated reasons that they are harmful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b7e340" class="body-graf"&gt;Spratt said that the animal-derived pills have been around for decades as a prescribable drug. (Weintraub said the animal-derived drugs were “grandfathered in,” meaning they were already on the market before current FDA standards for safety were put into place.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b976d5" class="body-graf"&gt;While Spratt said she prefers to prescribe the FDA-approved synthetic versions, the animal-derived versions offer an option for people who don’t respond well to the synthetic ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8a5428" class="body-graf"&gt;“I would welcome NIH funding on why some patients don’t feel as good on T4-only products,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8876be" class="body-graf"&gt;Weintraub said the synthetic versions don’t “necessarily help everyone’s symptoms, but there’s a more precise and safer way of treating that than resorting to a pig or cow thyroids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d45447" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;He said patients who don’t respond well to T4- or T3-only medications often do better on a combination of the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 21:50:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxQQjVKMmhVdkEzbmtDemRqWER3X1dPcTcxU0RqbGxBS2N5V3VhTUNkOFlLQ1kwTVN4M3UydlBMbWlQeVNZR1hHVGR2TzRMX1h5eDhkb0o2bUhSWWZNOGZiUGhJWGJuVjNIaUhjZENiSEpiS3ZLWjQ4VE9IUmk1OWtzRnpKZFFoeWY4TW1HWC1MRV94YlJvcUhScHdnWmRrQU1MeTFlQjdRcllJZHlaV0FN0gFWQVVfeXFMUDhYaHIwSmRWaWw0RmJRUkdZWDQ1and4dlhWRF9DREhOSDdGbG4zUXZMTmJfM2VLNlVILWkyNTZfeUdwZ1pVUndZTGVyaFV6N05kcDk5UkE</guid></item><item><title>大脑编辑现在“更接近现实” ：基因改变工具解决致命疾病-自然</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX0FVX3lxTE1rdXU4WEFmTlhVREwtRHlEaU9vSl9sYmgtdE5EcTZ0emMyelRxOG1LVTl4QVVYbWZhcVJUZGh3cEZZVFo0WFpPN3kxaHktVEZHR0ZNR2UwQ2dOYUpEQmZF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02578-8/d41586-025-02578-8_51335540.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02578-8/d41586-025-02578-8_51335540.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Immunofluorescent light micrograph of stringy-looking green brain cells, containing blue and red dots on a black background" loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02578-8/d41586-025-02578-8_51335540.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Brain cells (artificially coloured) can be infected by a virus carrying the apperatus to correct disease-causing mutations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Nancy Kedersha/UCLA/Science Photo Library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are closing in on the ability to apply &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-04102-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-04102-w" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;genome editing&lt;/a&gt; to a formidable new target: &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-024-03425-y/index.html" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-024-03425-y/index.html" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;the human brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past two years, a spate of technological advances and promising results in mice have been laying the groundwork for treating &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01716-y" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01716-y" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;devastating brain disorders&lt;/a&gt; using techniques derived from &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01065-4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01065-4" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;CRISPR–Cas9 gene editing&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers hope that human trials are just a few years away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The data have never looked so good,” says Monica Coenraads, founder and chief executive of the Rett Syndrome Research Trust in Trumbull, Connecticut. “This is less and less science fiction, and closer to reality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Daunting challenge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have already developed gene-editing therapies &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01593-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01593-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;to treat diseases of the blood&lt;/a&gt;, liver and eyes. In May, researchers reported&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; a stunning success using &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01496-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01496-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;a bespoke gene-editing therapy to treat a baby boy named KJ&lt;/a&gt; with a deadly liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the brain poses special challenges.

Researchers are searching for similar particles that can selectively target the brain, which is surrounded by &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01569-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01569-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;a defensive barrier that can prevent many substances from entering&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01496-z" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02578-8/d41586-025-02578-8_50982848.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;World’s first personalized CRISPR therapy given to baby with genetic disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although KJ’s story was exciting, it was also frustrating for those whose family members have neurological diseases, says Coenraads, whose organization focuses on Rett syndrome, a rare disorder that affects brain development. “The question that I hear from our families is, ‘It was done so quickly for him. What’s taking us so long?’,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pool of concerned families is growing as physicians and families increasingly turn to genome sequencing to find the causes of once-mysterious brain disorders, says Cathleen Lutz, a geneticist at The Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine. “People are starting to now find out that their child’s seizures, for example, are related to particular genetic mutations,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Snip and stitch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies in mice suggest that gene-editing technology, which can rewrite small snippets of a cell’s genome, is ready to correct some of these mutations. In July, researchers reported&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that they had repaired mutations that, in humans, cause a disease called alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC). The condition, which typically starts causing symptoms before a child reaches 18 months old, causes seizures, learning disabilities and episodes of partial paralysis. “It’s a horrible disease,” says David Liu, a chemical biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liu and his colleagues deployed a gene-editing offshoot of CRISPR called prime editing in mice with a mutation that causes AHC. The technique corrected the mutation in about half of the brain’s cortex, a region that controls learning and memory. The mice also showed improvements in a variety of measures: their seizure-like episodes became less severe, cognition and motor control improved and lifespans lengthened. “The mouse results were dramatic,” says Liu. “We were amazed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01593-z" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02578-8/d41586-025-02578-8_51013894.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;World first: ultra-powerful CRISPR treatment trialled in a person&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liu’s laboratory is also working in mice to correct mutations that cause two other neurological disorders: Huntington’s disease and Friedreich’s ataxia in people&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. And at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine in China, neuroscientist Zilong Qiu and his colleagues have used base editing to correct a mutation in a gene called &lt;i&gt;MEF2C&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In human children, this mutation can cause epilepsy, intellectual disability and limited verbal ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In male mice, the same mutations alter how the rodents behave around fellow mice. Correction of the &lt;i&gt;Mef2c&lt;/i&gt; mutation by base editing, an ultra-precise version of CRISPR genome editing that corrects single DNA letters, restored normal social behaviour and improved the connections between nerve cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Mpox made for scary headlines in 2022 and 2023: tens of thousands of cases worldwide, with &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other/issue-brief/mpox-one-year-later-where-is-the-u-s-today/" target="_blank"&gt;30,000 in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; in just one year. There were reports of painful lesions and mammoth efforts to mobilize vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2025, it seems like just a memory. Only it's not.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You see the agony the patient goes through. It's on another level," says Caroline Mugun, a nurse at an mpox isolation ward in Mombasa, Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over the past year, the virus has spread rapidly across borders in Africa. Twenty-four African countries are in the midst of mpox outbreaks — up from 13 a year ago, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For many of these countries — from Gambia to Kenya, from Uganda to South Sudan — this is the first time they've ever seen cases of mpox.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Today — Aug. 14 — marks the one-year anniversary of the World Health Organization declaring mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. This rare distinction indicates the highest level of alert. But critics say the global response has fallen dangerously short, despite the fact that $1.1 billion has been pledged by countries, foundations and international organizations to support mpox control.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Here is a look at where the mpox crisis stands and what that means for future outbreaks of other serious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;"Walking blind"&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Historically, mpox was associated with remote forested areas in west and central Africa. The virus was known for occasionally jumping from small wild animals to people, often children who hunted them. While it was initially called monkeypox because of lab cases in primates, the main carrier is thought to be other infected animals, like rodents. The name was changed in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When the WHO rang the alarm bells a year ago, mpox had a very different profile than in its early days.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A new strain of the virus — officially called clade 1b — had just emerged and was spreading fast, particularly among sex workers and their clientele. The epicenter of this outbreak was the war-torn eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Far from the forest, this area is known for immense mineral wealth, and it attracts laborers from many of the neighboring countries. Soon, the new strain was popping up in those nearby nations: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Fast-forward a year to now, and the new strain has taken off. There have also been big outbreaks in Africa of the other mpox strain. By Africa CDC's count, there have been roughly 97,000 suspected mpox cases across the continent and nearly 600 deaths so far this year. However, mpox experts say, the numbers are likely a severe undercount.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Your case counts are kind of like shadows on a wall — they're not telling you that very precise picture," explains &lt;a href="https://ph.ucla.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/anne-rimoin" target="_blank"&gt;Anne Rimoin&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of epidemiology at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and an mpox researcher. She says there are many reasons for this, including stigma associated with a sexually transmitted disease and a large portion of affected individuals living in remote areas where there's limited surveillance and diagnostic capacity. The result is that many mpox patients are likely not getting medical care and not getting recorded in the data.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another reason for the imprecise figures is President Trump's cuts to foreign aid. The Democratic Republic of Congo was among the top recipients of U.S. foreign assistance, and some of that money went to the mpox response, including the transportation of samples from clinics to laboratories for testing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have really gone off a kind of data cliff," says &lt;a href="https://globalhealth.duke.edu/people/beyrer-chris" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Chris Beyrer&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist and director of the Duke Global Health Institute at Duke University. "We are flying blind. But since the response is so stalled, I'm not sure it's really flying. I think we're probably more like walking blind."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;What data there is suggests that the geographic reach of the virus has expanded substantially but, in recent months and weeks, the number of cases on the continent seems to be dropping. This is making &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivier-le-polain-de-waroux-95a12034/?originalSubdomain=ch" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Olivier le Polain&lt;/a&gt;, the unit head of Epidemiology and Analytics for Response at the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, optimistic. "When all the information points toward the same types of trends, it gives us some confidence that the trend is genuine," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;"Three steps backwards"&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even with cases dropping, plenty of mpox specialists are raising grave concerns about the global response.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This has basically been a very frustrating year," says &lt;a href="https://med.emory.edu/departments/medicine/divisions/infectious-diseases/studies-programs/bircwh/scholars/boghuma-titanji.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Boghuma Titanji&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at Emory University. "I feel like for every two steps of progress that have been made, there have been three steps backwards."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Titanji and others can tick off a whole range of reasons for why the virus remains uncontrolled. For starters, the epicenter of the epidemic — in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo — is in the midst of a brutal conflict, with rebels in control of key cities and little medical care available. Another big issue: This outbreak has overlapped with a dramatic drop in global health aid both from the U.S. and from a number of European countries, such as France.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Mpox can certainly serve as a textbook case study on how a global health crisis unfolds and evolves when you have biological risk colliding with political and economic forces," says Rimoin.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Vaccines&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many point to vaccines as the epitome of how the response has gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mpox is a vaccine-preventable disease, and yet, to date, only about 886,000 people have been vaccinated in a dozen African countries. Just over 3 million doses have been delivered to the continent. That's according to Africa CDC, which had previously put the target at 10 million doses available by the end of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The challenges started early on: When the WHO declared the public health emergency, it still had not green-lit the mpox vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's like: 'Well, you either have an emergency or you don't,'" says Beyrer. At the time, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the WHO, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/09/05/g-s1-20983/mpox-vaccines-africa-congo" target="_blank"&gt;pushed back&lt;/a&gt; on the notion that anyone was moving slowly, saying WHO experts didn't have complete information with which to assess the efficacy and safety of the vaccines. "We will not take shortcuts," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. vaccine donation is an example of a pledge that failed to fully materialize. Then-President Joe Biden promised to send &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/24/nx-s1-5121426/biden-mpox-unga-ukraine-gaza-sudan-ai" target="_blank"&gt;1 million doses&lt;/a&gt; to Africa in September 2024. However, as of July 2025, only about 90,000 had made it to the continent. Of the remaining doses, about half are now too close to their expiration date to ship, according to &lt;a href="https://epicentre.msf.org/en/epicentre/team/yap-boum-ii" target="_blank"&gt;Yap Boum&lt;/a&gt;, the deputy head of Africa CDC's mpox response.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They can no longer be sent to the continent, which is a huge loss, because that one dose of vaccine is $100," Boum says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Kenya, nurse Mugun — who works for Doctors Without Borders — says people want the mpox vaccine but the country has not yet launched an immunization program.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the U.S. vaccine pledge.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;What about the future? &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mpox researchers and doctors say the lackluster global response portends poorly for mpox's future potential as well as other disease threats.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Titanji of Emory University worries that the lack of response may undercut the value of the WHO alert system. Same with Africa CDC's emergency declaration, which marked the first time the body ever issued a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security. "If we have had the highest level of alert for 12 months on a particular emergency and that hasn't really put a dent in the containment, how impactful is this lever?" she asks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://africacdc.org/people/dr-jean-kaseya/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jean Kaseya&lt;/a&gt;, director-general of Africa CDC, disagrees with the suggestion that not much has happened to contain mpox. "Africa didn't have this capacity. It's now that we are building capacity," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He pointed out that a year ago, no African country had granted regulatory approval for the mpox vaccine that the U.S. was hoping to send. Now, 17 countries have approved it. Similarly, he says, the laboratory network used to test suspected mpox cases has grown significantly in the hot spots. For example, Burundi had two labs capable of testing mpox a year ago and now has 56.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Plus, he adds, this is the first time there has been coordination and collaboration across the continent with an African body helping to lead the charge and fairly allocate resources. Kaseya argues that without the emergency declaration, the resources that have been pledged would not have materialized. Still, he acknowledges, there is a lot more work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Titanji agrees there is more work to do. She warns that the world is watching in real time as the virus becomes entrenched in the human population. "The virus will evolve the more opportunities that it is given," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rimoin says that so far in this mpox emergency, the U.S. has been largely spared — but that may not last.

According to the report, the man had no prior psychiatric history when he arrived at the hospital "expressing concern that his neighbor was poisoning him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He reported that he had been distilling his own water at home and appeared paranoid about the water he was offered. After lab tests and consultation with poison control, doctors found high levels of bromide in the body, as reported by NBC News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the first 24 hours of admission, he expressed increasing paranoia and auditory and visual hallucinations, which, after attempting to escape, resulted in an involuntary psychiatric hold for grave disability," the case report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once stabilized, the man revealed that he had conducted a "personal experiment" to eliminate table salt from his diet after reading about its potential health risks. He said he had consulted ChatGPT before making the change, which he followed for three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The physicians did not have access to the man’s exact ChatGPT conversation logs. However, when they asked ChatGPT 3.5 what chloride could be replaced with, the AI suggested bromide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Though the reply stated that context matters, it did not provide a specific health warning, nor did it inquire about why we wanted to know, as we presume a medical professional would do," the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a prior statement to Fox News, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/openai" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;OpenAI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; the parent company has emphasized that the chatbot is not intended for treating any health condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have safety teams working on reducing risks and have trained our AI systems to encourage people to seek professional guidance," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report noted that bromide toxicity was more common in the early 1900s, when bromide salts were found in over-the-counter medications and sedatives and accounted for about 8% of psychiatric admissions. Today, bromide is primarily used in veterinary medicine as an anti-epileptic treatment for cats and dogs, according to the National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report said the syndrome is rare, but cases have recently re-emerged because bromide-containing substances have become more widely available online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 20:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi7AFBVV95cUxON2lZZG12UzlobDNQVzZ3cWFqd0VaSXpPU3JPVE02VGxGSW9WQWVpQVBSN3dZenIweWs2cndDY1ZiWndqRzJDSUhGU21BMHpPOU1TV0ZmVnE4TlJoWVFLY3IzRV9aRXZiNlZJVWFJWEdONlNBRERzemMwa21peDhhb016Y0NoNGpidVdnZEJZNTRYTWRwbWtYZkQybFM3dmllV3Nza0luUm85dFRNRXN2MFZqeGZPNlpPWFBWYjNjb1pYMHBBUnVFcDlQQ181Z1l2WmFwZWo0dXFBUUsyMFNNZURPa2pOVXNQWS1lX9IB8gFBVV95cUxQWFM2T3RmSkppUjFFbHVIdk1DdXM2ZWpZQUo4Y2VUaUpONEo1WDNDZXVJQUN6OEZpdDRRQXNfM1BEMUhQVDNWUDdxRWhNSElweGd0YXgtNmc3SlB1Zm04MHRxdjNCRFpoVkdPSmpQLWNVTjQwMjZPR1htdlBIRWM0TlZrMFZZdEQyZ2NOMVNuQ25KVmp1ZENFb0w3N1dWcU5tZllmT2RaOFVjbXpjRFplbDNVN2FkVkFzZnZYYVVtQ3VvWVM0STVBUEd5WVZNNEMwbVVUdGRqVnFkdm1vZTgzd0V4b3NTU0tPRGFQRWhCcWtKQQ</guid></item><item><title>新的血压指南建议提前开始治疗和不喝酒- yahoo.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxOd0ZaMHhveHJPVEktM29oblNRbDhQNUJHSVUxTFBkUzZQb28zdnVhR2hNSUhQWWFJbTFLaXNoVVp5RXNCNzVWdW91NHk4UTZyWDY4QTk0MEdFWGZmeXJ3YVpVTTRjdFU4YU56a2hiSVBUMklhVDF4aUtBbTV6OHdkcTNPVVU4QWNoYlRFVGNvcGVBbmNxRkdfcmhCUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The next time you get your blood pressure checked, expect your medical provider to be a bit more aggressive about high levels. And if you like a glass of wine with dinner or a cocktail on the weekends, brace yourself: New guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/guidelines/high-blood-pressure" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:released Thursday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;released Thursday&lt;/a&gt; suggest you abstain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Committees from the heart organizations continuously assess the latest research so they can help medical providers figure out the best approach to &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, but this is the first new set of guidelines since 2017. Heart disease has long been the No. 1 killer in the world and blood pressure is one of the most easily modifiable ways to avoid such a death. Keeping your blood pressure in check can also reduce your risk of kidney disease, type 2 diabetes and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nearly half of all adults in the US have higher than normal blood pressure. The goal numbers for adults haven’t changed, according to the guidelines: Normal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg, elevated blood pressure is 120-129/80 mm Hg. If you are at 130/80 mmHg or higher, according to the new guidelines, your medical provider will want you to make some changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury, which is abbreviated as mm Hg. The measurement has an upper number, or systolic reading, and a lower number, a diastolic reading: Systolic pressure measures the force of blood as it pumps out of the heart into the arteries, and diastolic is the pressure created as the heart rests between beats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;High blood pressure doesn’t have any symptoms typically. But when your blood pressure is high, the force of your blood pushes against the walls of your blood vessels, making your heart less efficient, so both the vessels and heart must work harder. Without treatment, high blood pressure will eventually damage your arteries, raising your risk of having a heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;How high blood pressure is treated&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The new blood pressure guidelines say that if your systolic blood pressure is in the 130 to 139 range, your medical provider should first encourage you to adopt healthy lifestyle changes. After three to six months, if the lifestyle changes alone don’t lower your blood pressure to the goal range, then medication is recommended, the new guidelines say. That’s a shift from 2017 recommendation that anyone with systolic blood pressure above 140 should be prescribed lifestyle changes and medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“So just trying to more aggressively control blood pressure, for it to be better for more people, to prevent cardiovascular disease, strokes, kidney disease, and now we know lowering blood pressure actually helps reduce the risk for dementia as well. So that’s really big news out of this guideline,” said Dr. Daniel Jones, American Heart Association chair of the writing committee for the guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Lifestyle changes, according to the new guidelines, include maintaining or achieving a healthy weight, eating a heart-healthy diet, reducing the amount of salt in what you eat and drink, managing stress, at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week and resistance exercise like weight training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There’s another shift from 2017: The new guidelines also recommend forgoing alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The guidelines used to say that if people chose to drink, it should be one drink or less a day for women, and two or less a day for men. Jones said there’s just too much evidence now that alcohol negatively impacts your blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“A lot of people enjoy drinking, but because the evidence is there, we want you to make an informed decision,” said Jones, who is also dean and professor emeritus of the University of Mississippi School of Medicine. “There’s a lot of individual variability with the relationship between alcohol and blood pressure, but we put forward the ideal as abstinence, and for those who choose to drink, less than one for women and less than two for men.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Based on a growing body of evidence, there’s also more emphasis on how important it is to lower blood pressure to reduce the risk of developing dementia, Jones said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With more studies about women having trouble with &lt;a href="https://www.goredforwomen.org/en/mom-life/for-moms-with-babies-and-toddlers/expert-advice-about-high-blood-pressure-and-pregnancy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high blood pressure during pregnancy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;high blood pressure during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;, Jones said, the guidelines also newly emphasize how important it is for people who want to become pregnant or those who are pregnant to monitor their blood pressure. High blood pressure can hurt the pregnancy and can raise a person’s risk of having elevated blood pressure even long after pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dietary recommendations still include the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan#:~:text=Description%20of%20the%20DASH%20Eating,sugar%2Dsweetened%20beverages%20and%20sweets" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DASH diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DASH diet &lt;/a&gt;which is a diet high on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, poultry, beans, nuts, and vegetable oils and and low on fat, sugar, and tropical oils like coconut and palm oils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We also harp on sodium again and we know salt and alcohol are favorites for lots of people, but we do recommend limiting salt intake, increasing potassium intake,” Jones said. One easy way to do that is if cooking at home to use potassium-enriched salt substitutes. Sodium intake should be less than 2,300 mg per day, moving toward a more ideal limit of 1,500 mg per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For people with overweight or obesity, the guidelines recommend losing at least 5% of body weight. For people with more severe obesity, the guidelines recommend what Jones says are clinically proven interventions: diet and exercise, and weight loss medications &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/13901-glp-1-agonists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:including GLP-1s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;including GLP-1s&lt;/a&gt;. For people with very severe obesity, the guidelines also suggest surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Jones said he knows it can be difficult for people to keep their blood pressure in check, but taking these steps can help a person’s health significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The reality is the first line of things we recommend for both prevention and treatment of high blood pressure have to do with eating and we live in a very difficult environment for food. It’s hard for people to have a low sodium intake. It’s hard for people to eat enough potassium. It’s hard for people to take in a small number of calories, but the good news is that all that stuff works if you’re willing to do it,” Jones said. “It’s hard, but it works.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 20:29:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxOd0ZaMHhveHJPVEktM29oblNRbDhQNUJHSVUxTFBkUzZQb28zdnVhR2hNSUhQWWFJbTFLaXNoVVp5RXNCNzVWdW91NHk4UTZyWDY4QTk0MEdFWGZmeXJ3YVpVTTRjdFU4YU56a2hiSVBUMklhVDF4aUtBbTV6OHdkcTNPVVU4QWNoYlRFVGNvcGVBbmNxRkdfcmhCUQ</guid></item><item><title>自1991年以来，爱达荷州东部居民首次确诊麻疹病例- East Idaho News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxOOWxMWDFsdFRLaW45M2tURXYtU09vNmRfWHhJODFOYXVUTHA4U1RLUXNFTlRlSDVGRXRtTXJCQmRNcmVSbjNqS2hjT0FjbXlROEFFTTk1eWg4UU5kLTF3SHpwSnY3b1Uxb09qR0pDNVFHb2JqaUh3V0VSTl9ubW9rNlJFX2JDNy1yWnNqTXlkaVMwaVVxUVhQeEFxVTdMdkQ5VUp0Q0E2bw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleText"&gt; &lt;p&gt;IDAHO FALLS – Eastern Idaho Public Health reported a second local case of measles in Bonneville County on Thursday.

The individual was hospitalized with the severe, neuroinvasive form of the mosquito-borne illness, but is now out of the hospital and recovering at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;According to public health officials, the individual was likely infected in late July near the Jordan River in the southern part of Salt Lake County. No additional details about the person are available due to health privacy laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The department said in a news release that three Salt Lake County mosquito abatement districts have tested positive for West Nile virus: Magna, Salt Lake City and South Salt Lake Valley. Statewide, 108 mosquito samples have tested positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;To look for the virus, mosquitoes are trapped and then tested. Health officials call the collections “mosquito pools.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But mosquitoes can travel several miles, so everyone in the area is encouraged to take precautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="About-West-Nile-virus" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;About West Nile virus&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;West Nile virus is carried primarily by birds and spread by certain mosquitoes. Humans get it when a mosquito bites infected birds and then humans. But unlike birds, people do not get high enough levels of the virus in their bloodstream to infect mosquitoes who might then pass it on. So humans are called “dead-end hosts,” per the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/causes/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/causes/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The CDC notes that it’s rare for a person to transmit it to someone else by way of blood transfusion, organ transplant or through pregnancy, delivery or breastfeeding. But it can happen, so those who were recently diagnosed with West Nile virus should not donate blood or bone marrow for 120 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Symptoms can appear within two days to two weeks and may include fever, headache, body aches, vomiting, diarrhea or rash. The most severe form is neuroinvasive West Nile virus, which can be very serious or even deadly. The symptoms of severe West Nile can include high fever, stiff neck, disorientation, coma, tremors and muscle weakness or seizures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;While 1 in 5 infected people develop symptoms, about 1 in 150 develop the serious, sometimes fatal illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Those most at risk of symptomatic West Nile virus are folks with compromised immune systems and adults 50 and older, per the health department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The virus has no specific treatment; rather, care providers try to manage the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Preventing-West-Nile-virus" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Preventing West Nile virus&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Since there’s no vaccine, the best prevention is avoiding mosquito bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Salt Lake County Health Department offers these tips from now until the first hard freeze: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use an EPA-registered mosquito repellent with DEET, picaridin, IR3535 or oil of lemon eucalyptus. Directions for application vary, so follow the advice on the package.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you’re outside between dusk and dawn, when the type of mosquitoes that can carry the illness are active, wear long sleeves and pants&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drain standing water in yards, including in plant trays, dog dishes, buckets and old tires.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep roof gutters clear of debris.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clean and stock garden ponds with mosquito-eating fish or mosquito dunks. For help, contact your local mosquito abatement district.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure door and window screens are in good condition so mosquitoes cannot get inside.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep weeds and tall grass cut short; adult mosquitoes look for these shady places to rest during hot days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 19:17:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQNWhCbkNpN3VtSXV5M3c0RVlxLUowbWcwNnFXV3p4LWQ1VFFXYnRzTy1DMV9DVzg0R202MzZUWjMwQUtLX0VoSWZDQVA4bHR6ZG9GdzA2UzdFaDBwX1otZ0w2UTVLZEEtZU5TYnl2S2JYajg5NDZxVzB3V0VfR1pTc0s2Vk94bXRGV1BYM0xlYWlVeTRNWHowdHFIbw</guid></item><item><title>巴西女性移民非法越境后搬到楠塔基特岛遭遇灾难--《每日邮报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxQOGFiVTAyNURuN0J4TGtnajE5Zmt0VTlrTXJYUnZ0MzEwMEwySHI5YkU0ZUw4VUlQUWNIVktYSG5DWUFEYXpnOWFfNG5HZllzUmo4b090aDlQUzMxS1JvdmZncXdqcGpiNGFUcmlWSVo3RVp3N09menRlbjZZMDBILWsxZ0xlVmZUNk9uTy1LTDZiSmhCRTI1SkpEdVdDZ3R0My1rYmR6TdIBrAFBVV95cUxONFc5b2JmbWNBOUMwTkpXTm9GYkwwd05oUHdXZVpZN3JkOVd1dFo0Tl9wMDRvNjRqUkZhVG9yNWhsYnNYRlY0c25CN1VOY0pjQ0NaNFBtVmRmQVBubGdJdU5ETFhWUC1vNFdQY3l3M0RnTktTaHhqTURMcTQ1S09vUWVCY3dOTWxpRXYxUXRxaE9YM29tVW1hWm1WTzRkbV9EbmdydmlxZFdRUi12?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

						The Massachusetts Department of Public Health is warning residents and visitors about a dangerous bacterium that can cause a flesh-eating disease in a person who was swimming at a Cape Cod beach. A rare case of Vibrio vulnificus infection — a dangerous bacterium more commonly found in Gulf Coast states — was detected in a person who swam at a beach on Buzzards Bay, officials said."People with open wounds who spend time in the water, or those who consume contaminated shellfish, can develop an infection when the bacteria enter the body. Sometimes these infections can spread through the bloodstream and cause severe, even life-threatening illness," said Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein.Some infections can lead to necrotizing fasciitis, a severe infection in which the flesh around an open wound dies.There have been seven confirmed Vibrio vulnificus cases among Massachusetts residents in the last several years, including four that were likely exposed in the Bay State, officials said.People with liver disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV, or thalassemia and those receiving immunosuppressive therapy for the treatment of disease are at greater risk for severe disease from Vibrio following exposure.Anyone with an open wound, including one from a recent surgery, piercing or tattoo, should cover it with a waterproof bandage or stay out of coastal waters.In addition to wound infections, Vibrio bacteria can also cause gastrointestinal illness when a person eats raw or undercooked seafood, particularly oysters.

So far, Stratus has been confirmed in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-variants.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-variants.html"&gt;wastewater&lt;/a&gt; in 30 states, based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But the public health giant said it’s likely COVID-19 cases are growing in 45 states and not declining anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/stratus-covid-variant-symptoms-rcna224723" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/stratus-covid-variant-symptoms-rcna224723"&gt;As Today put it&lt;/a&gt;, cases are “on the rise in nearly all U.S. states and COVID-related emergency room visits are up among all age groups, just in time for back-to-school season.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Today reported that “XFG was given its cloud-themed nickname ‘Stratus’ on X by evolutionary biologist T. Ryan Gregory, who also coined Nimbus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Stratus or XFG variant transmits easily and is spreading worldwide. Stratus is a combination of variants F.7 and LP.8.1.2. While it didn’t account for a single reported U.S. case in April, it accounted for 43% of cases by the end of June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The CDC &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; that because of lower reporting levels, the agency has moved to longer reporting periods to track variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The viral level nationally is considered “moderate,” but that’s not true of 14 states that have much more viral activity. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html"&gt;CDC wastewater map&lt;/a&gt; shows high or very high viral activity levels in a number of states, including California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado and Texas, as well as Southern states. Many of the states surrounding those states have moderate viral levels in the wastewater. In Hawaii and Louisiana, the levels are very high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The good news is that fewer people are dying or being hospitalized compared to when COVID-19 was new. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The bad news is the new strain is believed to be highly contagious, Dr. Albert Ko, professor of public health, epidemiology and medicine at Yale School of Public Health, told Today. He said both the earlier Nimbus variant and Stratus seem to be more transmissible than other variants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Today article noted that “XFG also has several unique mutations in its spike protein, which have been shown to improve the virus’s ability to evade COVID-19 antibodies from prior infection or vaccination,” per the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Already-available vaccines are reportedly effective against Stratus in terms of preventing or reducing risk of severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Symptoms-of-Stratus" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Symptoms of Stratus&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The virus’ symptoms are similar to other strains, though there are two anecdotal carveouts. While loss of taste or smell can occur, those are reportedly somewhat less likely with Stratus. And having a really, really sore throat and hoarseness have been reported to be more common with this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The other, more standard symptoms of COVID also apply:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever or chills&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breathing challenges&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Congestion or a runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle or body aches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nausea or vomiting &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diarrhea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The CDC says to get medical attention if you have:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trouble breathing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Continuing chest pain or pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Onset of confusion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inability to wake up or stay awake&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Signs of inadequate oxygen, including pale, gray or blue lips, nails and skin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 18:22:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxOYTA2R1dvR3d3NFgxaVc4b0p5NkVHYVlaUGRLNXBFSG1FWTBfS1JYYzEwcTFEWlVVZnZVSUtLbF93VjBOYU1Dc2R6ZVZWelJYakRXUGVSNTlHRG1YdUdHd1ctbi1yUkg3UHBjdHNtSnc3MUxpM0ljMzlhblI3bW8xemJmRm5FZ2w1TUE2cGwzSnZXQnIwclZZUE1qU1RlM1lpeE1oWVBRck9sWjBvN180V1dWRQ</guid></item><item><title>向ChatGPT询问如何从饮食中去除盐的男性因幻觉而住院- NBC新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxON2hlMlJYTThQakN2WjhHYWhXMjZqQlBwV3pMWENfLVd5NDZXUFVrVW9PQWpneHNmQ3Z4VlRaTFo0RHpZQjZ4QnMxTFd2U3BzVkxVRlhYMWJJekhRMWFsTVVsR0VyTG5FZ3ZjZWNuc2Zlb19heUxjRTV6aTJqMWNKMWVhSVEtaEhmcVdwU0JEdmczZlRfbEI4d2ZjUlE1ZEIwUmkyQ09NSXJmdE9WaEZUcXc4Q2FRX0pk0gFWQVVfeXFMTm5fMk5uNkg2dllTQnJfQlpKRmw1QmdZVkVSdnZpamtWVG0yQzhTaHl5TkM5SVpCOWJPOXZMS1luemd0R3JKYklTVFZ5cGdLZnR0ZnJZMkE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a6c0c8" class="body-graf"&gt;A 60-year-old man spent three weeks being treated at a hospital after replacing table salt with sodium bromide following consultation with the popular artificial intelligence bot ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d2ceb8" class="body-graf"&gt;Three physicians published a report on the case in the &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/aimcc.2024.1260" target="_blank"&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. According to the report, the man had no prior psychiatric history when he arrived at the hospital "expressing concern that his neighbor was poisoning him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3cdd8d" class="body-graf"&gt;The man shared that he had been distilling his own water at home, and the report noted he seemed "paranoid" about water he was offered. Bromism, or high levels of bromide, was considered after a lab report and consultation with poison control, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-84fa45" class="body-graf"&gt;"In the first 24 hours of admission, he expressed increasing paranoia and auditory and visual hallucinations, which, after attempting to escape, resulted in an involuntary psychiatric hold for grave disability," the case report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-64828e" class="body-graf"&gt;Once his condition improved, the man shared that he had taken it upon himself to conduct a "personal experiment" to eliminate table salt from his diet after reading about its negative health effects. The report said he did this after consulting with the chatbot ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7510a9" class="body-graf"&gt;He self-reported that the replacement went on for three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-65ba4e" class="body-graf"&gt;The three physicians, all from the University of Washington, noted in the report that they did not have access to the patient's conversation logs with ChatGPT. However, they asked ChatGPT 3.5 what chloride could be replaced with on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2ece40" class="body-graf"&gt;According to the report, the response they received included bromide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0d1e3e" class="body-graf"&gt;"Though the reply stated that context matters, it did not provide a specific health warning, nor did it inquire about why we wanted to know, as we presume a medical professional would do," the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eea390" class="body-graf"&gt;A representative for OpenAI, the company that created ChatGPT, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/chatgpt-dietary-advice-sends-man-hospital-dangerous-chemical-poisoning" target="_blank"&gt;noted in a statement to Fox News&lt;/a&gt; that its terms of service state that the bot is not to be used in the treatment of any health condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4547cf" class="body-graf"&gt;"We have safety teams working on reducing risks and have trained our AI systems to encourage people to seek professional guidance," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-71ac42" class="body-graf"&gt;Bromide toxicity was a more common toxic syndrome in the early 1900s, the report said, as it was present in a number of over-the-counter medications and sedatives. It was believed to contribute to 8% of psychiatric admissions at the time, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7be7f7" class="body-graf"&gt;Bromide salt, an inorganic compound, is now typically only used in veterinary medicine as an anti-epileptic medication for cats and dogs, &lt;a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Sodium-Bromide" target="_blank"&gt;according to the National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5fa6dc" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;It's a rare syndrome, but cases have re-emerged recently "as bromide-containing substances have become more readily available with widespread use of the internet," the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 18:17:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxON2hlMlJYTThQakN2WjhHYWhXMjZqQlBwV3pMWENfLVd5NDZXUFVrVW9PQWpneHNmQ3Z4VlRaTFo0RHpZQjZ4QnMxTFd2U3BzVkxVRlhYMWJJekhRMWFsTVVsR0VyTG5FZ3ZjZWNuc2Zlb19heUxjRTV6aTJqMWNKMWVhSVEtaEhmcVdwU0JEdmczZlRfbEI4d2ZjUlE1ZEIwUmkyQ09NSXJmdE9WaEZUcXc4Q2FRX0pk0gFWQVVfeXFMTm5fMk5uNkg2dllTQnJfQlpKRmw1QmdZVkVSdnZpamtWVG0yQzhTaHl5TkM5SVpCOWJPOXZMS1luemd0R3JKYklTVFZ5cGdLZnR0ZnJZMkE</guid></item><item><title>新的血压指南建议跳过酒精和提前开始治疗- CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE1tT1NudFVZMWJOWnhER1FuXzd1eUdQNEVSb19vTmlvRGR0Z29qak54VXZ1Wk1xX3pJUVZGZkZ6U2FuaHdxdU5RNTJna1JuenZCODRPX3l1RUVXRXhyYWFjQXMyVHkyVXBwOGIwM0JfMGVjcXFuOG1Oc29GRjjSAYIBQVVfeXFMT0FRWWZKbTFwNWE4ZmlEczlFTFJYaGFGMEJqU1FTQ0dnQ0Vadjl5eUhMdW1wcDdOT1ZlbUctQkRyeWRBdmpQWUhaWW1ldGdlU2I5ZDNLSlZVZlVJU3gtd29sTTFuSENzN2tJZk1RYUdOejBVMjBoWTdLVHNSaktUVmdNUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            The next time you get your blood pressure checked, expect your medical provider to be a bit more aggressive about high levels. And if you like a glass of wine with dinner or a cocktail on the weekends, brace yourself: New guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/guidelines/high-blood-pressure" target="_blank"&gt;released Thursday&lt;/a&gt; suggest you abstain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhjt0002336nc35tw52g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Committees from the heart organizations continuously assess the latest research so they can help medical providers figure out the best approach to &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure" target="_blank"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, but this is the first new set of guidelines since 2017. Heart disease has long been the No. 1 killer in the world and blood pressure is one of the most easily modifiable ways to avoid such a death. Keeping your blood pressure in check can also reduce your risk of kidney disease, type 2 diabetes and dementia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhjt0003336n3sm61ync@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nearly half of all adults in the US have higher than normal blood pressure. The goal numbers for adults haven’t changed, according to the guidelines: Normal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg, elevated blood pressure is 120-129/80 mm Hg. If you are at 130/80 mmHg or higher, according to the new guidelines, your medical provider will want you to make some changes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhjt0004336n8wqazbc8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury, which is abbreviated as mm Hg. The measurement has an upper number, or systolic reading, and a lower number, a diastolic reading: Systolic pressure measures the force of blood as it pumps out of the heart into the arteries, and diastolic is the pressure created as the heart rests between beats.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju0006336nj3ga9sti@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            High blood pressure doesn’t have any symptoms typically. But when your blood pressure is high, the force of your blood pushes against the walls of your blood vessels, making your heart less efficient, so both the vessels and heart must work harder. Without treatment, high blood pressure will eventually damage your arteries, raising your risk of having a heart attack or stroke.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju0007336n3m2s99ej@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new blood pressure guidelines say that if your systolic blood pressure is in the 130 to 139 range, your medical provider should first encourage you to adopt healthy lifestyle changes. After three to six months, if the lifestyle changes alone don’t lower your blood pressure to the goal range, then medication is recommended, the new guidelines say. That’s a shift from 2017 recommendation that anyone with systolic blood pressure above 140 should be prescribed lifestyle changes and medication.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju0009336nay35v8ul@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “So just trying to more aggressively control blood pressure, for it to be better for more people, to prevent cardiovascular disease, strokes, kidney disease, and now we know lowering blood pressure actually helps reduce the risk for dementia as well. So that’s really big news out of this guideline,” said Dr. Daniel Jones, American Heart Association chair of the writing committee for the guidelines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000b336n6zd4xwrd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lifestyle changes, according to the new guidelines, include maintaining or achieving a healthy weight, eating a heart-healthy diet, reducing the amount of salt in what you eat and drink, managing stress, at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week and resistance exercise like weight training.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblho37000x336nemo36zop@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s another shift from 2017: The new guidelines also recommend forgoing alcohol.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000c336nn2rdw7mx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The guidelines used to say that if people chose to drink, it should be one drink or less a day for women, and two or less a day for men. Jones said there’s just too much evidence now that alcohol negatively impacts your blood pressure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000d336ns716xoqr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A lot of people enjoy drinking, but because the evidence is there, we want you to make an informed decision,” said Jones, who is also dean and professor emeritus of the University of Mississippi School of Medicine. “There’s a lot of individual variability with the relationship between alcohol and blood pressure, but we put forward the ideal as abstinence, and for those who choose to drink, less than one for women and less than two for men.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000e336n8w37gpk4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Based on a growing body of evidence, there’s also more emphasis on how important it is to lower blood pressure to reduce the risk of developing dementia, Jones said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000f336nfuwtu7qx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With more studies about women having trouble with &lt;a href="https://www.goredforwomen.org/en/mom-life/for-moms-with-babies-and-toddlers/expert-advice-about-high-blood-pressure-and-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;high blood pressure during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;, Jones said, the guidelines also newly emphasize how important it is for people who want to become pregnant or those who are pregnant to monitor their blood pressure. High blood pressure can hurt the pregnancy and can raise a person’s risk of having elevated blood pressure even long after pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000g336nt8wtyhrd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dietary recommendations still include the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan#:~:text=Description%20of%20the%20DASH%20Eating,sugar%2Dsweetened%20beverages%20and%20sweets" target="_blank"&gt;DASH diet &lt;/a&gt;which is a diet high on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, poultry, beans, nuts, and vegetable oils and and low on fat, sugar, and tropical oils like coconut and palm oils.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000h336njjhb09c7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We also harp on sodium again and we know salt and alcohol are favorites for lots of people, but we do recommend limiting salt intake, increasing potassium intake,” Jones said. One easy way to do that is if cooking at home to use potassium-enriched salt substitutes. Sodium intake should be less than 2,300 mg per day, moving toward a more ideal limit of 1,500 mg per day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000i336nsev8vtxd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For people with overweight or obesity, the guidelines recommend losing at least 5% of body weight. For people with more severe obesity, the guidelines recommend what Jones says are clinically proven interventions: diet and exercise, and weight loss medications &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/13901-glp-1-agonists" target="_blank"&gt;including GLP-1s&lt;/a&gt;. For people with very severe obesity, the guidelines also suggest surgery.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000j336n9mtznh8k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Jones said he knows it can be difficult for people to keep their blood pressure in check, but taking these steps can help a person’s health significantly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeblbhju000k336nva3a7tyo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The reality is the first line of things we recommend for both prevention and treatment of high blood pressure have to do with eating and we live in a very difficult environment for food. It’s hard for people to have a low sodium intake. It’s hard for people to eat enough potassium. It’s hard for people to take in a small number of calories, but the good news is that all that stuff works if you’re willing to do it,” Jones said. “It’s hard, but it works.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            A group of rabbits in Colorado with grotesque, hornlike growths may seem straight out of a low-budget horror film, but scientists say there’s no reason to be spooked — the furry creatures merely have a relatively common virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmebnf12e00023b6n421d4p36@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The cottontails recently spotted in Fort Collins are infected with the mostly harmless Shope papillomavirus, which causes wart-like growths that protrude from their faces like metastasizing horns.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmebnf12e00033b6nd7z2zprb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Viral photos have inspired a fluffle of unflattering nicknames, including “Frankenstein bunnies,” “demon rabbits,” and “zombie rabbits.” But their affliction is nothing new, with the virus inspiring ancient folklore and fueling scientific research nearly 100 years ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmebnf12e00043b6np7c97cmh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The virus likely influenced the centuries-old jackalope myth in North America, which told of a rabbit with antlers or horns, among other animal variations. The disease in rabbits also contributed to scientists’ knowledge about the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmebnf12e00053b6ntqorepp3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The virus in rabbits was named after Dr. Richard E Shope, a professor at The Rockefeller University who discovered the disease in cottontails in the 1930s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmebnf12e00063b6nb8w298so@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            News about the rabbit sightings in Fort Collins, 65 miles (105 kilometers) north of Denver, started getting attention after residents started spotting them around town and posting pictures.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmebnf12e00073b6nx9vyuplb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kara Van Hoose, a spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the agency has been getting calls about the rabbits seen in Fort Collins.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmebnf12e00083b6ntt62tj09@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But she said that it’s not uncommon to see infected rabbits, especially in the summer, when the fleas and ticks that spread the virus are most active. The virus can spread from rabbit to rabbit but not to other species, including humans and pets, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmebnf12e00093b6njfhykyxo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The growths resemble warts but can look like horns if they grow longer, Van Hoose said. The growths don’t harm rabbits unless they grow on their eyes or mouths and interfere with eating. Rabbits’ immune systems are able to fight the virus and, once they do, the growths will disappear, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

However, the threat remains as bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes still carry rabies, and u&lt;span&gt;nvaccinated dogs can contract canine rabies from these wild animals and transmit it to humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;That threat was top of mind for officials at the Campbell County Department of Health in North Carolina, who, last week, alerted the public after spotting two dogs near the body of a fox that tested positive for rabies earlier this week. It is unclear whether the dogs were up to date on their rabies vaccines.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over 90 percent of animal cases reported to the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-16deb800-791e-11f0-bfbe-b9d7f6d87b6c"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; are in wildlife. And while one to three Americans die of the disease every year, the threat of exposure appears to be rising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 200 tourists from 38 states were &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14990855/rabies-outbreak-exposed-infected-bats-Wyoming.html"&gt;potentially exposed&lt;/a&gt; to the near-always fatal virus via a wild bat colony at the Jackson Lake Lodge in Wyoming between mid-May and late July. The state health department launched an all-out awareness effort to contact guests earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A rabid fox &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14998073/north-carolina-woman-attacked-rabid-fox.html"&gt;attacked and bit two people&lt;/a&gt; in separate incidents last Monday in Aberdeen, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/north-carolina/index.html" id="mol-16e7dfc0-791e-11f0-bfbe-b9d7f6d87b6c"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;. Both of them are receiving medical treatment and are expected to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without rapid treatment, consisting of a fast-acting antibody shot followed by a four-dose series of shots spread over 14 days, the disease is fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;A North Carolina mother checking what she thought was a cat under her car was suddenly attacked by a wild fox, biting her leg, then her hand as she fought it off. That same fox, which tested positive for rabies, attacked someone else about 40 minutes later&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;A 77-year-old unnamed man in North Carolina was bitten by the same animal on his leg (pictured) on his birthday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a bite, rabies infiltrates the nerves and travels to the brain, causing deadly inflammation. It destroys the brainstem, disrupting breathing and heart function while triggering aggression, hallucinations, and fear of water from throat spasms. Once symptoms appear, death follows within days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rabid animals often exhibit bizarre, unusual behavior, such as biting their own limbs, growling or drooling excessively, and stumbling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rabid bats are often unable to fly or fly in endless circles, while typically nocturnal animals, including foxes, raccoons and bats, will appear in daylight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Wyoming, State Health Officer Alexia Harrist said: ‘What we’re really concerned about is certainly people who have had actual physical contact with bats because the way that rabies is spread is through the bat’s saliva, either through a bite or a scratch.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eight cottage-style rooms at the Jackson Lake Lodge were closed on July 27 after multiple bat encounters were reported since June. The colony was settled in the hotel’s attic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Travis Riddell, director of the Teton County Public Health Department, said: ‘Although there were a lot of people exposed in this incident, one positive about it is that we know who 100 percent of those people are.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, in North Carolina, a young mother left her house to investigate what sounded like a cat under her car. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Almost immediately, a wild fox bit her leg and then her hand when she tried to get it off her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officers narrowly missed the fox, who ran into the neighboring woods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Wyoming health officials are warning 200 guests at a Grand Teton hotel about possible rabies exposure from bats between May to July, with travelers from 38 states and 7 countries at risk (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;More than 200 people may have been infected with rabies after spending the night at the Jackson Jake Lodge in Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then they got a call about a similar incident nearby.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 77-year-old unnamed man was bitten by the same fox on his leg, according to police. He was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fox, which tested positive for rabies, was caught and shot by Moore County Animal Services deputies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both people are receiving appropriate medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a rabid raccoon attacked a person and dog &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.counton2.com/news/local-news/charleston-county-news/person-dog-exposed-to-rabid-raccoon-in-charleston-county/"&gt;in a Charleston County&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood last week, health officials are issuing an urgent warning: unvaccinated pets pose a dual risk in that they can contract rabies from wildlife like raccoons and then transmit the deadly virus to humans through bites or saliva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;State officials have also reported a series of rabies cases among wild animals in recent weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most recently, Franklin County, North Carolina officials reported its 10th confirmed animal rabies case of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scott LaVigne, Franklin County Health Director, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.wral.com/news/local/franklin-county-tenth-rabies-case-august-2025/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe've%20already%20doubled%20the,been%20consistent%20with%20previous%20years."&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: ‘We’ve already doubled the number of confirmed rabies cases in Franklin County this year, more than all of 2024, and this season is not even close to being over.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just this summer, cases have also been confirmed in animals in Virginia, several towns in Maine, New York state, Texas and Washington, where a rabid bat appeared in a child’s bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 16:55:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxNc3hHZXEtbG1pR2FwVGlfTFBZTXhxRW1uV1d0VV9tc2dIa3VPWEFGSXFzOGtEbm5oNGJXOGttS2FxbTZGYlNkR3VoR2NnWnVUV29xN1JVa0ZDR3l1cWJ3SUl6WE95c00tUThfa2lqcFFRQVBySG9mZ05lRkxhZlFMOXpaZ2FEQl9KdTlaQjBZbGdGWmNfSlU5cnZnSEZoWFJTcDFRYnN3VWpJMzNoVFg3MDd2cmRlZ9IBuwFBVV95cUxOYVJRcTBGdXpoMTBmczd0MnhDUzZfNW83VXg1VTF1NV9PNGI2OWNncG9US0cwdDZZYUljTzRkSXFCS0VrVXU3VW5YV1VTLUdIRU5CdWVXR09MUTZ3LTQ0b2RzaUZGZnZIYVlQZGRqSERMMVZNc3VGR3p1dTRqQ0szM0M0Ymt5ZE9waHFKLUZuMDlPYmFjUnBBV2llZ1BhWk16dEtQVG82d3lIZ2V3NGczMHlQSm1CcFl0YV9V</guid></item><item><title>流鼻涕了吗？以下是有关夏季感冒和称为STRATUS的COVID-19变种的知识-美联社新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxORW5FTGRfcXdKa0JXTmtKMG9DaF9Jc0p5VzYxVEhINXNqczUzVDB6dzQyWVNEaEh5dGZ2UzVjcHlpSTV3NnpFTTd2bjhrNW1QQTVSandfVFFYdHRGdndvUVhmVVM3a2xZTjJJWjRyT2RjNUdVRy1NcnFmamFtbElkSjZTbnp6d1p4ZFhjSm1fdU5INmR2WklTS2htY1RZd01Id0dQVjA2UDM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AP News</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 16:39:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxORW5FTGRfcXdKa0JXTmtKMG9DaF9Jc0p5VzYxVEhINXNqczUzVDB6dzQyWVNEaEh5dGZ2UzVjcHlpSTV3NnpFTTd2bjhrNW1QQTVSandfVFFYdHRGdndvUVhmVVM3a2xZTjJJWjRyT2RjNUdVRy1NcnFmamFtbElkSjZTbnp6d1p4ZFhjSm1fdU5INmR2WklTS2htY1RZd01Id0dQVjA2UDM</guid></item><item><title>我儿子的奶奶现在不一样了。我不知道如何告诉他。-石板</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxNTVJTeVZrVWlCeGM1WkFMS0s0dEotd253ZEY1dnB0NkgxWGxtZDBiN3VPamNPZ1NpcW1vNUlVU2dJa0JuUkRvdmczUWhwcmJtenVYSGRSc3NkYjY2b2NmRWhtek9Ta2I2bkxUQVJHY0hYellTNUR3TDN4MzNESkxPZjlwYllnVnd2bk9nalhWSTFoUDQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

Last year, my husband’s 90-year-old grandmother was diagnosed with dementia. Within the last few months, she has experienced a drastic decline in her ability to recognize people. She was very close with our son, and he doesn’t understand why she can no longer remember who he is. Can you offer any advice on how to explain this to him?&lt;/p&gt;

You might start with something like: “Your grandma is sick with something called dementia—which is not the kind of sickness that will get better, like when you get a cold. Her dementia means that her brain doesn’t work in all the ways it used to. That’s why she is sometimes confused, or doesn’t always remember your name. But your grandma still loves us very much.”&lt;/p&gt;

Make sure he knows it’s okay to feel sad or worried or upset about the changes he sees in her.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebk5l68000i3b7azi2bmoul@published"&gt;I always found books to be quite helpful when introducing my kids to new concepts. If you’re not sure where to start, I’m sure the children’s librarian at your local library will be able to help. Here is one &lt;a href="https://pennmemorycenter.org/books-to-teach-children-about-ad-dementia/"&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of suggestions I found (with the caveat that I haven’t read these books myself).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebk5laz000j3b7a50w8s2xe@published"&gt;If his grandmother’s dementia worsens and she starts to behave differently as a result, you should talk about that with him, too, so he understands that it is her disease causing the changes. While he’s still so young, it might be worth trying to talk with him every time you’re planning to go visit her, whether there’s been a change or no—both so that you can remind him of the situation, and give him an opportunity to share what he’s feeling or ask you any new questions that may have occurred to him.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebk7481000q3b7akmg47jeq@published"&gt;I’ve got a 14-year-old son and 9-year-old twin daughters. My son lives primarily with his mom, but has always spent plenty of time at my place, and the kids are all quite close. But there is a real problem with how he treats one of his sisters. The two of them share many traits and are quite similar in disposition, and when things are good, they have a very sweet relationship. They’ll go on walks together and chat and laugh the whole time. They also really enjoy play-fighting—e.g., hitting each other with foam swords. But at other times, my son will relentlessly pick at his sister, teasing her for things like not being as good at video games as he is, or questioning her abilities in other ways. It’s unkind, and although she sometimes claps back or does her best to ignore him, more often it sends her into a rage.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="217" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebk7482000r3b7ap5h7rpps@published"&gt;I’ve talked to him about it repeatedly (and yelled at him about it), and he has said he has trouble controlling himself. Maybe that sounds like a cop-out, but having observed it so many times, I believe him. It seems like an impulse-control thing, like the comments pop into his head and are out of his mouth before he can stop them. We have a good amount of neurodivergence in our family, and I strongly suspect that, like the sister in question, he’s got ADHD. I’ve wanted to get him assessed, but his mom—with whom I have a good relationship—is resistant, and he hasn’t had any issues in school yet that would offer more reason to push for it. I’ll tell him to knock it off and he’ll be chastened, but then 30 seconds later he’s picking on his sister again. What do you think I should be trying to do here? Yelling obviously isn’t the answer, and I can tell my son is feeling demoralized. I feel like this is about their similar personalities to some extent, because he doesn’t have the same issue with his other sister. But even if that’s the case, I want him to stop cutting his sister down, because she adores him and I’m pretty sure he actually adores her too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebk7483000u3b7apfuzuv39@published"&gt;You didn’t mention what you’ve tried in terms of establishing clear limits or disciplining your son, but it’s clear that just talking to or reasoning with him hasn’t done the trick, nor has the fact that his treatment of his sister is having a negative impact on his relationship with the sister he presumably cares for.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebk7483000v3b7ay45w4no5@published"&gt;While I’m obviously not trying to diagnose him (plenty of neurotypical teens also have impulse control issues!), you shared that &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; strongly suspect he has ADHD or some other type of neurodivergence, and I don’t think you should ignore that instinct. You mentioned that you haven’t pushed for an assessment for your son because he doesn’t appear to be struggling in school. But a kid can be doing fine academically and still need help in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebk7483000w3b7an0he1oqg@published"&gt;Even if his apparent impulse control issues are not affecting his grades, they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; contributing to unkind and/or uncontrolled behavior and negatively affecting his relationships at home. You’re constantly frustrated with him; your daughter is hurt; if things go on like this or get worse, there could be more serious harm done to those relationships. And if your son is really “unable” to control himself, you are probably not the only ones who will have to deal with his behavior—at some point, if it’s not already happening, others will too.&lt;/p&gt;

I also understand that you’re co-parenting with his mom and the decision of exactly &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to help him change his behavior isn’t up to you alone. But when you’re truly stuck, when you’ve tried everything you can think of as a parent and nothing is getting better, that’s when it’s time to seek out more information and professional advice. I think you and your son’s mother need to have a serious conversation about this, and how to get your son the support he may need to better control himself, because the current situation is making at least two of your children unhappy and seems unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="169" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmebk34es000s4mm9g1gk6edb@published"&gt;My sister asked me to be the legal guardian for each of her children (11F and 10M) when she was pregnant, and I agreed without hesitation. At the time, I was young (23 when the oldest was born) and single. I lived about an hour away from them and figured if I did need to step in as their guardian and I didn’t have my own family established in my area, I would move to them so that the kids’ entire lives wouldn’t need to be uprooted in the wake of their parents’ deaths. I’m a teacher in a high-demand subject, so the ability to find a new job in a slightly different area isn’t of concern. When I started going out with my now-husband five years ago, I made sure he was aware of my agreement with my sister and my intent to fulfill it, if needed. He had no issue with it. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2024/10/sister-tragedy-agreement-husband-parenting-advice.html"&gt;Well, I’ve had to make good on the agreement, and my life is a disaster.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But in the case of HPV, there actually is a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/23/health/cancer-prevention-smoking-hpv-vaccination-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:public awareness remains low;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;public awareness remains low&lt;/a&gt;. Over one-third of American adults are unaware of HPV or the HPV vaccine, according to a new research letter published Thursday in the journal &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2837650" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:JAMA Oncology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;JAMA Oncology&lt;/a&gt;. In some states, the numbers are significantly higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why people need to know about HPV, the cancers linked to the virus, and the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner, and she is the mother of two young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: What is HPV, and what cancers is it linked to? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; HPV is a virus that can infect humans. There are &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20351596" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:over 100 types;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;over 100 types&lt;/a&gt; of HPV. Most HPV infections aren’t linked to cancer, but some are. The specific types of cancers associated with HPV infection are cervical cancer, cancers of the vagina, vulva, penis and anus. Some oral and throat cancers are also associated with HPV infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the cancers linked to HPV, cervical cancer is the most common. Each year in the US, there are about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cervical-cancer/statistics/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:13,000 new cases;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;13,000 new cases&lt;/a&gt; of cervical cancer. About 4,000 American women die of this cancer annually. However, as referenced in the new report, it’s not just cervical cancer — there are as many as 48,000 new cancer diagnoses linked annually to HPV. It’s important for people to understand the association between HPV and cervical cancer as well as the link to other cancer types, including the link to oropharyngeal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: Do people know if they have HPV — do they have symptoms at the time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Some types of HPV cause warts. These tend to be what’s called low-risk HPV, meaning HPV that is not linked with cancer. Infections with high-risk HPV &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-and-cancer#:~:text=Infection%20with%20high-risk%20HPV,cells%20may%20become%20cancer%20cells." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:do not cause symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;do not cause symptoms&lt;/a&gt; at the time of infection; symptoms can develop later when precancerous and cancerous cells develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-and-cancer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Cancer Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;, HPV infection is very common — so common that nearly all sexually active people become infected with HPV within a few years of becoming sexually active. As much as half of HPV infections involve high-risk HPV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most HPV infections are cleared by the body and do not result in cancer. However, some high-risk infections can persist. Over the course of many years, it can lead to the development of precancerous and then cancerous cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: How is HPV spread?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti/about/about-genital-hpv-infection.html#:~:text=HPV%20is%20most%20commonly%20spread,have%20no%20signs%20or%20symptoms." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:most common;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;most common&lt;/a&gt; way for HPV to spread is through sexual intercourse. The virus can also spread during close skin-to-skin contact during intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s crucial to understand just how widespread HPV is and how high-risk HPV is spread by asymptomatic people. Condoms can lower the risk of spreading HPV, but because HPV can infect areas that condoms don’t cover, they don’t fully protect against HPV. This is why vaccination is so important, to protect against HPV-causing cancers down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How effective is the HPV vaccine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The HPV vaccines have very high efficacy — close to 100% — for the prevention of cervical cancer in women, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hpv/hcp/vaccines.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the CDC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. The vaccines have also been found to have very high efficacy in men who have sex with men in preventing anal cancer. The vaccines also reduce the likelihood of developing genital warts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: When is the vaccine recommended to be given?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hpv/hcp/administration.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC recommends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; that preteens receive the first dose of the vaccine at age 11 or 12, though it can be given as early as age 9. For most people 9 through 14, a two-dose series is recommended, with the second shot given six to 12 months after the first. A three-dose series is recommended for people who begin vaccination at ages 15 through 45 and for immunocompromised individuals. The second shot is given one to two months after the first and the third about five months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Preteens should get the first dose of the HPV vaccine at 11 or 12, the CDC recommends. - John J. Kim/Chicago Tribune/Getty Images/File&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: I have heard some parents say that they don’t want their children to get the shot because it may encourage them to have sex earlier. How do doctors and public health experts respond to that concern? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; They would point to the data. A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2109856" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:large study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;large study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine compared over 21,000 vaccinated girls with nearly 186,000 unvaccinated peers and found &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;no evidence of increased unsafe sexual behavior.” &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593582/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Other studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Other studies&lt;/a&gt; have found no association between HPV vaccination status and age of first sexual encounter or number of sexual partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because high-risk HPV is so widespread, protecting against the cancers it can cause is essential. We are fortunate to have a vaccine that is so effective. Giving the vaccine is not about encouraging a particular behavior, but about giving protection in case someone becomes exposed to a virus someday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: What is your takeaway from this latest report?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Awareness of HPV and the HPV vaccine remains dangerously low among the general public. In seven states, more than 40% of adults were not aware of HPV; in 13 states, more than 40% were unaware of the vaccine. In 45 states and Washington, DC, more than 60% did not know that HPV could cause oral cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors concluded that “there is a critical need to enhance HPV awareness among adolescents, young adults, parents or caregivers, and pediatric and adult health care professionals.” I agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.

The system began decoding users’ internal speech – the silent dialogue in people’s minds — only when they thought of a specific keyword. This ensured that the system did not accidentally translate sentences that users would rather keep to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;i&gt;Cell&lt;/i&gt; on 14 August, represents a “technically impressive and meaningful step” towards developing BCI devices that accurately decode internal speech, says Sarah Wandelt, a neural engineer at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research in Manhasset, New York, who was not involved in the work. The password mechanism also offers a straightforward way to protect &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03423-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03423-6" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;users’ privacy, a crucial feature for real-world use&lt;/a&gt;, adds Wandelt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Avoiding eavesdropping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;BCI systems translate brain signals into text or audio and have become promising tools for restoring speech in people with paralysis or limited muscle control. Most devices require users to try to speak out loud, which can be exhausting and uncomfortable. Last year, Wandelt and her colleagues developed &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01424-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01424-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;the first BCI for decoding internal speech&lt;/a&gt;, which relied on signals in the supramarginal gyrus, a brain region that plays a major part in speech and language&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02589-5/d41586-025-02589-5_51335516.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02589-5/d41586-025-02589-5_51335516.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="A participant in a red T-shirt looks at a screen that is displaying the words 'If there is a decision to make, they speak first.'" loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02589-5/d41586-025-02589-5_51335516.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;A study participant who has trouble speaking clearly because of a stroke uses the brain–computer interface.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Emory BrainGate Team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there’s a risk that these internal-speech BCIs could accidentally decode sentences users never intended to utter, says Erin Kunz, a neural engineer at Stanford University in California. “We wanted to investigate this robustly,” says Kunz, who co-authored the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, Kunz and her colleagues analysed brain signals collected by microelectrodes placed in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00078-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00078-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;the motor cortex&lt;/a&gt; — the region involved in voluntary movements — of four participants. All four have trouble speaking, one because of a stroke and three because of motor neuron disease, a degeneration of the nerves that leads to loss of muscle control. The researchers instructed participants to either attempt to say a set of words or imagine saying them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recordings of the participants’ brain activity showed that attempted and internal speech originated in the same brain region and generated similar neural signals, but those associated with internal speech were weaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01001-6" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02589-5/d41586-025-02589-5_51086678.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Brain implant translates thoughts to speech in an instant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, Kunz and her colleagues used this data to train artificial intelligence models to recognize phonemes, the smallest units of speech, in the neural recordings. The team used language models to stitch these phonemes together to form words and sentences in real time, drawn from a vocabulary of 125,000 words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device correctly interpreted 74% of sentences imagined by two participants who were instructed to think of specific phrases. This level of accuracy is similar to that of the team’s earlier BCI for attempted speech, says Kunz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The first identified a promising starting point by searching through a library of millions of chemical fragments, eight to 19 atoms in size, and built from there. The second gave the AI free rein from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The design process also weeded out anything that looked too similar to current antibiotics. It also tried to ensure they were inventing medicines rather than soap and to filter out anything predicted to be toxic to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Scientists used AI to create antibiotics for gonorrhoea and MRSA, a type of bacteria that lives harmlessly on the skin but can cause a serious infection if it enters the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Once manufactured, the leading designs were tested on bacteria in the lab and on infected mice, resulting in two new potential drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250814-092707-b0ec5bc3fc-web-2.27.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a74e/live/921a1ca0-78f9-11f0-9c8b-7558ba906e15.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a74e/live/921a1ca0-78f9-11f0-9c8b-7558ba906e15.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a74e/live/921a1ca0-78f9-11f0-9c8b-7558ba906e15.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a74e/live/921a1ca0-78f9-11f0-9c8b-7558ba906e15.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a74e/live/921a1ca0-78f9-11f0-9c8b-7558ba906e15.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a74e/live/921a1ca0-78f9-11f0-9c8b-7558ba906e15.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a74e/live/921a1ca0-78f9-11f0-9c8b-7558ba906e15.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a74e/live/921a1ca0-78f9-11f0-9c8b-7558ba906e15.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="MIT Prof Collins is leading on his laboratory bench, wearing a burgundy shirt, with an array of pieces of scientific equipment out of focus in the background." class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;MIT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Prof James Collins, one of the researchers at MIT&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We're excited because we show that generative AI can be used to design completely new antibiotics," Prof James Collins, from MIT, tells the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"AI can enable us to come up with molecules, cheaply and quickly and in this way, expand our arsenal, and really give us a leg up in the battle of our wits against the genes of superbugs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, they are not ready for clinical trials and the drugs will require refinement – estimated to take another one to two year's work – before the long process of testing them in people could begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Andrew Edwards, from the Fleming Initiative and Imperial College London, said the work was "very significant" with "enormous potential" because it "demonstrates a novel approach to identifying new antibiotics".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But he added: "While AI promises to dramatically improve drug discovery and development, we still need to do the hard yards when it comes to testing safety and efficacy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;That can be a long and expensive process with no guarantee that the experimental medicines will be prescribed to patients at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some are calling for AI drug discovery more broadly to improve.

Of the top 80 gonorrhoea treatments designed in theory, only two were synthesised to create medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof Chris Dowson, at the University of Warwick, said the study was "cool" and showed AI was a "significant step forward as a tool for antibiotic discovery to mitigate against the emergence of resistance".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, he explains, there is also an economic problem factoring into drug-resistant infections - "how do you make drugs that have no commercial value?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;If a new antibiotic was invented, then ideally you would use it as little as possible to preserve its effectiveness, making it hard for anyone to turn a profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 15:03:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTFAzbUZpMWRobi1sUGg0WkhUNnI0WXJ2Sl9VdFdpUkxWcjBsdDBmUnNQWnpWSUF0T0tUVVh1dk82TEJNX0g3eklJWk9xOUZpM3NmdTYxaXNwclcwUdIBX0FVX3lxTE82NUhkZGdLWHFiV2FRX1JTd1ZHazhzNXplOFQyYnJfTUxEUFk5M1ppNTZzNmg0MUgzSy1DeldQelFJNmI1MEJ2NnFqM04tSU9JVURDTjJVMkQ5MG9wRF9n</guid></item><item><title>科学家说，在科罗拉多州生长角状疣的“恶魔”兔子并不危险--《卫报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxQTUlmb1dUTjE0VkdtdU85R01uUnhUclNvSE5vUllnaWhFU3hneU8xYnQwNjAySkpNTmlDNXpoeWQ5WTA5T3RHdzNTOE5UUEhzNDlOb2JKTXZOa2tvTElFWGR6MDdYWlUwU3k0bXhTQ01oSnA1VVRnUGNUemxuU25TVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A group of rabbits in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/colorado" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; with grotesque, hornlike growths may seem straight out of a low-budget horror film, but scientists say there is no reason to be spooked – the furry creatures merely have a relatively common virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The cottontails recently spotted in Fort Collins are infected with the mostly harmless Shope papillomavirus, which causes wart-like growths that protrude from their faces like metastasizing horns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"us-news","tags":[{"id":"us-news/colorado","type":"Keyword","title":"Colorado"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","type":"Keyword","title":"US news"},{"id":"us-news/west-coast","type":"Keyword","title":"West Coast"},{"id":"environment/wildlife","type":"Keyword","title":"Wildlife"},{"id":"environment/environment","type":"Keyword","title":"Environment"},{"id":"science/infectiousdiseases","type":"Keyword","title":"Infectious diseases"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/news","type":"Tone","title":"News"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/west-coast-news","type":"Tracking","title":"West Coast News"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"us-news/2025/aug/14/rabbits-horn-warts-colorado","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Viral photos have inspired a fluffle of unflattering nicknames, including “Frankenstein bunnies”, “demon rabbits” and “zombie rabbits”. But their affliction is nothing new, with the virus inspiring ancient folklore and fueling scientific research nearly 100 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The virus probably influenced the centuries-old jackalope myth in North America, which told of a rabbit with antlers or horns, among other animal variations. The disease in rabbits also contributed to scientists’ knowledge about the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The virus in rabbits was named after Dr Richard E Shope, a professor at the Rockefeller University who discovered the disease in cottontails in the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;News about the rabbit sightings in Fort Collins, 65 miles (105km) north of Denver, started getting attention after residents started spotting them around town and posting pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kara Van Hoose, a spokesperson for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/colorado" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; parks and wildlife, told the Associated Press on Wednesday that the agency had been getting calls about the rabbits seen in Fort Collins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But she said that it was not uncommon to see infected rabbits, especially in the summer, when the fleas and ticks that spread the virus are most active. The virus can spread from rabbit to rabbit but not to other species, including humans and pets, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The growths resemble warts but can look like horns if they grow longer, Van Hoose said. The growths do not harm rabbits unless they grow on their eyes or mouths and interfere with eating. Rabbits’ immune systems are able to fight the virus and, once they do, the growths disappear, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 15:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxQTUlmb1dUTjE0VkdtdU85R01uUnhUclNvSE5vUllnaWhFU3hneU8xYnQwNjAySkpNTmlDNXpoeWQ5WTA5T3RHdzNTOE5UUEhzNDlOb2JKTXZOa2tvTElFWGR6MDdYWlUwU3k0bXhTQ01oSnA1VVRnUGNUemxuU25TVQ</guid></item><item><title>科学家开发能够解码内部语音的大脑植入物-英国《金融时报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTFBFanN6UlZVMzBOYUVlcmVuVngwREthNnZXWmxTWV9JNTVsbndzMHJPajdKaG9XN1g1aHZyR2FlU3BZZ0lHZjBoVFFtWGNlcUxEdEk4b3BpVUJGMXhoM2tFX1pIMHlPOUdZeWI3N3VfdnQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="o-grid-row details-section o3-type-body-base css-pmzbjb"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Complete digital access to quality analysis and expert insights, complemented with our award-winning Weekend Print edition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Financial Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 15:00:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFBFanN6UlZVMzBOYUVlcmVuVngwREthNnZXWmxTWV9JNTVsbndzMHJPajdKaG9XN1g1aHZyR2FlU3BZZ0lHZjBoVFFtWGNlcUxEdEk4b3BpVUJGMXhoM2tFX1pIMHlPOUdZeWI3N3VfdnQ</guid></item><item><title>癌症药物在I期临床试验中消除侵袭性癌症- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxPYTQxd2ZBWFhidUozaGlJY2pQU2FBVUJKQW1rS1hpZ0djT1NCV192UTVya0RCVFMxV0tZcjctWmctZ09OZ1RXaWpMaTZPNV9TU0VBek1GekdLUWlRWElYRTZJcE1xaDhUS0xFM0Zic3JkMHpYeXdiUVFBdllZeldna1FKSWZXeTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past 20 years, a class of cancer drugs called CD40 agonist antibodies have shown great promise—and induced great disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;While effective at activating the immune system to kill cancer cells in animal models, the drugs had limited impact on patients in clinical trials and caused dangerous systemic inflammatory responses, low platelet counts, and liver toxicity, among other adverse reactions—even at a low dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in 2018, the lab of Rockefeller University's Jeffrey V. Ravetch &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-10-approach-cancer-immunotherapy-toxicity-hurdle.html"&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; it could engineer an enhanced CD40 agonist antibody so that it improved its efficacy and could be administered in a manner to limit serious side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings came from research on mice, genetically engineered to mimic the pathways relevant in humans. The next step was to have a clinical trial to see the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/drug/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;drug&lt;/a&gt;'s impact on cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the results from the Phase I clinical trial of the drug, dubbed 2141-V11, have been &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/S1535-6108(25)00319-8" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Cancer Cell&lt;/i&gt;. Of 12 patients, six patients saw their tumors shrink, including two that saw them disappear completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Seeing these significant shrinkages and even complete remission in such a small subset of patients is quite remarkable," says first author Juan Osorio, a visiting assistant professor in Ravetch's Leonard Wagner Laboratory of Molecular Genetics and Immunology and a medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, the effect wasn't limited to tumors that were injected with the drug; tumors elsewhere in the body either got smaller or were destroyed by immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This effect—where you inject locally but see a systemic response—that's not something seen very often in any clinical treatment," Ravetch notes. "It's another very dramatic and unexpected result from our trial."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Engineering enhancements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CD40 is a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cell+surface+receptor/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cell surface receptor&lt;/a&gt; and member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily, proteins that are largely expressed by immune cells. When triggered, CD40 prompts the rest of the immune system to spring into action, promoting antitumor immunity and developing tumor-specific T cell responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Ravetch's lab engineered 2141-V11, a CD40 antibody that binds tightly to human CD40 receptors and is modified to enhance its crosslinking by also engaging a specific Fc receptor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It proved to be 10 times more powerful in its capacity to elicit an antitumor immune response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They then changed how they administered the drug. The long-time approach had been to give it intravenously. But CD40 receptors are widespread, so too many non-cancerous cells pick it up, leading to the well-known toxic side effects. Instead, they injected the drug directly into tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When we did that, we saw only mild toxicity," Ravetch says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those findings became the basis of the Phase I trial described in the current study, which aimed to determine a starting clinical dose of the drug and better understand the mechanisms underlying its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inducing remission&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial included 12 patients representing myriad metastatic cancer types: melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and different types of breast cancer. Of those 12, none suffered the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/serious+side+effects/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;serious side effects&lt;/a&gt; seen with other CD40 drugs. Six experienced systemic tumor reduction, of which two had a complete response—meaning their cancer disappeared entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;The two patients who experienced complete remission had melanoma and breast cancer, respectively—both notoriously aggressive and recurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The melanoma patient had dozens of metastatic tumors on her leg and foot, and we injected just one tumor up on her thigh," Ravetch says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"After multiple injections of that one tumor, all the other tumors disappeared. The same thing happened in the patient with metastatic breast cancer, who also had tumors in her skin, liver, and lung. And even though we only injected the skin tumor, we saw all the tumors disappear."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tissue samples from the tumor sites revealed the immune activity that the drug stimulated. "We were quite surprised to see that the tumors became full of immune cells—including different types of dendritic cells, T cells, and mature B cells—that formed aggregates resembling something like a lymph node," Osorio says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The drug creates an immune microenvironment within the tumor, and essentially replaces the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/tumor/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tumor&lt;/a&gt; with these tertiary lymphoid structures."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) is associated with improved prognosis and response to immunotherapy, Osorio notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also found TLS in the tumors they didn't inject. "Once the immune system identifies the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer cells&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt; migrate to the non-injected &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/tumor/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tumor&lt;/a&gt; sites," he says.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Improving immunotherapy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings have sparked a number of other &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+trials/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; that the Ravetch lab is currently collaborating on with researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering and Duke University. Now in either Phase I or II studies, the trials are investigating 2141-V11's effect on specific cancers, including bladder cancer, prostate cancer, and glioblastoma—all aggressive and hard to treat. Collectively, nearly 200 people are enrolled in the studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These studies will help to illuminate why some patients respond to 2141-V11 and others do not—and how to potentially change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the two patients in the clinical trial whose cancer disappeared both had a high clonality of T cells—key &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;-cell killers—when they began the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This suggests there are some requirements from the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; in order for this drug to work, and we're in the process of dissecting these characteristics in more granular detail in these larger studies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As a general rule, only 25 to 30% of patients will respond to immunotherapy, so the biggest challenge in the field is to try to determine which patients will benefit from it. What are the indicators or predictors of response? And how can we convert non-responders into responders?"&lt;/p&gt;

            Imagine if there were a vaccine for breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer or any of the most well-known cancers that sicken and kill so many people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw00023b6ni46ccaeq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Every year, there are an estimated 48,000 new cases of cancers associated with the human papillomavirus, or HPV, in the United States, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/united-states-cancer-statistics/publications/hpv-associated-cancers.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. But in the case of HPV, there actually is a vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw00033b6nihfqabaz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yet &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/23/health/cancer-prevention-smoking-hpv-vaccination-wellness"&gt;public awareness remains low&lt;/a&gt;. Over one-third of American adults are unaware of HPV or the HPV vaccine, according to a new research letter published Thursday&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the journal &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2837650" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA Oncology&lt;/a&gt;. In some states, the numbers are significantly higher.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw00043b6n231ksah8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s why people need to know about HPV, the cancers linked to the virus, and the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            To help with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner, and she is the mother of two young children.

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What is HPV, and what cancers is it linked to? &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw00073b6n29o13nc4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; HPV is a virus that can infect humans. There are &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20351596" target="_blank"&gt;over 100 types&lt;/a&gt; of HPV. Most HPV infections aren’t linked to cancer, but some are. The specific types of cancers associated with HPV infection are cervical cancer, cancers of the vagina, vulva, penis and anus. Some oral and throat cancers are also associated with HPV infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw00083b6niz3pu3hc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Of the cancers linked to HPV, cervical cancer is the most common. Each year in the US, there are about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cervical-cancer/statistics/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;13,000 new cases&lt;/a&gt; of cervical cancer. About 4,000 American women die of this cancer annually. However, as referenced in the new report, it’s not just cervical cancer — there are as many as 48,000 new cancer diagnoses linked annually to HPV. It’s important for people to understand the association between HPV and cervical cancer as well as the link to other cancer types, including the link to oropharyngeal cancers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Do people know if they have HPV — do they have symptoms at the time?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000a3b6nxvkzkvyu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Some types of HPV cause warts. These tend to be what’s called low-risk HPV, meaning HPV that is not linked with cancer. Infections with high-risk HPV &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-and-cancer#:~:text=Infection%20with%20high-risk%20HPV,cells%20may%20become%20cancer%20cells." target="_blank"&gt;do not cause symptoms&lt;/a&gt; at the time of infection; symptoms can develop later when precancerous and cancerous cells develop.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000b3b6n2zpoaf1s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-and-cancer" target="_blank"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;, HPV infection is very common — so common that nearly all sexually active people&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;become infected with HPV within a few years of becoming sexually active. As much as half of HPV infections involve high-risk HPV.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000c3b6nkwr3k2vf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most HPV infections are cleared by the body and do not result in cancer. However, some high-risk infections can persist. Over the course of many years, it can lead to the development of precancerous and then cancerous cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How is HPV spread?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti/about/about-genital-hpv-infection.html#:~:text=HPV%20is%20most%20commonly%20spread,have%20no%20signs%20or%20symptoms." target="_blank"&gt;most common&lt;/a&gt; way for HPV to spread is through sexual intercourse. The virus can also spread during close skin-to-skin contact during intercourse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000f3b6nd7wx69ej@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s crucial to understand just how widespread HPV is and how high-risk HPV is spread by asymptomatic people. Condoms can lower the risk of spreading HPV, but because HPV can infect areas that condoms don’t cover, they don’t fully protect against HPV. This is why vaccination is so important, to protect against HPV-causing cancers down the line.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000g3b6ng92ih8oq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The HPV vaccines have very high efficacy — close to 100% — for the prevention of cervical cancer in women, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hpv/hcp/vaccines.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. The vaccines have also been found to have very high efficacy in men who have sex with men in preventing anal cancer. The vaccines also reduce the likelihood of developing genital warts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000i3b6ndflqdt1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hpv/hcp/administration.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; that preteens receive the first dose of the vaccine at age 11 or 12, though it can be given as early as age 9. For most people 9 through 14, a two-dose series is recommended, with the second shot given six&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to 12 months after the first. A three-dose series is recommended for people who begin vaccination at ages 15 through 45 and for immunocompromised individuals. The second shot is given one to two months after the first and the third about five&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;months later.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000k3b6nwpd81413@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: I have heard some parents say that they don’t want their children to get the shot because it may encourage them to have sex earlier. How do doctors and public health experts respond to that concern? &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000l3b6n3dkpm22u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; They would point to the data. A&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2109856" target="_blank"&gt;large study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;published in the journal&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine compared over 21,000 vaccinated girls with nearly 186,000 unvaccinated peers and found &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;no evidence of increased unsafe sexual behavior.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6593582/" target="_blank"&gt;Other studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;have found no association between HPV vaccination status and age of first sexual encounter or number of sexual partners.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeai2ryw000m3b6nzp3svi53@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because high-risk HPV is so widespread, protecting against the cancers it can cause is essential. We are fortunate to have a vaccine that is so effective. Giving the vaccine is not about encouraging a particular behavior, but about giving protection in case someone becomes exposed to a virus someday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Awareness of HPV and the HPV vaccine remains dangerously low among the general public. In seven states, more than 40% of adults were not aware of HPV; in 13 states, more than 40% were unaware of the vaccine. In 45 states and Washington, DC, more than 60% did not know that HPV could cause oral cancers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The authors concluded that “there is a critical need to enhance HPV awareness among adolescents, young adults, parents or caregivers, and pediatric and adult health care professionals.” I agree.

            &lt;p&gt;With help from artificial intelligence, MIT researchers have designed novel antibiotics that can combat two hard-to-treat infections: drug-resistant &lt;em&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt; and multi-drug-resistant &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus &lt;/em&gt;(MRSA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using generative AI algorithms, the research team designed more than 36 million possible compounds and computationally screened them for antimicrobial properties. The top candidates they discovered are structurally distinct from any existing antibiotics, and they appear to work by novel mechanisms that disrupt bacterial cell membranes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach allowed the researchers to generate and evaluate theoretical compounds that have never been seen before — a strategy that they now hope to apply to identify and design compounds with activity against other species of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re excited about the new possibilities that this project opens up for antibiotics development. Our work shows the power of AI from a drug design standpoint, and enables us to exploit much larger chemical spaces that were previously inaccessible,” says James Collins, the Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering and Science in MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES) and Department of Biological Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collins is the senior author of the study, which &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00855-4" target="_blank"&gt;appears today&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;. The paper’s lead authors are MIT postdoc Aarti Krishnan, former postdoc Melis Anahtar ’08, and Jacqueline Valeri PhD ’23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring chemical space&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past 45 years, a few dozen new antibiotics have been approved by the FDA, but most of these are variants of existing antibiotics. At the same time, bacterial resistance to many of these drugs has been growing. Globally, it is estimated that drug-resistant bacterial infections cause nearly 5 million deaths per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In hopes of finding new antibiotics to fight this growing problem, Collins and others at MIT’s &lt;a href="https://www.audaciousproject.org/grantees/collins-lab" target="_blank"&gt;Antibiotics-AI Project&lt;/a&gt; have harnessed the power of AI to screen huge libraries of existing chemical compounds. This work has yielded several promising drug candidates, including &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/artificial-intelligence-identifies-new-antibiotic-0220" target="_blank"&gt;halicin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/using-ai-scientists-combat-drug-resistant-infections-0525" target="_blank"&gt;abaucin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build on that progress, Collins and his colleagues decided to expand their search into molecules that can’t be found in any chemical libraries. By using AI to generate hypothetically possible molecules that don’t exist or haven’t been discovered, they realized that it should be possible to explore a much greater diversity of potential drug compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their new study, the researchers employed two different approaches: First, they directed generative AI algorithms to design molecules based on a specific chemical fragment that showed antimicrobial activity, and second, they let the algorithms freely generate molecules, without having to include a specific fragment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the fragment-based approach, the researchers sought to identify molecules that could kill &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt;, a Gram-negative bacterium that causes gonorrhea. They began by assembling a library of about 45 million known chemical fragments, consisting of all possible combinations of 11 atoms of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, and sulfur, along with fragments from Enamine’s REadily AccessibLe (REAL) space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, they screened the library using machine-learning models that Collins’ lab has previously trained to predict antibacterial activity against &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt;. This resulted in nearly 4 million fragments. They narrowed down that pool by removing any fragments predicted to be cytotoxic to human cells, displayed chemical liabilities, and were known to be similar to existing antibiotics. This left them with about 1 million candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to get rid of anything that would look like an existing antibiotic, to help address the antimicrobial resistance crisis in a fundamentally different way. By venturing into underexplored areas of chemical space, our goal was to uncover novel mechanisms of action,” Krishnan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through several rounds of additional experiments and computational analysis, the researchers identified a fragment they called F1 that appeared to have promising activity against &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt;. They used this fragment as the basis for generating additional compounds, using two different generative AI algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those algorithms, known as chemically reasonable mutations (CReM), works by starting with a particular molecule containing F1 and then generating new molecules by adding, replacing, or deleting atoms and chemical groups. The second algorithm, F-VAE (fragment-based variational autoencoder), takes a chemical fragment and builds it into a complete molecule. It does so by learning patterns of how fragments are commonly modified, based on its pretraining on more than 1 million molecules from the ChEMBL database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those two algorithms generated about 7 million candidates containing F1, which the researchers then computationally screened for activity against &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt;. This screen yielded about 1,000 compounds, and the researchers selected 80 of those to see if they could be produced by chemical synthesis vendors. Only two of these could be synthesized, and one of them, named NG1, was very effective at killing &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt; in a lab dish and in a mouse model of drug-resistant gonorrhea infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional experiments revealed that NG1 interacts with a protein called LptA, a novel drug target involved in the synthesis of the bacterial outer membrane. It appears that the drug works by interfering with membrane synthesis, which is fatal to cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unconstrained design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a second round of studies, the researchers explored the potential of using generative AI to freely design molecules, using Gram-positive bacteria, &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; as their target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, the researchers used CReM and VAE to generate molecules, but this time with no constraints other than the general rules of how atoms can join to form chemically plausible molecules. Together, the models generated more than 29 million compounds. The researchers then applied the same filters that they did to the &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt; candidates, but focusing on &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt;, eventually narrowing the pool down to about 90 compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were able to synthesize and test 22 of these molecules, and six of them showed strong antibacterial activity against multi-drug-resistant &lt;em&gt;S. aureus &lt;/em&gt;grown in a lab dish. They also found that the top candidate, named DN1, was able to clear a methicillin-resistant &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; (MRSA) skin infection in a mouse model. These molecules also appear to interfere with bacterial cell membranes, but with broader effects not limited to interaction with one specific protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phare Bio, a nonprofit that is also part of the Antibiotics-AI Project, is now working on further modifying NG1 and DN1 to make them suitable for additional testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a collaboration with Phare Bio, we are exploring analogs, as well as working on advancing the best candidates preclinically, through medicinal chemistry work,” Collins says. “We are also excited about applying the platforms that Aarti and the team have developed toward other bacterial pathogens of interest, notably &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded, in part, by the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency, the National Institutes of Health, the Audacious Project, Flu Lab, the Sea Grape Foundation, Rosamund Zander and Hansjorg Wyss for the Wyss Foundation, and an anonymous donor.&lt;/p&gt;
